this place is awesome  definitely authentic     my two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho  the rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever im there  and the chicken pho is always flavourful   mmmm    just thinking of it makes me want some   my boyfriend is vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at   prices are very reasonable too 
i too have been trying to book an appt to use my voucher   its been months and countless of phone calls   no response yet   agree with the buyers beware warning  i only wish reviews on this place was posted previous to my purchase of this voucher 
was always intrigued of this place when i pass by on the streetcar  finally decided to try this place out this past summer  read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say   one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten free items  when i had called to make the dinner reservation  i had asked and the hostess said  yes  we do have gluten free items that are not just salads  just let the server know when you come in   excited to find another gluten free place in town  my friends and i show up for the reservation  upon arrival  the server was really nice and friendly  when we had asked about the gluten free options  the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately  the only gluten free items are salads  which was a disppointment to us  as we had specifically asked if there were gluten free items that werent salads on the menu   so we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time  and it wasnt the servers fault that there wasnt any gluten free items  we felt bad to just get up and leave     in reading the reviews  everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine  we had ordered that to try  it wasnt bad  but not sure what the hype was about  definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing 
this place reminds of st lawrence market in toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood   fruits and veggies look so good  too bad we didnt have a kitchen at our hotel room  cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm    lots of varieties of apples 
opened by pickle barrel  glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods  they have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad   so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want   the food is ok  not memorable  the atmosphere and decor is beautiful  and the service was not bad   after hearing all the horror stories i thought we would be getting terrible service   they also have these 100 calories shooter glass desserts that are cute  but also not memorable in taste   i think this place is probably good for a drink  for the atmosphere and decor   but not so much for their food 
we had gaylord cater our wedding reception   the staff was friendly and helpful  though they were especially good with setup and tear down    the food was above average for a catering   in particular their stuffed portobello mushroom was quite nice  we also got some relatively healthy and tasty potato and vegetable dishes    they were also priced quite reasonably for what we got   a good experience all around with no major negatives   i would consider gaylord for catering again 
went for lunch with a friend who told me that she has had consistently good food here on prior occasions    my first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside  but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely   she told us the soup of the day  which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish  my friend ordered the salad and the soup and i ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side  the sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done  however i wasnt a huge fan of the bun it was in  it had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast  but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough  that said  the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty   the soup i found to have too much black pepper mixed in  the waitress asked and i mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested i mix some in  because it cuts the pepper taste    she was right  it really helped the soup  she said she does this with soups here all the time   which im not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups   my friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper  but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better    so while everything was overall a okay  it wasnt fantastic  its solid though and i would go back and try something else another time 
this is a newer location of the breakfast  brunch chain eggsmart  it has the same  basic  breakfast foods and nice  big breakfast combos  we started going to this location a few months back when we realized it was open and go every once and awhile  weve always had pretty consistent service and the food as been as good as one expects from this type of place  i usually get their two eggs combo with bacon and toast and i like it because its basic  prices are pretty good  although your non chain greasy spoon will likely have comparable for cheaper   today i had the spinach and feta cheese omelet and wasnt a fan  too much feta was rolled up in the omelet and it was all your could taste  will go with my basic again next time 
went here on a bit of a whim   just looked up italian places in the area   there seems to be a lack of consistent italian food  this place is very authentic  part grocery and part restaurant  they have a good selection on meats and cheeses and italian packaged treats  unfortunately  when we arrived around 6 on friday they didnt have much food left  they informed us this was because it was almost close  although close wasnt till 7pm   so i guess this is more of a lunch place  that said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left  we bought them both  my toddler  who hates pasta usually  loved this pasta  and i agree with him  it was delicious  my husband liked the sandwich and i also took a bite and it was yummy   we also bought some very expensive gelato  which was good  and apparently no preservatives  all natural  etc  but was very pricey at over  20 for the smallish tub  the sign in front of the gelato said large takeaway tub was  10   my husband paid  or i would have asked for clarification  i didnt know until after we left  so there was some miscommunication somewhere in there   the couple were really lovely  gave my son a little chocolate thing for free and chatted with us while we waited    i will definitely be back  especially to get more pasta  but one star off for running out of food before close and for overpriced gelato 
ive been here a few times over the years  id probably eat here more if i didnt live on the opposite side of town   ive always enjoyed my experience here and look forward to eating there again 
i used to come here back in the 90s when this was a great bar   well its no longer the 90s and its no longer a great bar 
ive eaten here a couple of times  great food  friendly staff  excellent ambiance   cant wait to visit here again 
this is probably my favorite place in all of the redrock canyon area   the first part of the hike is typical desert  brush  cactus  rocks and dirt   once you get into the canyon itself its very lush and green   be sure to check out the creek  it flows year round  ive been there in july and august and there was still water even at that hot time of year   if you were only going to do one hike in the redrock area this would be the one id recommend 
so we were looking on yelp for some place new to order from and decided to try those guys pies   we ordered the maui wowie pizza  an original cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda  the total was just over  40 00  the guy who took the order over the phone was friendly  the delivery guy was friendly  the food arrived in about 30 minutes   as far as the food goes  for the price   i was hoping it would be tastier than it was   the wings and sandwich were pretty good  i wasnt as impressed with the pizza    it wasnt bad  but i really wasnt overly impressed  ill probably try it again at some point in the future 
this was my first time ever in the side of a hobby lobby  i had to pick up a few things and thought this place might have them  it did   very large store they have everything here   the store was clean and the staff was friendly   ill definitely keep this place in mind for next time i need something they might carry 
after having ate at this restaurant at the m hotel and casino yesterday and sharing the experience with my girlfriend she was anxious to give it a try   rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us   my girlfriends review is right below mine  her name is karen  although it is very detailed and accurate  ill add a few things    she gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than i was   we each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu  both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty  i do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool   i felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed  strange as this is the same complaint i had about the one i visited yesterday    i ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie  as usual the portions are humongous    both items arrived piping hot  all of this is good but again i found the food to be only satisfactory  itll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough  the presentation is terrific          but again i just dont fell the urge to have to visit this place again   id recommend other places before recommending this place   the check was around  60 00    again we had a overall satisfactory experience  good and hot food  friendly staff  clean environment   something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars 
ive lived in vegas nearly 40 years and have seen man y shows over that time    this was the worst ive seen  boring boring boring  i guess for being in a major hotel i expected a lot more out of it   ive seen smaller shows in smaller venues that were more entertaining  they were probably less expensive to put together put at least it was fun seeing the performers put their all into a low budget production   i spent a fair chunk of the show visiting with the bartender  he was more entertaining than the show   dont waste your money on this show  from a local i can tell you for a fact that there are much better ways to blow your money in this town 
one of my favorite theaters in vegas   they had a really cute christmas arrangement of star wars characters above the ticket kiosks when i went to see rogue one there a few weeks ago   i wouldve missed it had my friend not pointed it out   you can get pretty much any assortment of food and drink here  unless you want something healthy   that means i never get anything   and the food court is right next to the entrance to the theater  all of it inside the palms casino    very convenient   they have  5 movie nights  so be sure to take advantage of those    i believe its monday nights  
yep  still sucks   had to stay here for work  not by choice   the beds are stiff and generally uncomfortable   the heating  cooling unit turns on often at any temperature   it is best to shut it off to sleep since it is extremely noisy   the television is older than me   the casino area reeks of smoke   they need to invest in some higher volume air cleaners   just walking to the elevators will require you to burn your clothes to get the odor off   there are no decent food options   lastly  they were hosting a cheerleading competition for young kids   two things  what casino would host this type of event  what organization representing children would choose a casino   as a casino you annoy and disturb all your other visitors   nothing says family like gambling  booze and smoke   great parenting 
this is a very good burger joint  i am always concerned when trying out places that are over hyped  while i do not believe it is the best burger  it is certainly worth the trip   there was a long line  it did move at a good pace though  the staff was very friendly and helpful  my food was out in no time   i ordered the shackburger and cheese fries  the burger comes topped with cheese  lettuce and shacksauce  i opted for no tomato  the burger was juicy and tasty  the bun was solid as well  the sauce is a nice complimentary flavor  the single is more than enough burger   the cheese fries come topped with a mix american and cheddar cheese as a sauce  the fries are good  the cheese was very good   i was quite happy with both the fries and the burger  new yorkers may over hype this somewhat  but it is still a very good burger 
we got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time   it was not a deal breaker  but it was annoying   our server was prompt and friendly   the bread is very good   it is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes   we ordered a few appetizers for the table   i tried the mozzarella marinara   it was surprisingly good   most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried   the mozzarella here had good flavor  and the portions are good sized   to start off my meal i ordered the side portion of the maggianos salad   i always enjoy this salad   the house dressing has good flavor   the blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too   the portion is large   for my main course i ordered the veal parmesan   the portion is huge   it comes with a side of spaghetti as well   the veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned   i have had better  but it was fine 
this is a fairly good convention center  it is relatively new looking  it is located right in the middle of downtown near hotels and food options  the food court is large  that being said it is inconvenient if you are on the main floor two levels up  there are some decent options for quick food  but it would be nice if there were at least a couple options near the show floor area   there were some food options inside the show area  these bring down the overall score  the line was tragically long and the options were severely limited  the long lines are likely a reflection of the food court being so far away 
this is an ok optional for a casual lunch  the service was ok as was the food  the place is deep and narrow with a long bar on one side  the decor is ok   the chips and salsa they bring out is ok  the chips were crispy and the salsa had ok flavor  for my meal i ordered the steak stacked quesadilla  you get a good sized portion  it should fill up most people  especially after snacking on chips and salsa  i would have liked the steak to have better flavor  it certainly could have benefitted from some seasoning  the chipotle aioli inside does make up for the bland flavor of the meat  none the less  the meat should stand on its own if needed   our server was ok  she came around with good frequency but made a few small mistakes with the orders  overall it was an ok experience 
the quality of the food is great  they are specialized in goat cheese  it is a convenient place for a romantic supper or a diner at lunch break  i would totally recommend this place  if you are a cheese addict  this is the place to be  watch out on weeknights for opening hours  thursday and friday it is opened later 
i came here the other day and for the life of me i cant remember the name of what i ordered   i highly recomend this place if you are a health nut like my self   i felt so healthy and had so much energy when i left this place   i cant wait to come back and want to try everything on the menue    
this is my favorite place to stop in at after a long day  they took the time to learn my name and order  i am greeted when i come in and the wait is almost always shorter than expected   just be aware that they do get busy in the evenings as people grab dinner on their way home   the bobby is great  but the chicken cheese steak is my favorite  always hot and yummy  great sandwhich and the price is decent 
this vons is older and looks like it on the inside  they used to make the best peanut butter cookies but for the last few months they are always burnt on the bottom or hard as a rock   the day crew is generally okay  nothing over the top or note worthy   the overnight ones boy they are odd  they really would rather be stocking than up front  its no wonder the couple in the white fiat take turns walking in filling up bags of stuff and walking right out  funny thing is i went back in and told the guy that rang me up that his shop lifters are just sitting in the parking lot and gave the lic plate number  he rolled his eyes and just said yea they have been in and out all night    so i have to pay more because your employees dont care 
best thai food in tempe  the avocado green curry is incredible  i went in the middle of the day during the summer when everyone leaves town  so i was the only one there and the staff was surprisingly unattentive given that fact  but that might not be characteristic of the place 
oh  mygod  ohmygod    i thought the first time i came here and only enjoyed coffee that it was spectacular  then i came back for the crepes  consider my mind blown   not only does the outside have major curb appeal  love the use of color   but you can sit at a coffee bar or outside    or in this whole other room  come on  with that many seating options  theres something for everyone   one night i was there  a movie was playing outside  this is the kind of place people can come back to  and the kind of place that phoenix desperately needs downtown   the stars reached their highest notch though when i went against my gut instinct and ordered the peanut butter cup crepe  see  im a huge fan of the reeses cup  however  i feel it is nearly impossible to imitate  no one gets that flavor combination right and i end up being sadly disappointed   if this is your fear too    order the peanut butter cup crepe from jobot  it was like taking a bunch of reeses and melting them in a crepe  i will still full from dinner  but ill be damned if i didnt eat that entire thing   the staff was super friendly  having conversations with a friend and i as we sat at the counter and indulged our sweet tooth   is sweet teeth a word   ill be back   as often as i can manage   
the short summary  i now officially love flw and the tour i took convinced me to get a membership the next time i go back    two friends and i wandered here a few months ago to get our culture on  we took the 90 minute guided tour i believe  everything was so gorgeous and our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable  he was able to not just preach at us with lines hed rehearsed over and over again  but tell a story and show how this knowledge applies to life today    we were able to take pictures during this tour which doesnt happen in a lot of museums these days and i took everything i could until my camera died    i left feeling completely inspired and awaiting my next visit 
i wasnt going to write a review for bw3s since we ended up not dining there the evening we stopped in  but i felt compelled to warn others about special event nights there    we happened to swing by for a birthday gathering when we were informed of the special event night for boxing  the price was going to be  10 a person whether you were watching or not  i get that  and we all understood and then promptly stepped to the side to discuss another place to go   however  i was extremely dumbfounded when a couple walked in with their infant baby   infant baby and were told the total cost for them to watch the event would be  30   10  ea   they seriously  charged  for the infant baby   ridiculous  makes me sad because i really heart bw3s most of the time 
i had been hearing about gangplank for as long as i can remember  my first encounter was towards the beginning of this year when i swung by for a peak during an event  i absolutely fell in love with the space and the concept  since then  i have been holding my ixda phoenix events there and heading to gangplank for other meetings and events  they have been so helpful by not only allowing me to hold ixda phoenix there  but also asking me if id like a permanent spot on their calendar    its a perfect spot to foster collaboration  ideas  and discussion  there are white boards  tons of tables and chairs  wifi and so much more  people are always there to bounce ideas off of  and you cant help but be inspired when you sit down and get ready to accomplish a goal   most recently i was there for the reopen phoenix event last night  i love music and get a kick out of seeing the results of collaboration of different styles and genres so i thought i would sit in for a bit and have a listen  i ended up staying there until the very end  the music was fantastic  it was great to meet new people  and i ended up being able to get some work done all at the same time  this definitely needs to happen more often   truly a great place to spend a few hours at if you need to get something accomplished  great things happen here 
z pizza is one of the best places i have discovered  mainly because i dont like tomatoes  and z is not totally about tomatoes either  there are so many items on their menu i have not been disappointed with  from pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad   all of them tomato free   the best feature though i have to say is their insanely easy to use online ordering  being in the user experience industry  im frustrated with online ordering 95  of the time  z makes me happy though  i actually sometimes miss them if i dont order occasionally  you can customize any item with almost anything you can think of and its very easy to walk through  they also let you know up front if you are too far away for their delivery services so you dont sign up anyway   i love you  i love you  i love you  and your use of fun ingredients like bacon and pine nuts and mushrooms   
fiesta burrito is pretty close to my office and a few months ago one of my coworkers introduced it to me for a first time  for a quick in and out mexican place its definitely worth it  the prices are decent  they have a fairly extensive menu  and the service is fast    the downsides   1  parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today  2  seating can sometimes be limited as well  its a fairly small joint  3  being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesnt leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time   with that being said  its definitely worth trying if you are in the area  i suggest the carne asada burrito   
eh  just further proves i really am not a chain type of person    swung in here over the weekend with a friend hoping to score some sheet music  not entire volumes of collections  for the guitar and maybe the piano and have a guitar restrung    store seemed small and cramped and the music selection leaves everything to be desired  it was sad  there were no individual songs and even the amount of books was small also   on the plus side  everyone was nice  and they did restring the guitar while we grabbed some food  however  i still prefer my small local music stores 
okay lux  i can move you up a star  im still not a fan that most of the time its hard to find a seat and have it be quiet enough to focus on anything  additionally  i am sad that my favorite shoe chair that was an important part of an evening i had with tony a  seems to no longer be there   however  when i came back this past saturday for a velvet with your homemade whipped cream  you truly delivered  it was the perfect temperature and a million times better than the last one i remembered  bravo  now move closer to my house and well be all set 
i am trying not to let the bad press or a friends huge fan love sway my review  therefore  this breakfast joint is middle of the road  when a friend first mentioned heading here for lunch  i was curious  and after reading reviews  i was scared  but i trust said friend  and allowed myself to be led in blindly to another two hippies joint    here are items that were factored into this 3 star rating      first and foremost  i didnt love it  but i most certainly didnt hate it either  if someone wanted to go back  i would agree  there are a few more things on the menu that intrigue me enough to want to try them      i didnt like the decor as much as their pizza joint  it was too much on the stoner side of hippie   to a nauseating degree  then there was this random old stove that didnt scream hippie at all  i personally prefer happy hippie  oooh now theres an awesome alliteration  and another  bam      the green chile burger i got was pretty damn good  i wish the heat was kicked up a few notches  but it was solid  i was so pleased i nearly swallowed that thing whole      they have the lemonade i love  i tried mango this time  not as good as blood orange  but still solid      i did not find the breakfast menu so appealing i wanted it instead of lunch  this was a disappointment  i also heard they dont serve breakfast all day  though one of the people i was dining with did get breakfast  i think we were there around 1pm if i remember correctly      the fries were terrible  i love crinkle fries but these were so dry i was unable to enjoy them  fries arent supposed to be healthy  give me the grease  even adding sauce to them  i tried sriracha  did no good  i will never have fries there again 
this place has such great potential  the drink menu is pretty decent and they have some creative pizzas  i always end up getting the mushroom party  which is exactly as awesome as it sounds  the dessert is to die for too  give me a red velvet cupcake and i will swoon   three things keep me from coming back here more often  1  its rather small and cramped 2  the service has been slow every time ive been there 3  parking is practically nonexistent
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   not another beauty and no brains personality  those completely disgust me  but alas  its true  so true  im not sure anyone can hype this enough for me to try it again    people said it was fantastic  the menu looked amazing  i had decided it was dessert for lunch day  and i was anticipating the banana bread pudding and doing all i could not to think about it until lunch time arrived    let me tell you this place has all the beauty  the decor and feel is sexy and sophisticated  the end   upon arriving some of the items we anticipated were not available  including the wine i wanted and the dessert i had chosen as sacrifice for friday lunch    to be quite honest  i dont even remember what i had  just that it was a terrible salad that is easy to forget  what i do remember though  is our food taking forever to arrive  dirty silverware  a haphazard server  the wrong dessert being served when we did order some to share  no banana bread pudding and a french onion soup that looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for three days before it was served    at least there was an entertaining table of hungover college teenie boppers to entertain us  that and most of it was covered with a groupon 
this review is being occasionally brought to you by showcase mazda service lobby wifi  kinda  because it took 20 minutes for it to work  but we seem to be okay now  hopefully i can get through this   now that i have that off my chest i have to say im confused  why  because  according to yelp  the mazda dealership near 16th st   camelback brands its service department under a completely different name  but i have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings i receive  its always been camelback mazda  alas  i am getting service  so i guess this is the company i need to file it under   after being here a few times  i have to say its pretty much so so  the first time i was here  i had an amazing experience with the service department  iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on  i hate when mechanics and service staff just assume im gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue  its crazy  he also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected  which i truly appreciate  granted it was a horrid orange subaru wagon  suv thing that was so not my mazda  but it worked   this time  im a little less optimistic  the time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare  i sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that shouldve been in my record and on my appointment  like wtf im getting done   other mazda dealerships ive been to have had that ready when i got there  i just review sign  and go hop to my coworking  the end  get with it  it took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there  maybe i should get here 20 minutes early next time    however  the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic  i always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things  like yelp reviews  theres a tv  some couches  high tables to sit and work at  wifi  popcorn  coffee  soda  and slushies  oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking  i uploaded it so you dont miss out   overall not too bad  but time will tell how consistent the check in procedure is 
meh truly is the best rating for my experience at pasta brioni    i ended up there on the last day of yelp eats with a group of friends in a craving for italian  from what i saw on their menu  i was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things  i walked out not that excited    the ambiance inside is very nice  though a bit on the dark side  the decor inside told a completely different story than what i was thinking when i saw the entrance  it is very posh inside and i did like the comfy booths   we arrived early enough to get the early bird special  which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one  i wonder if this was truly our best choice    for me when it comes to pasta  i am a bit picky  this mainly comes from the fact that i dont like really heavy sauces and i really do not like tomatoes  it has to be a good italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited   my first course was a caesar salad  wait take that back  that was supposed to be my first course  i believe i really got romaine lettuce  croutons and dressing of the day  it definitely was  not  caesar  this left me sad  the bread with it though was pretty damn good although i suggest bigger bottles of balsamic  we ran out fast    my main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne  the penne came with a paste  note i did not say sauce  and seemed a little dry and bland  the chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular    dessert involved two mini cannolis  like the pasta  they seemed a little dry and lacking  but were flavorful    overall my meal was really just okay  the service was also nothing outstanding either  including someone having to ask for water on several occasions 
extensive menu   the interior is perfection  its cosy  stylish and the perfect spot to take that one friend who is always on the trend   i only went in for a dessert and it was lovely that we werent rushed out by the staff  i tried the dulce de leche cheesecake which as incredible and you have to do it    id love to go back for lunch and try a sandwich of their extensive menu  would strongly recommend 
thaiphon is this great little shop on union   really close to mcgill university   the service is very fast and the owners are very friendly  the menu variety is wide  ive had a few things on the menu and they have all been absolutely delicious  it may not be the best thai food in montreal but its pretty great when youre craving something spicy 
cacao 70 is perfect when youre craving a sweet treat  their menu is pretty standard and youll be pleased with most of it  i wouldnt say its the type of dessert you dream of indulging into but it hits the spot    my warning is go in wanting to spend some quality time with someone because the service is so slow  they usually have 2 people waiting their big restaurant on busy nights and they really struggle to keep up    my favourites are their strawberry shortcake and their banana split 
nice place to go to for asian cuisine  i would recommend their vietnamese spring roll   it comes with a warm peanut sauce that is really great  they had a decent array of vegetarian options which is always delightful    the service was actually great   maybe we went on a down time but i was surprised to read other reviews saying it was bad  the waitress was really friendly and gave good recommendations    the ambience is nice  the location is charming  the food is average at best but much nicer than your typical asian cuisine joint 
the burgers here were average  i tried the veggie burger and found the consistency to be a little too soft and quite difficult to eat with how highly piled the other toppings were  then saving grace were the fiery peppers and sauce that came in my burger and really added the flavour  my tablemate enjoyed the beef burger with wild mushrooms but also felt that it was nothing special  the service was fantastic and all of the staff was extremely friendly  i wouldnt go out of my way to go again but maybe if im around crescent id pop in 
i had a really fantastic experience with mdexs dental services  went in for a simple check up and cleaning which was great from start to finish  their clinics registration system is all on a computer which is really cool and smooth to use  the service is polite and professional and there was great soothing music playing throughout the treatment  they were quick and clean and im looking forward to going back  as much as one does to see a dentist      shout out to the great receptionists who helped me with my insurance paperwork and were really fun to chat with as i waited 
just went here   i would rate this place 0 stars if i could   when i pulled up  the guy asked the year of my car and immediately told me whatever he needs to check mine was broken   sorry   he couldnt even direct me to the nearest smog check    vehicle registration place   not even another jiffy smog   when i did make it to another one  they were already closed because apparently they do  last checks  at 5 45    which this guy also failed to mention before i went driving halfway across town  again   if your car is older  do yourself a favor and dont bother coming here 
i am so glad i found this shop   i put off taking my 93 miata in for a very overdue oil change after moving here in february because i was new in town and didnt know who i could trust   thankfully  some people at my workplace recommended this shop  and im a very satisfied customer   i was very worried about a problem with my a  c during the hot months  and was bracing myself for an a  c compressor replacement  easily a  1 000 repair   and here it was a little leaky seal   that was it   the pricing was so low i nearly fell out of my chair when they told me   really appreciate this shop  and will continue to take my baby car to them for all my mechanical needs 
do not expect good customer service  they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks        but what they lack in service they make up for in delicious food  expect long waits  order ahead    make them repeat your order  pick up or dine in  but not delivery  ive going for years and only once was i given a smile at the decatur and sahara location   she made our day and got a nice tip   
ive flown in and out of sky harbor many times  its a pretty well laid out airport  and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area    i was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1 5 hour layover  ate at a typical tex mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs  quite tasty and i like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas    its a big and busy airport  but navigating it is very straight forward  if im heading out west  this is an airport that i dont mind hanging in if i have to have a layover  it features free wi fi that seemed to work wherever i went  the airport and its bathrooms are very clean and well maintained    a word to the wise  if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices  youre better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area  they are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it  so i usually go into a restaurant  scope out an outlet near a table or a booth  sit down and use that  of course  just to be courteous  ill order something to eat to make it fair  i havent had to go through the tsa checkpoint since i only land there to connect elsewhere  so i cant comment on that fun experience 
hands down the best mediterranean food in tempe  if not the valley   super flavorful and authentic  plus the employees are very friendly and helpful  the eggplant and falafel are my favorite things there  all of the hummus is delicious  so many options to choose from 
from what i could see  they have cute clothes and a great selection of mommy products  but their customer service is lacking  one time i went in  i was never acknowledged and the ladies sat behind the counter gossiping about another coworker  the other time  i asked about a shirt that was missing buttons and was told it couldnt be marked down  even though there werent other intact ones available   the shirt was around  35  too much to pay for something id have to fix   ill try not to have to visit this shop again 
yummy  recommended   fried chicken and bulgogi ramen  lil spicy but not that much  long lined but worth for waiting  quick and good service 
i came here with a friend around 7 00 on a lovely summer evening    w burger bar was a pretty good venue for us  it is clean and well maintained  it has a pretty fun ambience and lots of tvs if you want to catch up on the latest sports game    one thing that i didnt like was that the music was very loud  which made it difficult for us to hear each other and we often had to ask the other to repeat what was just said    one aspect that i really liked  and appreciated  was the cheap drink menu  they have drink specials for each day of the week  friday was a long island iced tea for  6 99   they also offer  2 shooters  pretty hard to resist if youre looking to have a good time   my friend ordered the potato skins and i had the house salad  both were decent  neither particularly stood out  but given the name burger bar its not fair to judge them on dishes that arent part of their namesake service was friendly and attentive   ill return for sure  and will definitely have to try out those  2 shooters at some point 
came here for dinner using a groupon   10 groupon for  20 worth of food  i think    we ordered one of their trios of appetizers as a starter   the bean  grain salad  the beets  and the kale hummus  the beets were delicious  perfectly cooked   not too hard or too mushy  the beans    grains dish has a bit of an indian curry flavour to it  so caution if you dont like that taste  i personally didnt like the kale hummus  i found it to be too bitter tasting  but my dining companion really liked it  i ordered the mixed greens salad and some of the baby greens were wilty  the pasta was a quite a large serving  more than enough to take home leftovers and have a full meal the next day   there isnt much ambiance to this place  it kind of looks like an old run down bar that theyve converted into a restaurant  on the plus side  they do accept american express    they have lots of options for people with all sorts of tastes and the menu is well labeled with dietary options for any type of diet  another word of advice   the menu in house is slightly different than the one online  its not drastically different  but im sure if you saw something online that wasnt on the actual menu  then you could probably ask to see if they would make it for you
i found this place from a friend who wanted to try out a new shop  after seeing the results from his tattoo i was impressed  i wanted to try this shop out  i went to get my chest tattood and went to numerous places at first and the pricing was ridiculous  i went here and i was hooked  i love this place  the environment is awesome    the people that work there are ultra awesome   josh adams is my tattoo artist    hes legit  he does any artwork i throw at him and he does an amazing job  buddy is rad too  he did one of my co workers tattoo and it turned out perfect  if your a tourist  this is the place to go if you want local pricing and a safe sterile space  if your a local then you know whats best for you  and coming down to one of the best shop in vegas is your only resort  downtown tattoo  bam  
free video games ranging from classic to current  plus amazing tribute themed cocktails   amazing food  i sure hope this place sticks around for a while  its magical 
love this place  excellent food  great crew  great atmosphere  chicken and waffles in charlotte  may they never close 
downtowners  yes  you have all the late night fun  yes  you get the sports teams  yah  you get the concerts and big events  the tiff and caribanna  ya  you have that too     but surburbians  we have dim sum  dim sum i say  and nobody can ever take that away from us    people regularly tell me that rol san is one of the better dim sum joints downtown  if it is  i pity the downtowners  for  3    5 for a plate  you get very average quality dim sum  not bad  but not great  and certainly not near the value youd get uptown  and value is a very important aspect of dim sum  ask any chinese person     i suppose itll do if im craving some har gow and milk tarts  but ill stick to my uptown faves 
ngfw    sometimes you want a coffee shop to grab a quick brew  a morning snack  or a quick bite  and often for me  i just need a place to just sit down and do some work on my lappy   and the most important thing in these instances is the internet    while this is your standard country style location  if you just want to grab a coffee  a donut or a sandwich itll do just fine  but the internet here is horrendous  the advertise it as hassle free  but its too slow to do anything  google itself will barely load  so with persistent internet issues  i must deem this place not good for work  ngfw     if you need a wifi connection  go to starbucks 100m down the street 
after reading the reviews  i had to try this  legendary  apple cake    the owner is friendly as people say  we started chatting about random things and hes nothing if not friendly   served room temp  he didnt have a warm batch in the oven   i was pretty excited to try this  as apple desserts  pie  crumble  cake  you name it  are a favorite of mine    the cake was moist  tasty and had a great texture  id love if the top were a tad crisper on top  like a dutch apple cake  pie is   but overall it was a good cake    i wouldnt tag it  legendary  as other seems to have  but its quite good  id love to come in the morning to try one warm and fresh out of the oven   a slice is  2 50  half a cake  6 slices  is  8 99 
i love to find a locally own restaurant  nothing beats it  the owners of this delightful cafe are friendly and kind  as well as great cooks  the food is amazing  i have loved everything ive had there  from the quiche to the soup to the delicious lemonades  and for a treat  the scones   highly recommended 
bad food  bad drinks  bad atmosphere    very dark space  doesnt seem cleanly  did not have a good experience
four stars  why  because this store is not in closer proximity for me  insert laughing emoji please   pleasant workers wry time i stroll in  they push those samples on you  clearly  in a good way    clean  clean  clean set up for the samples   no double dipping those fingers  samples are covered in their acrylic boxes which double as displays   all are provided with small tongs right above  genius   why cant there have that  i ask myself that every time in in here  each scrumptious   fresh pineapple shaped cookie is individually wrapped   my favorite  yes i always help myself for those samples mentioned earlier   no  i wont disclose how many ive consumed   ok  just a few  yes  less than a handful   alright  multiply that and im an expert taster  that being said  i can assure you all varieties are worth purchasing and going home with  double up on my favorite  dark chocolate guava 
my mothers clothes dryer stopped becoming hot  not even warm   she called one repair man  no success   did a search here on yelp and came across bill    goods appliance repair   bill answered immediately and came to the rescue within hours of contacting him   needless to say  the entire dryer was apart in no time and he completed the job my putting everything back and cleaning up   thank you bill for a fantastic job  outstanding workmanship   professionalism   bill has the expertise   stands behind his skills   wonderful experience and job well done  will be contacting him again when needed   also  will recommend him for others and not just here on yelp    shes a senior and she mentioned  he likes seniors ha 
our waiter made some suggestions and we went ahead and ordered them  not disappointed   enjoyed everything and the sushi was fresh as always 
i usually come in twice a year   chain places have never been my thing  unless its those golden arches and i need those fries     its busy  but doesnt mean its a    ive been seated in the patio  at a table inside or at the bar   service is always mediocre  as well as the food   thats all i can really write about it  its simply just there  as for this location in town square  i gravitate more towards that whiskey place across the way  
when i do have the wild hair for feeling crafty i find myself perusing hobby lobby   what by all means was intended as a quick get in and out i always find myself there for at least an hour  okay  more of a two hour perusing    the ideas and juices start flowing   the one project clearly turns into a few projects  because this store is merchandised well  employees always restocking and available for questions     the aisles are always stocked  neat  tidy and clean    tip  google hobby lobby for that 40  off one regular item   
this is the only salon i will go to in the valley for waxing  i found jfy about 2 years ago and have been a fan ever since  i always make sure to see heather  although im sure all the girls are great   she is a fantastic esthetician and i am always so impressed with her work  ive never had a brow wax like the ones i get from her  the braz you can get here is amazing as well  totally worth it  they explain everything really well and make sure that you are comfortable  they pride themselves on a  no double dipping  rule and that is something i appreciate  the customer service is fantastic  loretta  the owner  is always quick to get me on the schedule as i am typically guilty of needing a last minute appointment  i would highly recommend jfy and plan to be a loyal customer for a long time 
you cant hit the snooze button on a saturday if you want to avoid a lengthy wait  as long as we arrive early in the morning  im all about this place  the service is great  the coffee flows freely  and the food is on point  because carbs run the world  i usually go with the spuds deluxe  one day  i hope to venture out and try something new  cute patio when the weather is nice 
this farmers market is a little sparse in the summer months and rightfully so  there does not seem to an abundance of produce when its consistently 110 degrees outside  however  fall through spring is perfection and i love spending my saturday mornings here  wonderful vendors  fantastic products and a great way to experience old town scottsdale 
pitta souvli is without a doubt my favorite greek restaurant in the valley  it is locally owned  has fantastic customer service and the food is amazing  i am a vegetarian and this place always has delicious options for me  however  pre vegetarian days were filled with their tuna salad which is out of this world    dont miss out on an order of the greek fries when you visit 
ive been a customer of blancos for quite a while now  its a go to place for girls night or a quick bite with my hubby  unfortunately  blanco has lost both my husband and i as patrons   on a recent saturday night  we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria  after we had learned our lesson on weekends past  my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes  no big deal and nothing we didnt expect    an hour after our call in time  and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes  i approached the hostess asking where we were on the list  she informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table  half an hour after that  no table  i politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped  marked off the list and forgotten  the hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes  when i went to sit back down  the couple sitting next to us were seated  infuriated  we both decided it was time to leave  my husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights  they said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right    i find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable  we were patient  understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant  in return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table  on the plus side  we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now  thanks for the help  blanco 
i have so far been very impressed with this office  the girls at the front desk are very nice and also interact with the patients  ie  x rays  which i appreciate  usually it is not fun to be passed off from person to person in a doctors office   their skill set makes it so you are comfortable with the people youre working with and eliminates feeling as though youre in a pinball machine  bouncing from here to there     dr  saunders is clearly knowledgeable in his field and has really eased any worries i had about my foot injury  he is patient and thorough in his explanations  this office also does in house x rays and short notice appointments which is helpful considering most people dont plan to break their toes 4 6 weeks out    i certainly hope i dont have to frequent this office after im all healed up but if i do happen to sustain another foot fancy injury  i will be sure to see dr  saunders 
yeah  its a little overpriced for burgers but it is not out of the norm compared to other joints like this ie  coal burger  modern burger  etc     we have eaten here two times  both times i ordered the zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli  both times it was great  i will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food  one order is enough to split between two people  the milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to biltmore   definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend  other than watching others get to eat before you  i have no complaints  good service  good food  good restaurant 
its a little scary when youve reached the point with your vehicle that you cant justify taking it to the dealership anymore for service  i love my honda dealership but couldnt justify driving 30 miles and spending exponentially more money there than a normal shop    a family referral brought me to the door of marshalls and i have had two good experiences so far  both times i brought my car here were normal maintenance appointments so i cant speak to huge repairs or their costs  i can tell you that both times  my oil changes were done within a couple of hours  the final price was reasonable and customer service is overall pretty good  ive never felt i was being taken advantage of or that my patronage hasnt been valued  car talk can be a daunting task for a this lady and im glad to have found this little safe and reliable gem in scottsdale 
 s gratis chips   salsa   ask them for their habanero salsa if you are a spicy food fan  marco polo taco   shrimp   bacon    yum  pork shank appetizer   perfectly cooked  lightly sweet  soooo good   service   always great   s prices   i think the prices are high but at least the food is consistently good
this new location is great  the space is much much larger and they are able to produce more beer to meet the growing demand  this spot is easy to access and there is plenty of parking  come check it out 
classroom central is an awesome organization helping students in underprivileged schools get school supplies they desperately need  every employee and volunteer at classroom central is really passionate about what they do  risa g   the volunteer coordinator  is great to work with  i highly recommend donating school supplies or volunteering time at classroom central  you can trade six hours of volunteer time  3 hours for current teachers  for one teacher shopping day 
great local beer shop that has truly turned into something amazing  after their expansion  they added seating and multiple taps  check this spot out and take something awesome home 
i have such a weakness for j  crew  they quality makes the premium price worth it  students and teachers  make sure to show your id for an extra discount 
no no no    the service was terrible  we walked in at 9 00pm on a saturday night after having dinner across the street  i had to check the hours on the door to make sure they were open as the employee was too busy with closing duties to greet us  she didnt even acknowledge us  that was a bit off putting but i still wanted fro yo  i looked around for some tasting cups but didnt find any  i asked the employee  that was busy putting paper towels down on the drip trays on all the fro yo machines  for them  she grudgingly walked behind the counter to get us some  ok    fine    she made it really clear that we were not welcome there  i still took my sample cups and started to pull the levers to try some flavors  to my surprise  the frozen yogurt was far from frozen  they were just a big  melted mess  spurting a partially frozen  sticky slurry on my hands  that might have explained all the flashing red lights on the machines  i asked the employee why they were like that  she answered  with no shortage of attitude  that it was really slow and that was why they were like that  she offered no solution  that was the last straw  i left without making a purchase  i had no desire to spend my money at a place where i didnt feel welcome  i really dont need employees rolling their eyes at me  there are lots of other fro yo spots that are much more pleasant  needless to say  i will not be returning to this location 
fantastic new location with something for everyone  regardless of your climbing expertise  youll find something here    the staff is friendly and helpful  the other climbers could become your new best friends  i highly recommend getting a membership and having unlimited access to this awesome facility 
awful  like many other yelpers said plan to spend the entire day here  the employees are less than pleasant to deal with  consider finding a different location     helpful hints      cash or check only  no atm on site    they only process drivers licenses at this location  no vehicle registrations are processed here 
the winter olympics inspired us to hit the ice rink  im no michelle kwan but ive been on the ice a time or two  this rink just didnt blow my mind    we arrived right when the open skate time started  check their website for the schedule   the entry process is pretty simple  walk to the building  pay your money   10 for admission and skate rental  and grab your rental skates at the next window    the negatives    i was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates  the surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing  the rental skates were extremely dull  yes  i know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge  i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink  this would have provided better separation for general skaters  the people that just want to skate circles  from the more experienced  technical skaters  the people that want to spin and jump   ive been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters  it would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette    there were also a few times that i found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction     the positives    they serve beer and wine   if it wasnt so early in the day  i would have partaken  the employees that i interacted with seemed friendly enough    pineville ice house doesnt have a lot of competition  which means they really dont need to change much to stay in business  if you live in charlotte and you want to go ice skating this will probably be where you head 
ulta is the big box equivalent of a specialty cosmetic store  their selection includes  prestige  brands like benefit and normal brands like revlon  this store also has a salon  my biggest complaint about ulta is the customer service  i prefer going to sephora for my specialty cosmetics 
overall  fancy italian in south end with high prices but underwhelming food    valet   check white tablecloths   check  extensive wine list   check pricey entrees   check flavorful  quality food         i was very underwhelmed with the food  especially considering how high the prices were  i had the gnocchi   18   wedge salad  and tried the veal osso bucco   29   given the high reviews and prices  i expected the food to be better  it was all fine  but we could have gotten a better meal for half the price that i would have been happier with elsewhere    save this place for date nights where food isnt the highlight of the evening 
shut up and take my money  love whole foods so much  hate the chunk it takes out of my wallet   where else can you pick up a pint of craft beer and shop for the greatest organic  local  gluten free  nut free finds 
overall  deejai noodle bar in noda is putting out some interesting dishes in a cool space  but nothing about it knocked my socks off   pros  interesting noodle dishes  i had the salmon curry  tasty but i wouldnt get it again  the salmon was cooked perfectly but the thin rice noodles and thick curry sauce didnt work for me  the kimchi poke bowl was tasty  id get that again    cons  the parking lot is weird to get in and out of  save yourself the headache and park around the building  service was fine but nothing to write home about    glad to see the ethnic cuisine scene in charlotte expanding  ill definitely give them another shot 
finally a place in goodyear that knows how to make a good cappuccino   my breakfast burrito was tasty also 
this place is good  but not great   i liked the outside patio and the burger was tasty  but they messed up our order and we had to wait a while before they got it right   the burger was tasty and seasoned well but the fries and onion rings were mediocre   i am glad we stopped in to try it  but i wont go out of my way to go back 
i have two dogs   one dog is 9 years old and has been to the vet for his usual shots and a couple of minor things over the last 9 years   my other  dog is 3 years old and since we got him from the pound 2 years ago he has been to the vet on average once every 4 months   you can liken my dogs to a toyota that only needs the oil changed and a ford that breaks down constantly   del lago has been there for all of my routine vet needs and the various other minor emergencies my youngest dog has endured   the problem child had to have surgery to remove a lump and the doctors at del lago let us bring him in as often as we wanted to have the wound cleaned and wrapped  with no charge   it is those little things that make it obvious they really care about our pets   they can handle all of your regular vet needs with care and compassion   they also understand if you bring in your dog and say  well  he may just have a stomach ache or he may have swallowed my flash drive   they treat each case with seriousness and give our dogs the best care we have found 
this place is nothing special   the food was good  but not great   the service was fast and friendly  but again the food was nothing worth going back for   i dont even remember what it is that i ate  so that in itself should tell you something about the place   or does that tell you something about me   yes  i am getting old  but i can remember when something is worth having again 
bought the groupon deal and now understand why they have the groupon  the salad bar had empty plates and no one was refilling  the items on there were cold cut and pickles  nothing looked appetizing  soup pot was placed on a table next to salad bar  we drank ice teas instead of the wine the coupon came with but was charged for two ice teas  service taxes  groupon fee   after buying the coupon and paying for all the fees   90  it should have gone the fogo or texas de brazil    all the people that gave this place a low rating  well theyre true 
i grew up in cali  i know no other burger joints but in and out  fatburher and tommys  what else is there to know 
i thought i would give this place another try and its still disappointing  service was starting off very well  until i informed them of the broken piece of glass i bit inside their sticky rice  they stopped making eye contact and coming around the table    ordered  papaya salad  they used bottled lemon juice which is wierd  left a bad taste  chicken bbq  4 pieces of dried up chicken and you can tell the chicken was precooked and old  pork rib bbq dinner  fried rice was sweeter than usual and the ribs again was precooked  you will know by the way the bones are bone dry  tom ka gai  flavor was good but the chicken was slimy so we stopped eating it   sticky rice   typical  microwaved and the pieces of glass as a treat   so after they were told of the pieces of glass  they offered to give me a new one  which i refused and then they just disappeared  they did remove  2 off my bill 
this business is closed  drove over here to find out they are no longer in business  was really looking forward to see what they had to offer 
the nail tech i had was great and its actually best gel ive had  i wouldve given another star if it wasnt for their false check in ad of 10     to redeem the 10  off for check in the require you to do a review before they honor the 10   whos going to do a proper review while standing at the counter 
the last time i came here was 5 years ago and i found an ant in my sauce  no apology from anyone and still had to pay for my food  so i tried it again tonight and no joke there was hair in our food  sent it back and they replaced it  but why would i want to eat the same thing that had hair in it  again no apology  does this happen all the time there that it just rolls off their backs    so i have given it a second try and will never come back 
always great people watching  martinis and of course caviar  when you need some adult time with a bit of pretentious high class feel come here  piano playing in the background high priced drinks  a variety of salty snacks to keep you thirsty and the option for caviar this is the place    im not going to lie and say i paid for my drinks or pricey snacks  its the perks that comes along with my job so i have no choice but to enjoy it  hahahaa 
i went here twice first time we ordered maxs chicken which was good  kare kare  all soup no meat and bland  palabok  also bland  calamari  its fried so it was good and garlic fried rice  ok  not the best food ive had and thought i should try it again  maybe itll be better  tried for the second time  ordered sinigang  sisig  max chicken  well it was all terrible except for the chicken  sisig was soggy  sinigang was tasteless  the service as usually in this place was horrible and very rude  people here are not accommodating and act oblivious to everything wrong with the place 
veggie nation is located in down town las vegas on carson st  there is parking on the street  but you have to pay for it  this place is one of the best vegan restaurants that i have been to  i would recommend this place even if your not a vegan  everything here was excellent   we started out with some fair trade organic coffee  it was served in a manual coffee press that contained about four cups  i also liked that they had almond milk and raw stevia for my coffee   appetizers bao bun and save the tuna roll     the bao bun contained some tofu  spinach  mushrooms  and an amazing sauce  excellent       save the tuna is a roll that is made with veggies and purple rice  excellent     entrees   veggie nation burger   excellent  muchas gracias    quesada   excellent  ellen degeneres   three veggie tacos  the shells consisted of collar green leaves  excellent   the total bill was  72 00 for 4 entrees  3 apps  and coffee  it is reasonably priced and well worth the money and the drive 
8  2014 update on my review      it has been almost one year since i have moved in  there have been a few maintenance issues and i have no complaints whatsoever about how they handled the repairs    garbage disposal broke replaced in a timely manor    dishwasher broke ordered a new dishwasher and replaced the broken one    there were a few minor repairs that were addressed in a timely manor also   so far  so good   ill update the review after the move out 
this place is okay  i go here for chinese food  they have good beef and chicken dishes  the lobster and noodles was pretty good  the sizzling rice soup is not great  i have had much better  the rice is not crispy enough 
this place is located in a strip mall on durango just north of flamingo  when you walk in you notice right away all the memorabilia on the walls from chicago   the food was okay  i had the italian beef sandwich  it was definitely not made like als italian beef in chicago 
i ordered my wheels from discount tires  i got the same price as most other places  it wasnt that great of a deal  it took me three weeks to get them because the manufacturer sent the wrong wheels twice  one the correct wheels arrived they installed them in a timely manner and i am happy with my purchase 
the hands down  absolute best fast food burgers anywhere  i dont want to hear about in   out either  they are good  but nothing is better than fat burger   fatburger offers you different size burgers  the xxl is way more than i should eat  but i eat it anyways  the toppings  the meat  and the fries are all much better than any other fast food place out there   the staff is very friendly at this location and they are open late  nothing compares to a fatburger  
this is an excellent practice facility  a little out of the way if you live in summerlin though  they have sand traps  putting greens  and two levels to tee off from at their driving range  they also have a driving range where you can hit off the grass  they have lights on their par 3 course  so you can play at night  i prefer angel park if i play at night though  nice pro shop 
they have no competition in this area so maybe thats why they can cut corners  to get more authentic vietnamese  have to make the haul to chinatown  disappointing pho and broken rice dishes  i would compare this place to an average chinese restaurant  and thats not good 
im reviewing the roast pork sandwich  great bread  tasty and moist pork  sharp provalone and broccoli rabe make for a delicious combo  i only wish i had ordered the 10 inch rather than the 6 inch  definitely would get that again and wanna try the numerous other sandwiches available 
yes yes yes  3 tacos  5 bucks  the best was the carne asada  great quality and flavor  barbacoa was juicy and tender as it should be  i missed a bit of pineapple on the al pastor  for a quick bite or to go  hard to beat 
i posted on facebook suggestions for lunch in the north hills and someone recommended this place to me   it looked like it had easy enough access for me  so i decided to check it out   i was craving a healthy but salty  oxymoron  right   salad but changed my mind when i checked out the menu   its an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from   you pay  sit  and they bring your food to you   it is byo which is nice but not traditional as the place doesnt really seem to  fit  a byo restaurant in the vibe or menu  its a deli essentially    i ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so i figured it would be good   i also ordered the motmot wrap which had turkey  bacon  some tomato aioli    i also got a foundtain drink   it ended up at about  15 which seemed a little high for a lunch   the service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch     the  side order  of mac and cheese   it was really good and could be a meal in itself   the bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy   the noodles were slightly overcooked which i do not prefer in  mac and cheese but the star of the dish was  of course  the cheese   thick cheese sauce that i knew was hearty after three bites   very cheddary  not too sharp   it was more like a glue than a sauce   the wrap came with chips and was served warm which i was not expecting   too much aioli  this is common at restaurants anywhere  but i dont think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing  especially since this was nothing special   the turkey was nice and thinly sliced   the bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon   the turkey was fresh   i only had a few chips   i couldnt tell if they were house made or otherwise     i went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more   outside of the noodles being overcooked  that dish is really something special     i would go back to try something else  just not a wrap because i think for the cost its lacking in execution and flavor 
i honestly do love trader joes because of the variety of people that patronize and work there   i think the prices are decent  and since i am a vegetarian and try to live a healthy lifestyle  i generally am happy with trader joes   i wish it actually provided most of the things you need for everyday life  because we all know chocolate covered toffee isnt a necessity    other than that i am happy 
kind of greasy  but its a unique diner style restaurant   i enjoy it for fish sandwiches and mac n cheese 
very good  i cant believe we found a good place to go downtown  its a bit small but it adds to its charm  love the cucumber water  and all the food we had was great  if you want something competly different in phoenix then come check this place out 
really good place if you are looking for something different and are going with people who want the same old thing  they have the classics like spaghetti and meatballs and some creative dishes  i got a pasta with prosciutto and brussels sprouts and it was really good    make sure you get there early cause its kinda small dining area and fills up fast  but worth the wait 
i did a 30 day trail here just looking for something to kickstart me into a fitness routine  i was a really good experience  by the time my trial was up i knew about 5 people that were doing trials too just based off of what we said  it is a very intense 90min  and sometimes while in there you think  why am i doing this  but you are always glad you came because you do feel refreshed  the instructors are all pretty great and they can play some cool music sometimes 
i like cousins  its better than subway  but lets face it  almost anything is  ill admit that the place doesnt look the be the cleanest  just like the other reviews said  but i didnt really have any problems with the service  but overall it is pretty forgettable  the only reason we went in is because we had a coupon and it was right down the street from our house  its the first time we have been there since moving two years ago  and even though the sub was ok  i dont see myself going back for maybe another two years 
this business is solid  these people are friendly  fast and efficient  overall  great experience 
my wife and i love coming to this location  its definitely more homey feeling than their other locations and other doctors offices in general  each midwife is so kind and personable and theyve given us the best experience time after time 
my wife and i love sprouts and now we have one within 10 minutes of us  we went today for the grand opening and everyone was so friendly  its beautiful inside and if youre looking for a healthier lifestyle  go to sprouts 
this is my absolute favorite frys  it just opened and everything is so fresh  clean  and the staff is amazing  matt rich in the beer and wine bar is fantastic and so personable  cathy in floral was so helpful  my wifes sandal broke and she fixed it lol  we didnt even buy something and she was so helpful  this is right by our house and right across the street from sprouts  great job team  keep it up please 
i am here for a conference stayed one night and am looking for another hotel   rooms are nice  bed is very comfortable  but they are nothing special  no in room coffee maker     the staff is another story   so far they have been unhelpful and some down right rude  when i drove up there were several bell man  but no one came to help me   i had to go to the bell desk and ask for help    i should add that i have a broken ankle and leg in a boot  during check in i specifically asked for a room with a view   i was given a room with a view of the front roof  i could seriously only see the roof of the front overhand   i called down to change rooms and no one answered the phone ever  i had to walk back down to the lobby   when i changed rooms i left something back in the other room and needed to have security let me in   he was so rude it was shocking   i said something apologizing for the inconvenience and he literally turned his head and did not say one word  i repeated myself b  c i thought he must not have heard me and he did the same thing   no smile  no thats okay maam  nothing  no handicap accessible self parking  self parking garage was full due to a prom at the hotel and several hundred yards away  very disappointed 
dinner at lucas kitchen  wow what can i say  other than bellisimo  new menu that just started this week  great servers  who explain a little history about luca and his background and his philosophy on cooking   we started out with the calamari  which is one of our favorites from the old menu   its done with a light crisp coating and drizzled in jalapeno honey  we than had the arrancini alla sicilian which was a  beautiful rice ball in a cream sauce  we also had the most wonderful polenta fries with a incredible garlic aioli    for our main course i ordered the bistecca alla don corleone  which was  a grilled rib eye topped with breadcrumbs  capers  anchovies  herbed red wine roasted tomatoes perfect grilled steak  medium rare that was so tasty   my husband had the ravioli caprese  stuffed with ricotta cheese  san marzano cherry tomatoes  fresh basil sauce  both the steak and ravioli had the most delicious tiny tiny cherry tomatoes pan sauteed on the top of them    other family had the lasagna and the fettuccine which were both very italian and very delicious  for dessert i had the pannacotta which was topped with a bruleed slice of orange   incredible   and blueberries   everyone enjoyed their dinner immensely  the service and the food were just so delicious  this new menu is a keeper  i love the ability to have a large or small plate to share or to keep to myself   i would eat there every night if i could    please go see chef luca and his wife jessica 
went to one of our fav restaurants again last night  but i have a bone to pick with the chef  we had a party of 3 our bill ws over 100 00  my daughter is 9 months pregnant   due tomorrow   she ordered the new  south  burger for her entree   asking to hold the bacon because of nitrates    we asked if there was any way she could have some fried pickles on the burger  we were willing to pay extra for them    the waitress was hesistant  but the chef said  absolutely  not   explain this one    he has fried pickles back there   they have a frickle burger which is a burger with fried pickles   but he would not  not even for a pregnant woman who offered to pay for the extra ingredient add the fried pickles    did i say pickles  and she is pregnant   wth     
pizza bar in waxhaw     if any of you are imports from other cities  you know that pizza is lacking down south  well friend   go to the harris teeter in waxhaw and try the pizza  it is rolled out fresh everyday  cooked to order and those girls will bend over backwards to make it just how you like it   shallon and shannon and gina  they are the best pizza makers in all the harris teeters   the ovens only hold two at a time so its best to call your order in  on mondays   know as pizza mondays  your large 16 inch pizza is 7 99   that is unheard of   you cannot order a pizza that reasonable anywhere and also have it taste good           i say   give it a try   ciao 
just opened down the street from me in waverly   very crowded but we had a party of 7 and did get seated fairly quick  the chips are thin and hot and good   table salsa was fresh and spicy    guacamole was lacking and flavoring and mostly chopped lettuce    the chili rellenos were wonderful   big and crisply fried   2 in the order  i had the cheese filled ones and i loved them   tacos were good  could have had a bit more meat   the regular margarita was plain an needed more lime  i will go back again     for tex mex it was very good  
this is a great place to have a cold brew or a nice drink  it has a good atmosphere and the staff at the bar are great  they are friendly  fun  and knowledgeable  the best part is the music  great selection  if your looking for a good selection of whiskey this is the place   plus where can you go where the bartender can tie his own bowtie  as the doctor says     bowties are cool 
dr  shelly is the best  she knows what shes doing and what she is talking about  she is able to work on anyone  i use her  and i refer all of my clients to her  local vegas  henderson residents get their first adjustment free  what could be better than that  go in and have dr  shelly adjust you  now  youre still reading   call her  or better yet just drop in  just do it  i promise  you will not regret it 
phx suns dont let you print tickets till 5 days before the event  and when you can print them out  look and see how much they dropped the prices  they wait to see the demand and jack up or lower the ticket prices  the should be the same everyday and not screw over the people that order months ahead and let the waiters get tickets half price and they refuse to price match  this is not fair and do not pre order your tickets  they will drop in price 5 days before the game   suns are a bunch of scam artist and hide behind ticket master   buyer beware unless you like paying double than the guy in the seat next to you  
baby back ribs             ok phoenix  well reading all these reviews and im sad  this place hands down has the best baby back ribs in the valley period   but most people in phx dont know what good food is anyways  these baby back are smoked to perfection and so god dam tender  and there rub is great and i get them  wet  sauced then grilled again  side are ok but im not going there for the sides  im there for those baby back ribs  trust me just go and get a slab or five now 
if youre looking for a low lit upscale bar with exceptional service  go to m bar   my friend and i came here for a quick cocktail and we were far from disappointed  from the second i drove into the montelucia  i was given complimentary valet service  from there  the valet manager walked me to the m bar  opened the door for me and welcomed me   at the bar  our drinks were made promptly  the drinks were a good size  and very well made  we ended up getting two drinks each during our visit    we sat down at the many couches they have around the bar  and a server took care of us from there  i didnt have cash to tip the valet at the time  so i asked him if they had a working atm  he said they did but he wasnt sure if it was working  he then ran  literally  to the hotel lobby to check if it was working  i was very impressed by this  as things like this show the level of customer service that the employees are held to at the mbar and the montelucia   very impressed  will be coming back here for sure 
dont even bother with the big guys like safelite  these guys are the real deal  from first contact to the moment they show up at your door with your brand new glass  i contacted them and got a quote in less than 20 minutes  i texted the owner a day prior and scheduled them to come out monday evening  they were there within an acceptable time frame  and got right to work  i cant tell you how pleased i am with this company  living in a state like arizona  windshield cracks are very common and i am so happy to have found these guys  they did a top notch job and the glass windshield they put on my car is very high quality  and not to mention has a lifetime guarantee  i will be keeping their number in my phone for future needs   dont waste any time quoting around  just call them and you wont be disappointed  thank you for being an awesome company  keep it up  they are here to stay 
had a late night sweet tooth and menchies was where i ended up  amazing flavored with an abundance of toppings  i will be coming to menchies a lot more 
roadhouse cinemas is a slightly better studio movie grill  with a western theme that is slightly tacky and almost looks like it wasnt given a full effort  i came to this place for the first time due to a groupon  2 tickets  popcorn  and 2 beers for  21  the price is unbeatable and i will agree that it is an amazing deal    the reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best dine in movie theater in arizona i have visited  but the service here is truly lacking  our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive  i had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them  server didnt really check on us unless we pressed the call button  i wouldve ordered more had they checked in    the roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two  fully loaded quesadillas  but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share  i understand its happy hour  but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order    the white cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn  i was pleased with it    the restroom was decent  one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadnt been replaced in some time     overall  i will be coming back and will be recommending this place  but i hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff  this place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard 
tasty but small portion  friendly service but imo not worth the money they charge for for what you get
this is one of two pizza places located inside the new york new york hotel  i tried both of them being that im a huge new york style pizza fan  i would say that sirricos is the best one   the slices were very big  i went with just cheese slices  the sauce was good  and the crust was to as well  stays open really late  so after a night of hanging out  or winning some money at the casino  walk over there and enjoy a slice 
first place i went to here in the hotel  i mean  it is the new york new york hotel  so its only right to enjoy some za    thats pizza folks   the pizza here is fair  nothing that made me say ill come back for a late night slice   customer service here is    not that good  very uninterested  i was waiting in line with no one around  and it seemed like the guy working there and me were having a staring contest  he said nothing to me  kind of weird  so i just said what i wanted and it got done 
their vegetarian entree is actually a well thought out  tasty unique meal  not something thrown together to satisfy the veg heads  all the food we had was great  and a lovely selection of beers  really nice guys too  this place has it going on 
i like vons most of the time   their produce is hit and miss sometimes though 
love the sob pizza   just like in chicago
the food is sometimes hit and miss here   even though the law clearly says that you cannot smoke inside they often turn a blind eye to people smoking at the bar which is a huge turn off   when i am there and it effects me  i have been known to leave  and advise the staff why  unfortunately  they could care less 
nice people work here  the place is always clean and the gas is shell 
i needed to get my oil changed and i waited a couple days and did not have time to go to the dealership so i stopped in   plus its only a couple minutes from my house  there were already two cars getting an oil change  but it was only a couple minutes  they offered me a beverage  actually a couple times  which was nice  and they pulled up my car  they told me my car is usually synthetic oil and asked if i wanted that one  i told them yes  after a couple minutes the young gentleman asked me if i ever had a transmission flush  or something like that   he explained it   even if i did not understand some of it  haha   and told me he can do a discount for it  i told him to go ahead with it  the whole process took less than waiting at the dealership  and i do not have to leave my car   everyone that i encountered  about 4 employees  was professional and welcoming  i will definitely be back when my oil needs to be changed again 
came here on a  monday night  it was not busy  i ordered a mixed drink  the raspberry mule and it was delicious    it was a work outing   for my fiance   so we had a large table    the beer cheese  was yummy  its a little on the thicker side  but that did not bother me that much   the fish tacos were pretty good as well  they use cod  which is good since i do not like tilapia  it had a little spicy to it  but still very good   we had several flat breads   some i do not even know the name of  one was a mongolian and it was so gooood  it did have a bit too much sour cream for my liking  but i just took some of it off  they had a bruschetta flatbread as well and it was very good  but had a little too much balsamic drizzle   definitely a good veggie option   i had another one  it had a bbq drizzle  i think  but that was very delicious  my favorite of them all    there was way more food on the table as well   i just did not get a chance to taste them because i was way too full from everything else i ate    the food  overall was good for bar food  the place was way bigger than i thought it would be  plenty of tables and even a patio 
no breakfast all day  sadly   they stop at noon  so chorizo also becomes unavailable   the employees were very nice about it though  especially the goateed gentleman who seemed like the supervisor  manager   the lovely mexican pastries that greet you are very affordable  though the flan is a touch expensive at  4   3  depending on the type    my fish quesadilla was somewhat small  about the size of a taco bell one   it was beautifully crispy with good flavors and actual texture  but was also  7 50   it came with a small scoop of guacamole on the side   my large slice of cheesecake from the pastry case was 99 cents  and had a very light texture   the yellow cake like top layer gave it a good chew  and it was very creamy too   i ate the entire thing  and i feel it balanced out the slightly small quesadilla in terms of overall value   atmosphere is okay  with wood and brick   i can see why people are comparing it to chipotle   i definitely appreciate that theyre trying   the restroom was very nice and clean   there was a strange chemical or burning rubber smell in the air when they were grilling something though   very unpleasant   it was interesting to note they had a pretty strong caucasian clientele coming in while i ate  so hopefully they will stay part of the neighborhood   one of the employees started cleaning the glass right behind me just now and the windex smell is really awful   im going to be slightly generous with my stars and boost them up to 4  since theyre a solid 3 5 and i really appreciate a slightly more upscale  clean  new   fast casual  restaurant choice in the neighborhood   their dessert choices  pastry  cut fruit  ice cream  popsicles  really help set them apart from the competition 
cevapi  greasy  crispy  savory  chewy  and a must try if youre a bread and sausage person   the breads crispy exterior and chewy interior  almost like the interior of an english muffin  are fantastic   i have to stress that its very greasy though  so make sure you have napkins as you tear off pieces of bread to wrap the little sausages in   definitely best when its hot and fresh   it gets more greasy and less flavorful if you let it cool for a while   the small size was huge   baklava  decent but ive had better   its definitely solid and not as high priced as some other places  but my piece wasnt as flakey and crispy as i would like  and the layers were more dense and wet than i would prefer   tulumba  a surprisingly good donut of light cruller like dough soaked in a simple sugar syrup and served cold   i had let mine sit for a while in its to go container so it was soaked through with watery simple syrup but still mostly chilled   i didnt mind the sogginess myself   there was a giant  filling one of the adjoined dining rooms  group but the waitress was able to squeeze my to go order out without too long of a wait   she also offered me a glass of water as i waited  which i appreciated   the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too   they have a selection of milka and other international brand chocolate bars for sale at the register   its nice to have something different from the preponderance of mexican  italian  chinese  and burger places that seem to dominate this area   a definite must try for bread and meat connoisseurs   just be warned about the greasiness   i had a bit of a stomachache later in the day which may have been from this   edit  taking the rating down a few stars because the stomach issues afterwards were awful   food poisoning from undercooked sausage perhaps 
a fun  dessert and a show  place for kids and adults alike   this nitro gen  ice cream shop puts a unique twist on the typical  pick a flavor then pick a topping or mix in  ice cream parlor   without fail youll see people taking out their cellphones to take photo or video of the freezing process   the texture of their signature base was unbelievably smooth and creamy  almost to the point of soft serve   the chocolate chip brownie of my  brownie bowl   which is just a brownie shoved into the side of the bowl  was obviously fresh baked and deliciously chewy  gooey  and chocolatey   definitely worth the  1 50 upgrade   the mint flavor of the actual ice cream was a little on the weak side though  and the brownie somewhat overpowered it   i appreciated the complimentary water cups on the pickup counter   they were only running one cashiers  and some customers were taking extreme amounts of time ordering   i suppose the only good thing about this is that it lets the employees in the line making the ice cream try to catch up on the orders   having an employee working the line and explaining the process so that the cashier doesnt have to might be a good idea   its all hard surfaces inside  so its going to be very loud   also  i am not a fan of the television screen menu boards as the font is not easy on the eyes   bolding the text would help a lot to those with less than stellar vision   id go back  and think it would be a fun experience to bring others to see   the brownie was truly superb 
i actually liked this one more than love  and it had less sleepy downtime than o  though os soundtrack is superb    it wasnt as action packed as ka  and the storyline was even less prominent than mystere   basically its just a serious of circus acrobatic acts   if thats something youd enjoy  then youd like this production   dont expect a flowing storyline though 
perfection in a styrofoam cup   i selected a regular half  blue   vanilla  half wedding cake shave ice with ice cream  mochi  and a snow cap  condensed milk on top    it was amazing  and definitely real hawaiian shave ice   bonus points for not using those horrible wooden spatula spoons some places use  but having decent plastic ones   the owners were extremely friendly  and theyre  locals  from hawaii too   their ingredients  syrups all come from honolulu   they mentioned that they do private parties  events  and fundraisers too   i was also offered a sample of any other flavors they had  but i was far too into devouring my creamy vanilla cake concoction to take them up on it today   i will definitely be back   note that theyre prices are half of snoh on camelbacks  with the trade off being less atmosphere  its very plain inside  and less deluxe toppings   snohs flavor infused ice is also more  sticky  and  fluffy  while ks has a better bite  chew  texture to it  and has much more flavor thanks to the generous use of syrup 
i ordered the  1 99 milkshake special at their food counter   it was pretty easy for me to learn and use the touchscreen ordering system   i had super fast checkout at the register   the vanilla shake had a decent  albeit mild but not artificial taste   it actually tastes like it has vanilla extract in it   it was perfectly thick and cold   the cup was styrofoam  so the drink stayed chilled  and the extra wide  thick straw made the shake drinkable   gas prices are lower than chevron  but not as low as costco   the large has area under the canopy is well lit at night and the employees arent surly   they actually say hello to you and are polite and helpful 
waited almost an hour for a table sunday afternoon   the restaurant is quite loud  and i found the music somewhat loud and rather grating  its all top 50 female pop star music   britney spears and company    i dont see why they dont have seating on their patio  or why they have a ping pong table out there taking up valuable space   i started with their  3 50 hot chocolate   it was cinnamony  and the whipped cream definitely helped its richness   i would have preferred it hotter and less syrupy  as it was slightly hersheys chocolate milk flavored   with bolder flavors  darker chocolate  more cinnamon  and a temperature increase it would be much better   i tried the breakfast pot pie which consisted of a sheet of flakey pastry topped with cream gravy  no large sausage chunks despite what the waitress said  that included many large chunks of undercooked carrots  and an egg sunny side up   i added on a side of chicken sausage   3 75  which was not tasty   very bland and a little dry   i shouldve gotten the chorizo   the hashed brown potatoes were undercooked   everything was cooling off when it was served  rather than being steaming hot   the food was fine  but i didnt appreciate the multitude of undercooked carrots at all   the gravy couldve used more sausage and spice  heat   it was a good idea for a dish  but the components outside the egg and basic puff pastry crust didnt deliver   service was okay  though i didnt care for the waitress splitting the ticket down the middle  instead of breaking it into separate checks   parking was easy in front of nordstrom rack  which you can peruse while you wait for them to text you that your table is ready   im glad i finally got to check this place out  but i dont see myself coming back  especially considering their prices 
great customer service    they found a flaw in the glasses i wanted and ordered me a fresh pair from the factory    the ladies working there were professional  and fun to interact with   want to go buy another pair 
anytime a service provider is assigned by your home warranty it is hard because you never know what you are going to get   i set up my first appointment with jennifer to get our frigidaire refrigerator repaired   she was polite and professional and helped to find the first appointment she had where our refrigerator was down   our service man eddie showed up right on time to evaluate the situation  unfortunately a new ice maker was needed   so the home warranty had to be contacted to approve and get the parts ordered so there would need to be a second appointment     we were called as soon as they had a eta for the part and we set up the appointment   eddie showed up right on time today and was very professional and worked to get the ice maker installed asap   unfortunately frigidaire makes a product that when a ice maker blows it also shorts the computer board  which none of us knew  so eddie has to order another part     the repair is taking some time but is not something has 24  7 can control and unfortunately going through a home warranty slows down the process   however everyone we have worked with during this painful process at has 24  7 has been great and we have no complaints   
i took a chance as the review were all really good   i had gone to this salon when it first opened by the previous owners   i loved it then and now i am back to being a fan   i had tried a couple of other placed in the meantime but thought i would check out and see how it is now   i was looking for somewhere new to get my eyebrows done   i generally dont like to have them done at a nail salon but saw they now have an esthetician available     i called made an appointment and when i walked in nicole was ready and waiting  she took the time to ask me what i wanted to have done as well as what i did not want to have done   she was great      she really listened and did a fabulous job   it was worth the 3   4 month wait i had given myself to grow my brows back out to fix what the last place i went to did   thanks nicole   looking forward to coming back in a few weeks for a touch up and hopefully a facial     i will also be booking some  me  time for a much needed pedi and mani    
youll see more sharks here than in the pacific  i only come here for the service department  there its shark less 
jesi is amazing   i have been going to jesi for about 3 years for my hair care needs  she does excellent work and i wouldnt trust any one else with my hair  she listens to me and does my hair exactly how i want it  i recommend jesi for all your hair care needs   you will not regret it 
this place is now my favorite spot in charlotte for indian food  hands down  its a newly built restaurant with plenty of room inside in there dining space and bar area  the wait staff were extremely nice and helpful    the food was great and the menu has plenty to choose from  the gobi manchurian was our favorite   everyone should try it  no  you have to try it    great place and great authentic indian food  
we came here for breakfast and had a really good time  we were able to be seated as soon as we walked in with no problems  they also have complimentary parking  we sat outside where we was covered in a shaded area  the wait staff was great  attentive  knowledgeable and patient with us since it was our first time eating there    the food was really good too  i had the sweet potato pancakes and scrambled eggs and she had the shoo fly shrimp and grits  the biscuits with jam  honey was soo good too  they were not skimping on the champagne in our mimosas either lol    overall this was a great place to have breakfast in charlotte 
celebrated my girlfriends 30th birthday here a couple of weeks ago  we reserved a table for 15 and was seated without any issues  as far as service  it was ok but could have been better  not horrible by any means  in order to accommodate everyone timely  this place has a view of downtown like no other place in charlotte  its amazing   as far as dinner  it was ok  i had the short rib which looks really good but was just ok  the bday girl really enjoyed her meal  which was the grilled salmon  so thats all that matters     others had the pizza too  fyi  that pizza is really huge lol  two people can eat on that  from what i heard  they liked it as well    after having dinner we lounged  had drinks  and just enjoyed the view  that was the main event and it didnt disappoint   nonetheless we had a great time 
my wife and i came here yesterday to get some food right before heading to work and it was great    as soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm smile from the owner herself behind the counter  the location is very spacious and has plenty of seating  it was our first time there so she helped by recommending some of the favorites off the menu    i ordered the kickin bbq chicken pizza and my wife had the vaganini sandwhich  the menu had a wide variety of selections for just about anybody  both options we had were really good  you could tell that they made the order carefully and that it wasnt just thrown together  service was outstanding and the food came out timely  cant ask for much more than that   well definitely come back here  thanks camille 
ive been here a few times for lunch uptown  its nothing amazing but its extremely convenient since its located in the wells fargo building  if youre looking for quick and simple lunch  this is the place to come  you can avoid lines and its very quite with a view out the window towards the street 
i cannot say enough good things about the food at casa mia   my hubby and i first went to this place in april during a visit to scottsdale   we went with regulars who suggested we just order several dishes and all share   given they were regulars  we allowed them to choose the dishes  at the time we didnt even look at the menu    we started with an insalata mista and then had spaghetti al fruti di mare  spaghetti alla checca  as well as a lamb dish  which must have been a special     everything was extraordinary   my husband and i spoke about the meal for days   since then we have moved to scottsdale  and tonight we went back to casa mia   both my husband and i ordered the spaghetti alla checca  can you guess which dish we liked the most the first time we were there     we both savored every bite   im a true believer that food is best when its simple  and thats exactly what this dish is  such simple ingredients yet insanely delicious   it was cooked just perfectly   my sister was with us and she ordered the tortellini alla boscaiola   she loved her dish as well  i tried a bite and it was delicious  indeed    although it was a creamy sauce  it wasnt heavy at all   the reason im giving this restaurant a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because i have 2 very minor complaints   first  they have extremely dim lighting   while this creates a nice ambiance  frankly it was very difficult to even read the menu   second  after we were done with our meals it took quite a long time for the waitress to come back to our table because she was chatting with the customers at the next table  who were clearly regulars    i completely understand that she needs to make the regulars feel important so that theyll continue coming back  but  just a thought  maybe new customers will become regulars if they get some more attention   either way  we will definitely be back for the delicious food 
this gym has been so fabulous for the past 1  and a little more  years  i am only now leaving due to a move out of the shadyside area   the people are extremely friendly  there are many class offerings  times and variety   and i have always found the equiptment to be up to date and working well  i chose x because of its location in relation to my apartment and i could not have made a better choice  there is something to be said for not  selling out  and going to one of the top name  nationally known gyms  at x shadyside  i never felt like a number and i loved supporting a local  one of a kind buisness  if youre on the fence about joining  just do it  your body and mind will thank you  and you cannot beat the atmosphere and amazing environment that x offers  i am sad to say goodbye to this buisness 
dr  bullero delivered my second baby at banner gateway  and has been my ob gyn doctor for nearly 6 years  this office has the friendliest  most efficient staff around  the well woman exams are done by a nurse practitioner  and becky is ultra fast and so sweet  her bedside manner coincides with dr  bs and you really feel valued as a patient  i would highly recommend this office to anyone looking to have a personal relationship with their doctors office and to have their baby delivered by the absolute best doctor around 
i was hoping the new ownership would bring a newer  more efficiently run restaurant  but that was far from the case  they open at 11am on saturdays    i know this because thats when i went in to have an early lunch  we were the first table sat outside on their mosquito infested patio  i saw one other table inside with a older couple at it  we ordered drinks  and then quickly ordered our food because we were hungry  45 minutes later  empty water glass in front of me and still no food  waitress declares she is doing everything she can but one of the steak entrees takes a long time  i wait 15 more minutes  making my total time at this restaurant 1 hour and 18 minutes  i finally had to get up and walk out because i had prior engagements to be some where and never imagined a simple lunch taking this long  so  no lunch  unreal how disappointed i was in the wait for food  as well as the lack of eagerness to earn back my business when i was leaving and let them know to cancel my food  never again 
lindsay was extra accommodating for an order i needed done in a rush  quality was top notch and her communication and eagerness to earn my business was unmatched  absolutely would recommended this company to anyone looking for reasonable prices and outstanding service 
sam fox comes to gilbert     yayyyy       that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated zin burger  i dined here opening week  and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out  not so much    the servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality i am used to from the other fox concepts    both visits i ordered the same thing    sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad  the fries keep this review afloat  they are perfectly crisp  and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want  yum  order two servings    the garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream  with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein  too bad they drench it in salad dressing  i had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent  pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet  i asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one  the manager didnt verbally address me  or the soup    i mean  salad  she did comp the salad  but i have no incentive to go back for another round of this  my husband is probably accurate when he said  you cant order a salad when you go to a burger place  
we live across the street from mabels and are frequent shoppers there  it is a fantastic neighborhood spot and a great place to drop in on a saturday or sunday morning when youre walking the dog   our favourites include  croissants  almond croissants  sourdough bread  any of the cookies  the carrot cake  the empanadas  veg or meat   and the roast beef arugala   horseradish sandwich on a pretzel bun  every item is made with care and the best ingredients  also they brew a mean cup of coffee   they are not getting 5  5 stars from me because the prices are a touch high  although i respect the business and the quality of ingredients they are paying for   and mostly because my husband adores the almond croissants   the grid  rip  even did a write up on them   and they never have them anymore  inventory management issue i suppose   anyways if you havent been  go  awesome spot to grab a dessert if youre having a dinner party too   pies  cakes  squares etc  are perfection 
no  but you dont understand  it isnt like that  guys  it isnt snooty  it isnt scene  in fact  if you didnt know that everything here was good and virtuous  that whatever your dietary requirements you are probably guaranteed to find it catered for  you wouldnt realise that that was the whole point  sure  theres gluten free stuff  vegan stuff  dairy free stuff  juice cleanses  organic boosters  aaaaaaall that jazz   but it doesnt feel preachy or superior   its just    really nice  wooden tables  big front window in a leafy street in marchmont just beside the meadows  lots of light and space  and a mighty fine looking lemon tart i want to go back and try  yep  its a winner  maybe they could do with a couple more comfy places to sit  perhaps  as one of my lasting memories is of  quite hard    however  my carrot  orange and celery juice was a super refreshing start to a day that would later contain  from another establishment  two coffees in a row and the worlds largest slice of red velvet cake  and yet i felt healthy all day because of the juice  maybe thats the only danger here  the ability to fool yourself your diet is just fine because you feel so good from just the smallest meadowlarking of a morning 
im not an outdoorsy type by any stretch of the imagination  and my imagination is particularly stretchy  so its rare for me to find myself in a place like this  but i followed my friend in as she hunted for a new waterproof for her climbing exploits   at first we were a bit disappointed by the apparently small shop and there wasnt much besides coats at all  although not  that we could see  the kind she sought   then we realised there was another floor  and when we ascended the stairs   oh my  an emporium of gargantuan proportions stocking just about everything i could think would ever be useful   we made a beeline for the rest of the coats and were fairly promptly approached by one of the staff  who asked if she could help us  my friend  who had a very specific idea of what she wanted  tried to explain what she was looking for  but didnt seem to be able to communicate the idea too clearly  i being a not expert in terminology was unable to assist  the girl was very helpful  though  and really knew her stuff  i stood by and let them exchange terminology and brand names for a bit   trying to figure out what the item being described was  she mentioned two things that we had missed downstairs  but said that one was definitely too large for my friend and the only one in stock  while the others were more expensive than my friends budget allowed   when we went back downstairs and browsed again  she was absolutely right   the two items wed missed on our first scout around were almost perfect except one being the wrong size and the other being a bit pricey  so we didnt find what wed gone in for  but there was a wide selection of brands and items available  beyond the oh so trendy the north face  and the assistant was very knowledgeable  trying very hard to help 
ok  so  as promised  here is an update    and its still four stars   i wonder if its because i have this unnerving habit of actually going into the office in person when i have a question  but epm have been nothing short of angelic to me  back in december  when we had that maaaad weather in december when the rain was kinda blowing upwards under the eves  i emailed them two days before christmas to say a couple of drips were coming through the ceiling  thats all it was  a few drips  but i was sad that when i got back from christmas they hadnt got back to me  im cutting them some slack because theyd probably left for the holidays when my email came through and things get lost  if id been really bothered id have phoned  but there was no damage done   now then  a couple of weeks ago  my washing machine broke down  i did my usual trick of walking into the office to mention it and at the same time i explained about my email that had gone astray  they were supremely apologetic  in two days  an engineer was round to fix my machine  and today i had a call checking to see that hed been  and asking if anyone had sorted my ceiling yet too  i said yes to the former  no to the latter  and they promised to get onto it   i never expected unprompted communication from them on any matter not relating to finance  im impressed  this is the key  folks  dont email  dont phone  walk in  thats kind of my approach to stuff anyway but thats my tip to you 
tried this restaurant for the first time over the weekend  on fri  sat  sun  the buffet was the only option  the food on the buffet was not very good  the chicken tikka masala had no flavor  while the chicken biryani had plenty of flavor  it just wasnt a flavor that i liked  they had mango lassi drinks in glasses by the buffet  but the drink was warm  which is never good in a mango lassi  the 87 5 sanitation rating also threw me off   the restaurant is in a nice spot  i was actually hoping for a more casual style indian restaurant  since this seems to be a chain  but its a traditional sit down restaurant  bim  sp    formerly of blue taj  was running the restaurant the day i visited   i dont know if the dishes would suffer so much individually if ordered off the menu  i have noticed that the chicken tikka masala on a buffet always seems worse than a fresh version of the dish  i just know that i was not impressed at all by the quality of what was on the buffet  i hope they do well  but i will probably not return for the buffet  and ill definitely wait for that sanitation score to go up before i return again 
we visited woodlands at 8pm on a saturday night  the restaurant was completely packed with local indian families  which i take to be an excellent sign that the food is authentic   unfortunately  the wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed  it took 20 minutes for someone to even come by our table and take our orders  and another 20 minutes for our samosas to come out of the kitchen  once we had the samosas  the rest of the food came out in a timely fashion  but waiting until 8 40 for our food was agonizing  i was sat with my back to the kitchen and i was so hungry that i kept looking over my shoulder  to the point that my husband said   trust me honey   once it looks like our food is coming i will stand up and  applaud  there is no reason to keep looking behind you    service and food slowness aside  our meals were excellent  i ordered the chana masala  my husband ordered dal makhani  i had reservations about visiting a vegetarian indian restaurant  but the food was really very  very good  woodlands wont ever be the first on my list to visit  because i prefer meat based dishes  but if youve got a vegetarian friend who wants to eat somewhere  dont shy away from woodlands because theres no meat on the menu   the service wasnt terribly friendly  which is quite different from what im accustomed to with my favorite indian restaurants  my favorite places are in dc  actually   but the food was terrific   woodlands was quite a haul from our ballantyne home  but it was good to visit once to see what the fuss was all about  the food was fantastic  but with the distance  long waits to get our food and poor service  i doubt we will be back  if youre in the area and hankering for indian food at a less busy time  i recommend visiting 
521 has been around for several years  and now that the area around it is more developed  theyve added a nice outdoor patio  i love 521 bbqs pulled pork  it has a mildly smoky flavor  and you get the brown crusty parts of the pork too    the ambiance at 521 isnt much to write home about  but i love to drop in to pick up a couple of pounds of pulled pork to go  its about  10  lb hot  but if youre willing to take it home and reheat it  theyll sell you the remnants of yesterdays pork  already refrigerated  for about  6 which is a much better deal  i pick up that  a thing of their vinegar based sauce  and im good for a week  love the stuff  its not the absolute best ive ever eaten  but its pretty high up there 
we had never purchased anything from the meat house before  but that didnt stop me from bidding on a charitys silent auction item that featured several selections from their store   several months after winning  i called the store owner and he was incredibly helpful  letting me know that i only needed to call them 20 30 minutes in advance to have my package ready for pickup   when we picked up our order  i was truly impressed by so much about the store  the variety and quality of their meats  cheeses and wine  and the samples of their meat  olive oil and vinegar on display  the storefront seems more like a place youd find in napa  california or tuscany  rather than in charlotte  north carolina   the employees were friendly the moment i approached the place  with one wishing me a great day even as she was leaving at the end of her shift  and holding the door for me   i scoured the store looking for something truly unique to buy along with my auction items  and settled on crab cakes  one of my favorites since im from the maryland area  a man behind the counter took pains to get me the best recipe to fix them  and even recommended a restaurant in town that he thought served the  best  once he knew i was a crab cake aficionado   i returned home with a slew of meat and a delighted husband  who graciously packed up everything in freezer  foodsaver bags in portions we would eat  everything we unwrapped was exceptionally fresh and a far step above what you might find in a grocery stores butcher selection   to date  weve feasted on hamburgers  chicken breasts   meat house  marinated turkey tips and maple bourbon marinated steak tips  last night we had the steak tips  which is what prompted me to write this review  everything is delicious  but i could not get enough of the maple bourbon steak tips  as someone who  hates  bourbon  thanks to a college experience with some  i was wary of these tips  and ordered them only because my husband wanted them   they were the most delicately flavored  savory and tender bites of meat ive had in a long  long time    my husband is bragging to his friends about this  great deal  that i scored  and we look forward to trying the many other items we ordered from the meat house  we are new customers  and we will most definitely be back  the quality of the food weve had from them is simply unparalleled  you owe it to yourself to try this place out 
visited for the first time last night and for a saturday night the place was a madhouse  still  the bartenders kept their cool  were fast on the drinks  and kept a smile on their faces throughout all the crazy   didnt eat at blackfinn last night  but their menu looked good so we stopped in just before noon today for lunch  also wanted to see the restaurant when it wasnt packed wall to wall  service was really prompt and solid  which almost always is the challenge new restaurants face  the wait staff seemed very well trained and i was impressed   fish and chips were delicious  my husband loved his french dip style sandwich  i like this location much better than the uptown location  well be back 
visited shanes for a late lunch this past weekend  its a small place  located in the strip mall in front of wal mart  you order at the counter  they take your name and give you a glass for your drink  and then they call your name when your order is ready   i ordered the smothered sandwich and a drink for under  10  with a side of potato salad  the food came out fast  and there was plenty of it for lunch  the potato salad was served in a styrofoam container next to the sandwich  which was packed with plenty of pork and cole slaw  i was a big fan of the cole slaw   the food was good  but it wasnt great  its what id expect from a strip mall barbecue place  i didnt taste much smoke  it doesnt taste like authentic carolina barbecue to me at all  still  its plenty of food and a tasty meal with plenty of tangy sauces to choose from  its on par with other chain style barbecue restaurants in the area    not knock my socks off awesome  but solid and tasty   i recommend this place for families or couples looking for a low key meal at a decent price  the restaurant is clean  and the service is attentive and friendly 
there have been stories in the news lately about business owners vilifying their unhappy customers on social networks after their establishment received negative reviews  in light of that textbook example of how not to do business   im happy to say that elwoods management sets a perfect example of how you should do business   after my first  lackluster review of elwoods  and particularly of their pork barbecue  justin   the owner of elwoods reached out to me  he let me know they had reworked some of their menu items  including how they hold the pork after its cooked  so that it retains its flavor better  he offered to send me a gift certificate to try out the restaurant again  i hung onto the certificate over the holidays and my husband and i managed to get in to give elwoods a second try last thursday   i ordered the pulled pork platter  along with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese  as we waited  someone came by with some cornbread for us  which i hadnt been able to try on my first visit  its good  but a little cakey and a bit messy because it falls apart so easily   once our food arrived  i couldnt wait to dig into the pork  justin wasnt lying  the pork really is really good now  it had a nice smokey flavor to it  which was exactly what i was missing before  it was substantially improved over the pork i had the first time  my husband ordered the potato wedges and green beans along with brisket  i think  i wasnt looking over at his plate much because i was so busy with my own   we both really enjoyed our meal   if yelp allowed for 4 5 stars  id grant it to elwoods  i enjoyed my meal and i will be back  equally as impressive as the food improvements however  are the people who run and staff this restaurant  they are a class act 
due  no doubt  to its being the largest working theatre in the whole of the uk  the playhouse always has an impressive programme  there are a lot of seats to fill  and there are plenty of other venues in edinburgh playing to the more adventurous  so theres nothing to criticise about the fact that the playhouse caters to a popular audience  large scale touring musicals  usually from londons west end  are the main bill of fare  with big name musicians and successful tv comedians forming the bulk of the rest   as youd expect  it can deal with pretty much any technical requirement  the stage is enormous  and the lighting demands the playhouse accommodated for the joe bonamassa concert last month were pretty jaw dropping  i think it might have been the most complex rig ive ever seen   the first time i came here  to see  oliver     samantha barks was playing nancy  i was amazed at its apparent application of timelord technology  it looks so weeny from the front  but inside    golly  it just goes on and on  i dont just mean the capacity  but the fact is that the seats in the balcony arent as steeply raked as many other theatres so the rows are more widely spaced  there was sufficient leg room even for a giantess of my lengthy proportions  joy  that does mean  however  that the back row is really quite far back  but the sightlines from just about anywhere in the main auditorium are pretty faultless  even in  restricted view  seats    the only part that seems rather cramped is the foyer  there isnt much room for milling about pre show  however  the front of house staff are all pretty perky  its a marked contrast with theatres in london  which are peopled for the most part by out of work actors and generally have an air of wistful despondence as a result   one parting fact  i read recently that this was originally  when built in 1929  a cinema  a cinema  oh  how i wish that cinemas these days had vaulted ceilings  gilded boxes  noble featured statues and comfortable velvet seats  and ambassador  theatre group   with zis four month residency of ze lion king you are spoiling us 
i am only reviewing the two eating establishments here since we didnt stay here   it was a time when we were both overly hungry and needed food asap   the sandwich from the hotel was great the first bite and it got exponentially worse after every bite  since i was no longer starving   then we headed to that madelines bakery that had just opened and ordered some eclairs   those eclairs looked good but the dough was gummy and soggy   the cream tasted like jello instant vanilla pudding and the chocolate outside tasted like jello chocolate pudding   all in all  everything looked pretty but didnt taste great 
parking fees in casinos on the strip  love coming to vegas  we used to frequent visiting sin city  sometimes three times a year  but lately have slowed down and this year  2017  was our first time back in vegas since feb 2016  wow  has it been that long    no wonder i was longing for it in this last mini getaway  anyway  found out that many of the casinos have done away with the free parking  the good old days of plentiful free parking at casinos ended in 2016  bummer  wait  i take that back    i think some casinos offer 0 60 mins free parking  its true that parking garages here are so abundant but unless youre staying at or patronizing the resort you have to fork out   for parking fees  now its all about parking in one spot  pay the fees  and walk  walk  walk    i suppose one can take the monorails too    while im done ranting about the newly imposed parking fees  new to me  at least  i do enjoy walking around the strip  im not talking about from one end to another  i enjoyed it best during pacquiaos fights held at the mgm  held usually in may   hubby and i come to vegas to celebrate our birthdays around that time  loved the hype it brought  i also enjoyed the outdoor shows    treasure island  the mirage and bellagio    and damn those las vegas card flickers  if youve ever been to vegas  you know what im talking about  although  i didnt see any this time while walking around treasure island and crossing over to wynn  are they gone now   if flying in vegas one can see the strip with all the lights as your plane is about to land  i always look for either the stratosphere  the tallest observation tower in the u s   or the light beam from the luxor on the southern end  the luxor sky beam is the strongest beam of light in the world   i look for these landmarks when our plane is about to descend at mccarran intl airport  lots of car traffic as well as foot traffic on the strip  lots of lights  lots of tourists  lots of shops  restaurants  bars and lounges  this place comes alive on weekends   what happens in vegas stays in    facebook  ig  and snapchat  nowadays   be mindful     review  0838
awful costumer service    i felt like i was being rushed even though there werent any people behind me  im assuming the woman who  assisted  me was a manger because she was the only one i saw in a red shirt  but she needs a course on costumer service  she was very short and acted as if i was wasting her time  i dont care how badly we want bagels we will never return to this location 
first time eating here  delicious deep dish pizza and cannolis   friendly service  will definitely come back 
stopped here for lunch uptown and had a cheese and barbecue chicken pizza  both pizzas were real good and the service was good too  the wait was average and they served you at your table when your pizza is ready  since its called fuel pizza  the entire place is designed like a gas station  pretty cool and different 
very goood ribs  i preferred the rub without the sauce  deep fried corn is awesome 
love this joint  lived in los angeles  san diego  seattle and denver  co  the thirsty beaver is awesome       i know a great bar  johnny cash would be a fan if he was alive 
ok wings  great selections in hot sauces  good cold beer  great place to watch sports  they need new tvs 
never disappointed and their bone in rib eye is their signature steak  no corkage fee 
if you live in highland creek or sky brook area  this pizza joint is a great addition to the other restaurants around our hood  you can order by the slice or pie  great place to have a quick beer and slice of pizza  beer specials during the week  new york style pizza with attitude  small bar area with plenty of free parking  ill give it 5 stars just because i like their ny attitude   close to home 
i absolutely love caribou coffee especially this location because its located in the beautiful south park   fox croft area  the baristas here are super friendly and if your looking for a nice place to study or get work done on your laptop this location is not too noisy it has a beautiful cozy cabin feel to it 
i have been meaning to try this place but whenever i am craving japanese food it always seemed to be on a sunday and sundays they are closed  so last night  i finally got off my lazy butt and headed out to try this place   the inside was bigger than i thought  it was pretty spacious and there was a bar area for people dining alone  on the table is a jar of sesame seeds and a jar of katsu sauce  the server then gave us a tiny mortar and pestle that you use to grind the seeds  you can add this later on to the katsu sauce  that was an interesting experience for sure    so we ordered the gyoza to start  i had the pork curry katsu and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu  both of the katsus were delicious  they cooked it crispy on the outside while the meat remain moist  i hate dry katsu so they really hit it spot on at this place  what i think made them stood out the most from other japanese places is their katsu sauce  it is delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy  i loved it so much that i even dipped my pork katsu more on that sauce rather than the curry sauce that it came with   i highly recommend this place  i love their matcha green tea too  it was perfect 
this place is so cute for adults and for kids  they have tons of candy to choose from  many of which are hard to find  toys  books  etc  my shopping buddy picked out a few things for an upcoming grandchild and i was sucked into the candy  service was a little slow but the lady at the counter told us she doesnt work there often  i didnt mind the wait though because it was fun to shop  look around at all the novelties  if youre looking for a little distraction in old town for the kiddos or just have a sweet tooth for candy  you should stop by 
ill keep this short and sweet  i came with a friend for hh one night and liked the vibe  food and service  the sushi rolls here are above average and i liked the variety  the surf and turf roll was really delicious and i would recommend it  the prices here were pretty high so be prepared 
we went here late one night for dinner because it was the only mexican place open past 10pm  the bar was the only place available to sit down so we ordered drinks and got chips and salsa  i ordered the albondigas soup and a bean burro  the soup was extremely salty  too salty to the point where i told our waiter i wasnt able to eat it  the burro was ok  i only ordered it because it was on the a la carte menu and cheap  i will say the service was pretty fast and attentive but it still isnt saving it for me to return anytime soon 
i used to think tropicana was a dump but after the remodel  the place looks great  it looks really clean and modern inside  definitely a place you want to hang out   our party checked out the pool and had a great time  good size pool  swim up blackjack  bar  i mean what else could you ask for  food options looked amazing  i didnt eat here but saw all the places   a couple of friends had a room here and the room was also very nicely remodeled  love gambling here for the cheap tables but looks nothing like before   go check it out  i think i might stay here next time im in vegas 
let me start off by saying my review is only to discuss lunar bingo nights  because i really havent explored much else of the casino  fort mcdowell is easy to find  once you are on the 87n  with the big flashy signs for miles  this casino is smoky for sure but there are non smoking rooms in the bingo lounge  the lounge is really large and has a little diner where you can order food  which actually isnt half bad    lunar bingo nights are really fun and start at midnight  i would suggest getting there around 10 30pm  because it can get really packed and not many seats are available if you come late  also  it is pretty loud inside because djs come and play really loud  but great music    for lunar bingo  prices are really cheap for games  around  9 a pack  and an extra  1 2 for the extra games  drinks are also cheap   2 beers   i usually try to come with a bunch of people because it really is a fun time  people walk around with glow sticks  because lunar bingo is with the lights off so its fun to wear the glow sticks and play fun variations of bingo  cash prizes are nice  anywhere from  200  500  for payout  game  they also do a raffle   for lunar bingo  this place is fun and i have always enjoyed myself  just walking through the casino  its pretty basic and smoky  overall  not the best ive been to but it works for what it is 
this place has changed names so many times but this was the most  updated  name of the venue i could find  its current name is ak chin pavilion  anyways  i came here for the first time to see gavin degraw  the script  train last night  i read all the horrible reviews and was a little nervous coming here  we came about an hour before the concert and had no problem with finding the place  parking  getting in or finding a place on the lawn to sit  in my opinion  drinking a beer and being on the lawn was a really wonderful way to enjoy a summer night  the sound and stage set ups for all the bands were really great and thought they put on a great show  the only downside for me was the fact that everything was extremely overpriced  i paid  12 for a beer and water was a whopping  7 50  i would suggest bringing your own water and eating beforehand  the marijuana smoking on the lawn was also a small issue so if you are sensitive to that  beware  overall  had a great time and would definitely return 
i really wish i could give this place a better review  since i see it has many raving reviews  but i just didnt have that great of an experience  i love trying new places and i especially love a good sandwich so i purchased a groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by  id check it out  i liked that it was in downtown mesa and had a cute concept with the whole picnic theme so i was looking forrward to something a little different  parking is pretty limited  i got a spot on the side of the building but there wasnt a whole lot of other places to park other than the street   it wasnt very busy during the lunch rush but i still waited about 20 minutes to get my food  i only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so i was surprised it took as long as it did since they arent actually cooking anything i ordered  just putting it together  then  when i saw the size of my fruit cup  my jaw dropped open  it was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside  i think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes  sorry but if i didnt have a groupon  i would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone  then  when i tasted the sandwich  it really wasnt anything special   i remember leaving disappointed and didnt feel like it was a good value at all  i also felt like the menu is pretty limited and there really wasnt a lot on there i would be interested in eating  and i am by no means a picky eater   overall  not a place i enjoyed 
ive been here several times and only eaten at the bar but this weekend  i sat in the dining room for a nice meal with my boyfriend  we walked in around 8 30pm on a saturday night and didnt wait  although the dining room was pretty full  the booth was very spacious  could have easily fit 4 6 people  chips and salsa were quick to arrive and the salsa is really amazing  our waitress took our drink orders and was surprised when she said i couldnt have sugar around the rim of my margarita glass  hmm   never encountered that one before  margaritas were delicious though and only  4  we each had 2  they were kinda small  for dinner  i ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend ordered a burro with rice and beans  our food came pretty quick and was really delicious  the fajitas came with different types of bell peppers  onions and tomatoes  really good  the sour cream is also a little different  but good  service was prompt  nothing over the top though  i would definitely recommend mattas for good mexican food 
id eat here everyday for every meal if i could  the food here is absolutely delicious  this is probably my favourite restaurant in toronto  its nice and cozy and the prices are a little higher than other restaurants but the food is worth it  depending on what you order portions maybe medium to small  they have a nice alcohol selection that isnt to overwhelming  their winter luscious menu is good but their regular menu has all the great stuff   my only complaint is that it can get a little tight when its really busy  if you havent tried it then make your way there tonight    with a date or a loved one 
went here to eat today with some family members and when we first entered we were pretty excited  its had some renovations and the dishes popping out were looking good  i left most of the ordering to my brother and sister in law while i watched my niece  a salad came out first that wasnt really touched but next came the butter chicken  if an indian restaurant cant make butter chicken right then we have a problem  it was good but been there done that  next came out a vegetarian dish with lentils  wasnt bad and out came our plain rice  oh and plain naan and garlic naan   the food was ok and overall everyone seemed content with the portion  just shy of being comfortably full  the wait staff is very nice and water is going around regularly  they did forget to bring out one dish that we were anticipating the most  a sizzling beef dish but it never came out  not a great meal and i probably wont return  the food is the same as almost any other indian restaurant ive been to  this wasnt my brothers choice either  it was my sister in laws and she was quite disappointed as well 
holy smokes the burger was huge  i had to take a break in between bites to regain my composure before digging in again  it was our first time in an irish place but we werent too adventurous  the hail mary although big  wasnt our fav madison burger   spinach and artichoke dip  see my pic  was really generous and we were totally filled up on that before the burger even arrived  that is a  must order  if you go 
according to friends veranda is supposed to be at the same level as eno vino  and the person that told us that was severely mistaken   eno vino is a classy place with an amazing variety of dishes   veranda is good in its own right  much more expensive if youre going there for the tapas atmosphere as their tapas are expensive  youre better off ordering off the main menu   we got bruschetta  yellow squash with bacon   gorgonzola  smoked salmon dill cream cheese  slivered red onions   capers  beef tenderloin with boursin   pickled red onion  and prosciutto   fresh mozzarella  tomato  basil   balsamic drizzle  which were all great  and one main dish  rigatoni veranda style sliced italian sausage  fresh mozzarella  olive oil  roma tomatoes  garlic  pine nuts  olives   fresh basil in a signature tomato sauce  to split between two  the pasta dish came already split for us in separate plates  much appreciated   we were stuffed and the bill was pretty low  happy overall with the food and service  very clean tastes and very true to the flavors of the ingredients    as far as the ambiance  veranda is certainly trying the huge gilded mirror is beautiful and their outdoor area seemed pretty  we were indoors   the dishes are beautifully prepared and presented nicely  but the servers and host were all very casual  the way that they talked and conducted themselves left us both feeling like the restaurants staff need to have more training before they can really be a classy place  right now they are caught in the middle and need a bit more time to really hone their skills     besides that our waiter noticed our attire  we were pretty dressed up considering it was a thursday night  and asked if we were celebrating something  we were  we just got engaged     and he brought out a dessert compliments of veranda   thanks     it was a coffee ice cream stuffed inside a biscuit  not sure of the name sorry  drizzled in some chocolate sauce with cream  it was really rich and great but definitely wasnt fresh  the ice cream was way frozen and the biscuit thing was good but a little hard 
customer service is dead these days  and century link is a prime example of this   we used to have directtv but switched over to century link prism tv when our dtv contract was up   what a hassle  i thought dtv customer service was bad      century link is 10x worse   bills are wrong every time and speaking with customer service is a total nightmare   expect to spend over an hour getting anything changed   we called to add a second receiver  they missed two appointments and i sat at home all day each time waiting for them   each time i called to explain the situation they were clueless  even when i gave them my confirmation number   when i asked for a free month or something for my time wasted sitting at home all day they refused   they assured me it would be done monday    well see 
thatll teach me to order lobster bisque at a sub place    i was in town this past weekend for a variety of engagements  and wanted to get the superb lobster corn chowder at lemon falls  unfortunately i arrived in town late  a few minutes after 6pm  lemon falls closed at 6pm on saturday  so sucks to be me  but to get some food prior to attending a norwex party was my objective  so onward soldiering for the chow went me  and cheap  i should add that i was seeking inexpensive food that fateful night  well  cheap for chagrin falls anyway  so to daves subs i went  i usually get the haight ashbury  but something caught my attention saturday night  a  lobster bisque  advert on the back board  my goodness  lobster bisque at a sub place  sacre bleu  i figured id ask for a slurp to verify its decency before investing  alas though  i was told no samples  i asked where the bisque was procured  sorry we cant tell you  all we can say is someone makes it for us  hmmm  who could this elusive someone be    it was past six and i wanted to eat and run  so i figured  heck michelle  lets give it a shot    i wasnt impressed  the bisque was okay certainly  but also certainly nothing to write home about  wont make this mistake again  next time im at daves  its back to one of the classics that this place does so well 
i saw the other two reviews and thought  this cannot be correct  better put in a true account of this festival    this is the truth  this is the best festival in cleveland  a diverse array of cuisine representing the diversity of the continent of asia  a world class entertainer or entertainers have been brought in in the past few years  a child friendly environment  one where you will feel comfortable bringing junior and will be able to take him on a fun trolley ride through asiatown  free parking  yes  you read that right  free parking  last year the highlight for me was meeting cleveland mayor frank jackson  i must admit  but a close second to that would probably include drinking a refreshing coconut water  right out of the coconut 
this is a great show for the entire family    the costumes are spectacular  the set design simple but imaginative  the performances were all strong  the singing was a joy  and the music is oscar winning  whats not to like  the theatre is one large bowl  without balcony  and there really are very few poor seats in the house  acoustics were superb    about 16 years ago i watched the vhs tape of this movie about 100 times when my favorite relative was a toddler  consequently  i know the story  the music  just about every line  the show plays very true to that movie  with a few minor adjustments  but otherwise  you will recognize each scene if youve seen the movie  they even cast the performers with voices very close to the original sound  maybe not quite james earl jones as mufasa and whoopie goldberg as the lead hyena  but pretty close  scar sounds like jeremy irons  kimba and nala sound similar  even the toucan zazu has the same british accent as the disney movie  and youd swear the warthog pumbaa was ernie sabella and the meer cat timone was nathan lane   i loved the rich african singing  colors  and drum beats  the chorus was full of african performers  supplementing the mostly american lead performers with a rich undertone of african harmonies in the larger numbers  with great swahili chorals     this opened on broadway back in 1997 and won 6 tony awards  and has been here in vegas at least 5 years  as i recall  songwriters elton john and tim rice won an academy award for their music as well    after youve ooohed and aaawed over the 7 or so quebecois acrobatic shows on the strip  this is a nice and fun change of pace 
the best thing about this place are the bathrooms  no shit  er  i mean no kidding   the decor in the bathroom is expensive  mimicking a japanese ancient castle  with large cuts on stone masonry  copper pots for sinks  and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets    the next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room  it is a large rock with a spotlight on it  and mimicks a japanese rock garden   the third best thing is the out door patio seating  with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11 00pm in august  there are several tables out there  and also some couches   the 4th best thing is the pachinko machines in the entryway  brightly lit and real  however  as the cute hostess will tell you  she has no balls  for the pachinko machines  stupid    the 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks  i didnt look in there for an  orgasm  or a  sloecomfortablescrew against the wall   or other ridiculous concoctions  etc    i felt like a tanqueray and tonic   no  make it two   the rest of what they have to offer is  well  meh 
this is your classic dive asian restaurant take out buffet joint and ma pa convenience store    this places specializes in quick take out food  with a steam table of rice and other vietnamese deli foods to make assorted com dishes  there are also a few shelves of desserts and deli  convenience foods     but it has about 6 tables to sit and eat  and you can watch the tv with a dvd playing over and over again the traditional vietnamese outfit contest portion of the miss universe pageant in nha trang  vietnam   they have a decent smattering of vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm  but the food is pretty good  khai vi  pho bo  about 17 combos  hu tieu  mi xao  com dia  che  and special dishes like bun bo hue  bun rieu   banh cuon  goi du du  nem nuong cuon  etc    they also have boba drinks  coffees  etc   dont expect great service    the pho tai bo vien and pho tai came in quite large bowls  with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls  there was also a lot of noodles  more than most places  only  4 99  good price even for san jose or little saigon    if you want quick to go viet food  or a cheap and large bowl of pho in las vegas  try here  it is in a 2 story strip mall just below korean garden bbq   open 7 days a week  9 am til 9 pm 
restaurant chez parra is a great little french restaurant in longueuil  quebec  which is a suburb of montreal on the south shore  just across the waters form that thriving international city   it is long and narrow  with a salon prive  private room  in the rear  which our party of 6 occupied  amidst original art decorating the walls  the ambiance is simple  understated  casual elegance and cozy    the menu has traditional french specialities  such as foie gras for appetizer  and mains like duck lorange  veal  and even rabbit  there are a few other mediterranean infuences like canelloni and carpaccio from italy and  paella from spain  and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish  as well as other popular meat favorites   they have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special  with appetizer  main and dessert for under  24 cad  under  20 usd at todays exchange  and most of the entrees a la carte are  18    24 cad with appetizers in the  6    10 cad range   they have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings    service is very attentive  with the owner  manager  providing personalized suggestions and service    this is mostly a hidden  affordable gem for locals  but if you are ever in longueuil or along the south shore of montreal  this would be an excellent  affordable choice for good local french food 
this is the best burger i have had in a very long time   if you are craving a good burger  you have got to try this place  
interesting place with a wide variety of artisan food and art  pottery   very relaxed atmosphere but needs a bit of rigor around running a retail environment   check it out 
i came for brunch with some friends with few expectations  im normally on the west side and thought i was spoiled by the quality and quantity of places there  but fourk was delicious  my steak and eggs were honestly amazing  the value for the dish is high  and i would highly recommend both the venue and the meal 
authenic flavor  cozy environment  great restaurant    tried the place when we first moved to charlotte  it has become a regular place especially on taco tuesday  they serve some of the best guacamole ive ever tasted  highly recommend this place
wow  who knew this place was even here and free on thursdays   stumbled upon this museum today while walking an alternate route in the scottsdale civic center mall  i am so glad i came in to check it out   currently theres a kahil joseph exhibit w his film  two screens side by side show video footage depicting life in compton paired with kendric lamars music make the experience pretty powerful  really unique  gift shop has some cool stuff too  including  eracism  t shirts   friendly  helpful staff that offer free tours of all the contemporary exhibits  nice that you can spend as much or as little time in here and dont have to feel guilty with free admission all day on thursdays  also free on fridays and saturdays after 5pm    relatively small museum but its the perfect place to check out and get a nice reprieve from the heat 
standard olive garden which is nice because you know exactly what youre getting  a ok food and service  ordered ahead and still had to wait   but it was prime dinner  pickup rush hour so i guess thats to be expected    wish they had curbside pickup or specific pickup parking like a lot of other chain restaurants provide to convenience customers 
went in with high hopes for our date night after reading the reviews and looking up the menu online  unfortunately the food just wasnt amazing  especially for the price    beautiful decor and ambience  we went at night so we didnt get to see the green grass and golf course but i can imagine its impressive during the day  service was also great and our waiter did a good job engaging with us and provided his personal favorite dishes as well    unfortunately  the taste of the food wasnt as spectacular as the ambience  we ordered two sushi rolls   the angry tuna roll and the seared salmon roll  at first i liked the seared salmon roll the best because of its unique flavor  after a few bites  the smokiness of the chipotle aioli became a bit too overpowering for me  i did really enjoy the angry tuna roll  we split the snapper entree  which our server explained is one of their most popular dishes  it looked pretty and they did a nice job splitting it onto two beautifully presented plates  it just tasted so fishy    we tried to cover the flavor by wrapping the snapper in the provided warmed tortilla with avocado and the onion  tomato slaw  but the fishiness still permeated  by the end we were dipping it in left over soy sauce from our sushi to cover the taste   yuck  i couldnt even finish it  now ive had snapper before and its a bit fishy but this was very fishy  maybe we just got a bad fillet because i cant imagine this dish being anyones favorite  we didnt complain and we just dealt with it   but i dont think well be ordering snapper anytime in the near future    for dessert we ordered the chocolate cake to split  from the description it looked like a very rich dish and it was    unfortunately it was dry and leas decadent than i had anticipated from the description  we didnt end up finishing it  the best part of dessert was the tea served with a teapot full of warm water  honey  and variety of delightfully flavored tea bags    we still enjoyed our date night because the service and ambience were great  we probably wont return because the food wasnt as delicious and amazing as we had hoped 
i am not vegan and this place is legit  i have driven past numerous times before venturing into this  health  spot  one day  after being sick for a few weeks  i thought id be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold  man was i in for a treat and it has since become a favorite spot of mine   still a skeptic  i thought to myself   i better try this place a few times before writing a review   now that ive been several times  i feel like i can truly vouch for this place  i cant believe their meatless dishes are so delicious and flavorful  so far  i have tried the following    hangry tacos   really good  not the largest portion but still a good size  i was full after eating this dish  they looked dry and unappealing but dont let that discourage you from biting in and experiencing all the flavor   raw tree of life salad    huge   enough to split  so many interesting flavors  i prefer it with their vinaigrette over the tahini dressing   portobello cheese steak sandwich    i was truly a skeptic of this dish and almost didnt try it  i am so glad i did  it is by far my favorite dish and i cant wait to order it again   most of the juices i tried were primarily selected to help me get over a cold and were full of ginger  beets  carrots  and a few other vitamin c packed fruits  veggies  if you want a sweet  yummy juice  the blue pom bomb is really tasty  they can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what youre looking for     which brings me to their service  i am so impressed  all the staff i encountered were super friendly and willing to answer any of my questions  they provided excellent recommendations and because of this  i have tried great dishes i wouldnt have selected on my own    i also like the layout of this place and its always clean  they even have a cute  little  comfy corner nook with seating if you want to chill  read  or just hangout  its also nice they offer both indoor and outdoor patio seating    even if youre not a health nut  one day when youre feeling adventurous  give this place a shot 
i have walked by this place numerous times and finally had a chance to go inside  they offer free admission but their hours are fairly limited    built in scottsdales first school house  the museums friendly volunteers explained the structure of the building is original and the roof was replaced more recently  you can walk through the small exhibit in about 10 to 15 minutes  it includes an example of an old classroom  one thing that was pretty neat was the display of the original rules school house teachers had to abide by  back in the day  they were pretty intense and crazy strict  especially for female teachers     the two elderly volunteers were very friendly and eager to tell you all about scottsdale history  a  for enthusiasm   i wouldnt make a special trip to this place but if you happen to be walking along scottsdale mall and stumble upon it while they are open  stop in and check them out 
this place has a great ambience  they even have a dj during busy weekend brunch hours  extra bonus  strong  flavorful coffee  although we didnt try it  they have an extensive  impressive bloody mary bar  husband tried the house sangria and said it was the perfect blend of sweet and strong    in terms of food  so many delicious looking options  if you like seafood try their lump crab frittata or lump crab sweet potato hash    both were excellent  we also split a 1  2 order of apple pie pancakes and they were delicious  a 1  2 order comes with two large pancakes and is plenty  especially if you just want a taste of sweet along with your full savory meal    if youre looking for a fun brunch environment this is your spot  do expect a wait during the busy brunch hours 
ive been to this location a few times and im not sure why i keep returning  maybe because the service is usually pretty good and others im with want to come here  my food is always blah  but this last time it was horrible   i got the steak and ribs  ugh   both were so dry and overcooked  even the baked potato was just ok and pretty dry  salad was decent because how do your really mess up a caesar salad  the best part of the meal was their famous bread    our server was a sweetheart and im sure if i had complained she wouldve taken the food off the check  but i didnt want to make a fuss because a   i didnt feel like being that girl and b   honestly im just not convinced the quality of the food is very good  pretty sure this will be my last visit here  unless i have to attend an event like a bday party or something that requires me to come back 
i highly recommend taking a good friend to la casa narcisi  my partner and i had a lovely time tasting wines and chatting with the gal who served our samples  unlike some winery experiences where it seems the server is on edge waiting for praise  our server helped us to feel laid back by providing natural conversation as a backdrop for our wine critique  our enjoyment of the wine was moderate  many simply tasted immature  while others were surprisingly good  eventually  we were talked into dinner and we were not disappointed  our dinner server  different from our wine pourer  was very sweetly professional  think diner meets upscale   our requests for changes and substitutions to our pizza were no problem at all  my only complaint about the dining portion of our evening is that we didnt get a chiller for our bottle of seyval blanc  but i never did ask for one either  the seyval blanc made for a great table wine  by the way  no interference  clean and crisp yet smooth  we felt at home at la casa narcisi and although the food was excellent  we hope to return in the spring with a picnic basket 
never got to the food because after being seated on a mildly busy friday night  4  20  12  we sat for 15 minutes without being acknowledge by any of the wait staff  the straw that broke the camels back was when the waitress working our area stood next to my wife and took the drink order of a recently arrived guest then walked away  she didnt have the courtesy to even look at us  good news is we left and had a great time at brios just across the street and they got my 25  tip for great service 
everytime i visit dibellas i have a flawless experience  no matter what time of day  how busy  whos working  i always get great service and great food  my go to sub is the god father  hot  on white bread with lettuce tomatoes provolone cheese and oil   and of course that chocolate chip cookie   when you walk in youre facing a long dining area  ordering line  which can be a little concerning when its jammed with people and the lines out the door  but their staff is prompt and efficient  and although sometimes they lack the personality to go with their great service  id rather have quick  quality food than a chatty  overly friendly employee  after all  thats not whats going to satisfy my hunger   and besides  when youre working on getting people in and out and concentrating on orders with no end in sight  id say its expected to feel a little less chatty  and im ok with that  continue to deliver quick service and great food  and ill continue coming back 
my friend recommended this place to me so i tried it out yesterday with a friend for a pedicure  and i loved it   as soon as you walk in you can see that the place it well kept and clean   big plus   its very classy but still comfortable  and from what i experienced  the people working there are really nice   the prices are reasonable and i left totally satisfied   the pedicure was great and i genuinely enjoyed myself   what more can you ask for   i highly recommend this place  and ill definitely be going back for more services 
my parents live in the area so we decided to drop by for lunch on a cold sunday  the restaurant is tiny  we were the only ones there at first but the place filled up quickly after our arrival  the owner was extremely outgoing and friendly  going out of his way to explain the menu and taiwanese culture to us in lots of detail  he enthusiastically told us he was trained by a local celebrity chef in taiwan and showed us the recipes she had published in a magazine  our conversation really piqued our curiosity and by then we were impatient to sample his cuisine    it definitely did not disappoint  the menu is half taiwanese and half japanese  we tried the taiwanese beef noodle soup  which consisted of perfectly al dente udon like noodles chilling in a deep  rich beef broth  the heavenly taiwanese minced pork rice  which tasted like it had been simmering in its juices for hours  crispy japanese almond shrimps  sweet and sour deep fried fish  and some kind of chicken katsu  although the sauce tasted a bit more like teriyaki than the traditional plum sauce  everything was fresh and flavorful  and the fried food was surprisingly not oily at all  i personally preferred the taiwanese dishes because it tasted like the kind of home cooked meals you yearn for once youve left the family nest  but i must admit the fried dishes were very well executed and would delight any tempura fan   we finished the meal with a sample of the pancakes that are only offered on weekends  taro  sweet potato  custard and red bean  it was the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch  i really admired how passionate the owners seemed  and thought it really showed in their cooking  we will definitely be back 
as with the other upwards project restaurants this is a win   it may not be authentic mexican food but it is good    the decor is a lot of fun   the seating is very comfortable   that was the first thing that was mentioned   the booths were big and comfortable with plenty of room   the music is fun and upbeat    now to the food   the chips and salsa are great and they just keep coming   we got the nachos which we could have finished with and had a great night   my mother in law got the vegetarian burrito and said she would love to come back and get some more   my husband and i got the 3 tacos and they were each very good  not authentic but still good   my daughter had had the chicken tacos in the past so decided to have the burrito and ate every bite   if she only kind of likes something she will eat some of it but when she eats the whole thing it means she really likes it   the orange cucumber sale was a big hit   the black beans were ok the rice was not so good   for dessert we had the churros and the banana pudding   my husband knowing full well that i am allergic explained how delicious the pudding is   the churros come with a chocolate sauce that has a hint of spice to it   i have already been there twice and plan on returning 
so i went here today with the family  i must say i am thoroughly unimpressed  i got a taco salad and it came out already cold  even the meat   my husband got a burger and was like meh  my daughter got the green chili soup  took a couple of bites then decided she was full  the uncle liked the pulled pork sandwich ok and the in laws shared some ribs  they too said not so good  the appetizer was okish but the experience wasnt great  all in all i wont suggest this place 
arrived at 5 pm for dinner on a sat night  and we were promptly seated  they do not open a minute before   i was probably a tad underdressed as this is definitely a  nicer  restaurant  i had the veal parm with pasta  food was excellent and a great homemade marinara  but i must say i was a bit disappointed that for  18  my meal came with a choice of pasta or salad  seriously  had to sit there while everyone else ate their salad  which i thought was awkward since we all ordered standard fare entrees  ive never heard of such a thing  and this is the reason for my downgraded review  that said  the service was great  food was fast and the meal was delicious along with the accompanying garlic rolls 
its a good thing i dont live in az or else id be here everyday  best nitro cold brew and avocado toast in town  when i come down for spring training i always drop in  
we had a big business event  approx  50 persona  at bachof  it was really amazing    great service  great location und what was the besteht  food was incredible      enjoy 
never disappointed when i come here   excellent pizza with the freshest ingredients   highly recommend the garlic knots   food is always ready when quoted for take out   service is great  very friendly and helpful staff 
a m a z i n g     i cant say enough good things about this place   i first discovered this lil gem barhopping with a friend of mine and was completely in awe of the whole ambiance of the place   the entrance is a narrow stone stairway that leads down to a small bar area with a couple of booths and seats in front of a fireplace   completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above   we had a drink and went on our way to richardsons next door which was also amazing  but thats a whole other review   my second experience was when my best friend and i planned our birthday dinner with our guys   she made our reservations and requested one of the booths  which we were accomodated with   our server was great  she was friendly and very attentive   we ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer  i had the chicken schnitzel  my best friend had the pork adobada  and the guys both ordered the prime rib   all were delicious   the prime ribs were huge   we had a great time   its a quiet lil hole in the wall bar  restaurant   great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night   i cant wait to go again 
if you want a pic with the coke bear  then here it is  kinda cool if you want a coke from a different country 
smell of chocolate is evident as soon as you walk in  nice store with samples to try on second floor 
we went late one night about 35 minutes before closing  we were the only patrons at that time and were treated very well  the service was excellent as was my wifes chicken teriyaki and my tempura and noodles  if we go back to toronto  we will be sure to go back to this restaurant 
definitely worth seeing while in montreal  you can see an awesome view of montreal while on the top of the mont royal  ive been here before when i was a kid  but now back at it as an adult it was just lovely  get your walking shoes on because in order to enter you have to climb the mountain and the stairway is lengthy  for me wearing a dress that day not the best idea i must say  because whats cool was the fact that they had three separate rows of stairways  the one that stood out to me was the wooden one where youd have to make the climb to the top on your knees which represents the sacrifice our fathers made before us and your taking that journey and if you make a wish and succeed the climb your wish comes true   next time must where jeans lol    saint joseph oratory is huge with 6 levels  1  welcome center votive chapel  brother andres tomb  statue of the virgin  saint joseph oil  crypt church  and hall of renovation project  3  rest area  4 brother andres heart and display on his life  5  the oratory museum  6  basilica  original chapel  saint andre bessette chapel   parking is free if you are a student of the university of montreal or  5 if not and admission is free to the church  however the museum inside is i recall  5 per person   we saw the outdoor garden which depicted christs journey with numerous statues and nice horticulture  it was peaceful and serene  we also saw the museum which housed unique displays of nativity scenes throughout the world which was really cool to see  they also had art sculptures  old town maps of montreal  and beautiful paintings  the chapels and churchs are just amazing 
food was great and our server johanna was amazing  the restaurant was extremely busy on sunday  there was about 20 minutes wait for a table but the the food took awhile to arrive 
so happy about their 3rd location  food is just as good as the original location and about the same amount of seating  if you are looking for good taiwanese food  this is my go to 
great place for cheap sushi  mainly a take out restaurants since they have very limited seating  they offer great rolls  fresh sushi and sashimi  party trays  chirashi  sashimi salad and warm dishes like teriyaki and tempura  everything is good and orders come out quickly  they food is consistent and you get a lot for what you pay  my fave our their rolls 
great family run restaurant near chinatown in a small plaza  the service was good and the food came out quick and hot  we order the pho tai which is rare beef noodle soup   6 95 usd  along with egg rolls   5 95 usd   the broth in the pho was very good and they used thin noodles  there was a lot of green onions  but since i am a fan i didnt mind  the egg rolls were delicious  very crunchy and complimented well with the lettuce wraps  we also ordered the chicken banh mi to go which was very good  the sandwich was packed with meat and vegetables and served on a fresh baguette 
i have been to this location a few times and in the past we did not have the best experience due to poor service  happy to say we had great service this time around  food was good as usual and it came out quickly  we shared the 3 dip appetizer  their hummus and baba ganoush are must orders  and the chicken breat skewers with mashed potato and house salad 
we stumbled on this on our way to ago  and this totally hit the spot on a cold winter night  its a small restaurant and usually there is a short wait   but it is worth it  their japanese curry is so delicious and we will definitely be back 
by far the best chicken wings in vegas   check this place out when you can  the pizzas are also very good and i look forward to checking out the rest of the menu  ps their fries are amazing
horrible horrible service i have been here for over 40 minutes i just got my food numerous people that have come in after we have been served
after falling in love with meat   potatoes  i felt it was only right to give this chef another chance to wow and impress   after anxiously awaiting our reservation for upwards of 2 months  the night finally came and i have to say it was well worth the wait and even lived up to the hype   the restaurant is gorgeous  very gamie  outdoorsy feel to mixed with a almost fine dining decor    for appetizers we tried the dry aged tartar  this was the best variety of this dish i have truthfully ever come across   delightful large pieces of fine quality beef  encrusted with parmesan  black garlic aoli and the best part truffled eggs   put it all together on a piece of the texas style toast served with it and you have a melting genius combination that will leave you salvating   we also really enjoyed their version of mac   cheese  the goat cheese was the real standout here   a sharp variation  creamy and surprisingly complex  for entrees we tried the wagyu flank steak and seared scallops   i have to admit i am no scallop fan but found this dish to be the better of the two  they were absolutely perfectly prepared with a fantastic crunch to top them off  the flank steak was very good but i did feel like i could of picked a better entree to represent the restaurants diversity and expertise  i just think i picked the wrong dish  nothing more   i was satisfied but not wowed by this steak  i dont really understand the whole wagyu craze anyway i would recommend this restaurant to anybody that liked meat and potatoes and likes to stay some what in american comfort food   however this menu is a bit more exotic than m p   service was excellent and knowledgeable as well 
had a great dinner last night at seviche   of course we went for the ceviche as my gf and i are huge fresh raw fish fans and having a love for south american prepared foods i needed to give this a shot   we tried the tradito  fire   ice and sofrito mango preparations   i felt out of the 3 tried the fire and ice had the most traditional and delicious ceviche flavor   alittle spice but nothing crazy and a great overall fresh  cold base too it   the tradito was a little plain for me and just tasted like ahi tuna with olive oil and some spices   the sofrito mango preparation was great aswell  served tartar style with plantain chips for dipping  would recommend also not to fruity at all         i underestimated how much i would enjoy their 2 for  20 tacos  and i nailed the choices on that one  the carnitas were amazing   very tender and moist and just enough spice   the tortilla was toasted very nice aswell   enjoyed the bbq short rib taco aswell   i would go back and stick to the small offerings like ceviche and tacos but none of the entrees really captured my interest   i also enjoyed a pisco sour and red sangris  the sangria was one of the better ive had 
i absolutely loved to atmosphere here  although we didnt go up to the rooftop bar which is apparently awesome  we ordered the truffle fries for an app   really enjoyed them  my sister ordered two cocktails   both tasted like cough syrup  that was the only part of the dinner that came up short  we ordered the shepherds pie   it reminded me of something my mom would make  which is def a good thing  very comforting  last but not least  we got the chocolate car bomb for dessert which was amazing  overall we had a great experience   will be coming back soon to try the salmon 
cracker barrel is consistently delicious   comforting  breakfast is always my first choice here  you cant beat it  and i love the old fashioned decor  one of my fav places to eat 
we visit here periodically and tend to enjoy the food  service always seems a challenge here   getting to the part where you can start to eat the meal seems to be difficult for this location  when ordering the entree and request extra asian slaw with it  you expect there to be slaw on it as well as extra on the side  when you request a side of pickled ginger  you expect to receive it  when you order appetizers then entrees  you expect appetizers first  before the entree  when the server spills the edemame salt on the table next to you and it lands on you and your clothes  you expect an apology and offer to clean it up  in this case  my wife and i ordered the same entrees except hers was supposed to have extra slaw on the side   then the aforementioned events occurred    i hesitate recommending this location because of the inability of the staff to get the order correct the first time 
my party of five went here on saturday afternoon  it was a sports grill atmosphere with tvs playing sports and loud conversations all around me  thankfully  we broke the monotony and were loudest of all   we had a great time  our waitress was very patient with us as we sampled many spirits and appetizers  i really enjoyed being here more so than the one over in santan village  the artichoke dip is amazing  also  we ordered medium wings and they tasted fantastic  that may be the spirits talking  but were definitely coming back either way 
possibly the best indoor mall in arizona  lots of good stores  no vacant spaces  decent food court  but if you want to see and be seen  head to  cottsdale fashion  quare mall
a few of my girlfriends and i stayed at the hotel last month  we were all super excited because it was our first time when we first saw the room it was spacious and elegant the decor was beautiful and plenty of space for the four of us to get ready   the first day we were having some issues with the drains not going down in our bathroom and kitchen sink  after notifying the front desk  management did not step in to address the pluming issue nor did maintenance  we called housekeeping the second day for restocks on towels toothpaste and other necessities  i asked them if they knew the problem to our drains not going down and turns out that our drains were locked from the previous guest that was staying in our hotel room    now thats the least of my worries      on our second day we decided to order room service for lunch i believe we ordered a blt with a side of salad and fresh fruit  i picked at the fruit to pick out a blackberry and you wont believe what i found     a live worm    i was disgusted     called front desk immediately and notified them about the worm squirming around in our food  somebody eventually came up and took a look at the food and told hotel management    we went down and showed her pictures and videos of the worm and she apologized but also said that  mistakes do happen all the time    yes we did get our money back for our meal because obviously we didnt eat it       i had such high expectations for cosmo and wish that i had a better stay  to be honest i dont think i would ever stay here again   very disappointed
performances were all good  however im not too sure if i liked the atmosphere  dont get me wrong  im not the party type nor i like loud music  the atmosphere here was just    too quiet  the crowds were older and everyone was really quiet  to enjoy the music which is understandable   but it was to the point even if i whispered some words or pick up my fork to grab a bite  they will all look at me  my friend and i ended up texting to each other whenever it is needed to avoid the crowds judging us    pub food is well  pub food   decent but wasnt that bad   edit  drinks werent strong to my taste  but could have been human error when creating the mix  edit    crunchy coconut shrimp   11 95  the coconut crust to be a bit too thick and the chilli in the mayo was undetectable  otherwise the shrimps were sweet and juicy  while the coconut crust was crispy without being greasy    bruschetta  tomato  basil   parmesan on a warm baguette     6 95 while the baguette was soft and cheesy with the slightly melted parmesan  perhaps some prosciutto would have been nice for a bit of a crunchy texture    turkey sliders  3 housemade turkey burgers with cranberry mayo and crispy fried onions     12 95 the turkey patty was dry and  i actually informed the owner about it  however he didnt seem happy when he heard about it   the sauce didnt have that distinct cranberry flavor that i expected either and overall i wasnt too happy with the dish    ravioli  spinach   ricotta ravioli with marinara sauce     13 95 the ravioli were rubbery with a grainy cheese filling  and i found the marinara sauce to be underwhelming    i dont have a name burger  6 oz  of beef  avocado  blue cheese  swiss cheese and sour cream     15 95 unlike the slider  the beef patty was perfectly medium rare and blue cheese wasnt as overpowering as i would have thought 
 the cafe is next to the original cheesecake store  inside there is a door which connect both bakeries    the main focus of this cafe is matcha dessert  but some items also have red beans as well     the small portion of the shaved ice was humongous  it can be easily shared between 2 people  unfortunately i didnt feel like having the shaved ice as the weather was quite chilly        mixed matcha and milk soft cream in a cup    3 99  the soft serve was a slight disappointment  in my opinion the vanilla  milk taste overpowered the green tea  i think even if i get the matcha flavored only  the matcha taste wouldnt have been strong enough   furthermore  i found that within 2 minutes  the soft serve was already melting  do note i was eating this in a 20 degrees weather with no sun out  so i dont even want to imagine how fast the soft serve will melt when torontos weather get to 30 degrees  which i doubt it will lol    matcha madeleine    2 22  each i prefer the matcha over the original madeleine these madeleines have a nice crust  soft interior with a strong green tea flavor  i also appreciate that these had a nice balance of sweet and bitterness from the green tea  it would goes very well with a nice cup of latte    
3 5  5   the term bac ky is actually a derogatory term for people from northern vietnam  like me   im not offended by any means and apparently the owners picked that term to pay tribute to their parents  who came to canada from a city in northern vietnam   quite strange    the menu was pretty basic for any vietnamese restaurants with a few options for each categories  i was surprised to see that everything is priced under  10  which is really rare for a restaurant in king street west     shrimp fresh roll    5 the roll was well made and refreshing with lettuce  bean sprouts and the carrots were slightly tangy  the fish sauce was disappointing as it was extremely watered down  a bit more fish sauce and few slices of red chilies would do the trick      bun rieu  vermicelli noodles  chicken soup broth  fresh tomatoes  dried tofu  crab meat balls made with ground pork  egg  crab paste     8 80 it was way much better than the one i had at banh mi bar  it was light and not too oily along with stewed tomatoes that contributed a slightly tart and natural sweetness to the dish  however the soup was a bit salty for my taste and there was too much broth for the amount of noodles and meat in the dish  i also found that since the soup had been modified to be healthier  the broth doesnt have as much depth of flavor as the ones i had in vietnam  but i supposed this will have to do if you are craving for bun rieu and unwilling to travel outside of toronto 
 there is no ventilation in this place so you gonna walk out smelling like korean food    bad service but thats to be expected anyways    food is decent for a 24 hours joint    my fav dishes were the bulgogi stew and the short ribs  incredibly flavorful stew and the short ribs were perfectly medium rare    pass the kimchi stew  bland and kimchi was not sour enough 
super expensive for what it is  i ordered a sandwich and it was super tiny for  5   check my pix  jeez  i can still order an entire sandwich for that price in those hippie cafes back in toronto lol  taste was meh  nothing to write home about    the latte was overly sweetened  like someone just dumped sugar in it  ordered another drink   milky way and it was still too sweet    fine i like the decor but terrible drinks wont make up for it 
3 5  5   the restaurant was spacious and spotless  i liked how they had a big sink at the front with sensors so you wouldnt have to use the washroom and dirtied the handles    there were bibs  paper towels and plastic gloves on the table    service was average  not the most attentive     i would not come back to captains boil on a regular basis as its quite expensive     lobster   29 95  and shrimp   12 95  in captains boil sauce   the lobster was cut lengthwise  and both the shrimp and lobster were cooked perfectly  while i understand the concept of the restaurant was to use your hands  but at some point it was extremely difficult to eat the lobster without lobster crackers  half way through eating we also realized that there was no where to put the trash  empty shells    while the captains boil sauce was supposed to be the combination of all three sauces  the garlic was overwhelming  i love garlic but this was way too much and the sauce was under seasoned for our taste  i also thought the shrimps had much more sauce and flavor compared to the lobster  perhaps the shrimp was smaller hence the sauce was able to penetrate easier   half way through i decided to order the cajun fries  i thought the fries were quite crispy and fluffy on the inside  but it felt very   powdery  they could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries as it seemed they were just sprinkled on top 
3 5  5    the restaurant is gorgeous and perfect for a date night    some of the dishes really needed some final touches to make them perfect   a bit expensive for the portion that we received    our server was friendly however she was pretty much overworked  the host was there just to look pretty and didnt bother to even check for our desserts when we asked  it arrived 45 minutes late         pappardelle pasta  lamb ragu  sweet peas  tomatoes  mint     16   the pappardelle was slightly under cooked for both of us and i wished there was more sauce as the lamb ragu was just perfect   very hearty with melted in your mouth lamb pieces and seasoned perfectly  my favorite    bavette     nero scoglio  scallop  squid  clams  mussels     26   on the menu this dish was actually made with fettucine pasta  however it was sold out that day so the server offered me a different type of pasta    for  26 the portion was quite small  however the pasta was al dente and you can tell via vai make their own pasta in house  there were a decent amount of seafood for  26 and they were cooked perfectly  however the tomato sauce was lacking in flavor and the whole dish was bland  so it was quite disappointing as i was really looking forward to this dish       honey panna cotta    7   it was pretty good  the panna cotta had the right texture and the tangy fruits helped to cut down the sweetness from the honey    tiramisu    7  i didnt like the biscotti as it was dry and tough to eat  the tiramisu had a strong espresso and chocolate flavor and the taste was just pure heaven  surprisingly the base of the tiramisu was a sponge cake instead of lady fingers  which i didnt mind as i found the tiramisu still held up really well  i also liked how there wasnt too much mascarpone so the dessert wasnt too rich nor sweet  and i didnt think the raspberry sauce was needed
had breakfast here   it was very clean and the people were friendly   it seemed like a great place to bring kids   the deserts at the front counter looked very good    i ordered corned beef hash with scrambled eggs   everything was average   i tried my sons pancakes and they were also average  i would like to come back to try dessert 
great craft beers   try the havartti  and ham sandwich  its awesome 
since moving away from madison  eldorado is one of those restaurants i miss  the atmosphere is nice   tex mex meets modern design  very hip    in regards to the food  dinner entrees dont really stick out  what i do continue to crave  however  is the brunch menu  i love the blue corn pancakes  highly recommended  i also recommend you wash them down with a mimosa   my early morning empty tummy misses you  eldorado 
the shamrock is a gay madison institution  its often the same people  year after year  actually  but thats whats so fun about it  its predominantly men  but when the ladies take over  its always a really good time   ive seen it all at shamrock  dancing  signing  rubbing up against another   some of which i could have done without seeing  shamrock is friendly  welcoming  and comfortable  theres reason it is such a staple in gay madison 
five below is exactly as the name states     5 and below  its better than the dollar store by far  but not as cute as daiso    and has a variety of everything  sports gifts   cards  gift wrap  nail supplies  clothes  plushies  stickers  toys  electronic accessories  candies  you name it  they have some hello kitty and steelers merch  great shop to find basic necessities for a cheap price 
being that this is the only  kawaii  merchandise store in the entire state of pennsylvania   its definitely something new to you all  it was a refresher to finally see this emerge when i had been collecting many things online  i liked the large variety here but its for sure overpriced lol  ebay is much cheaper and asian markets all over california sell tons of this stuff without costing ten arms and legs  i occasionally bought items from here that i like so i dont wait for shipping  pens are overpriced  i mean 9 dollars for a pencil geez  i can buy that from japan for like  4  they indeed sell lovely products and its always my favorite shop but ive experienced much better  to a pennsylvanian though  this is all you got  its better than nothing  and its also great for small gift ideas  
great place  the receptionist was super nice  and their prices are the best   they have a cute house cat who is super friendly  too 
good food but only got 2 out of 3 pizzas  slow service  wanted to close so would not serve beer  had an hour before they were closing 
i have been going to bestbuy for years now  i purchased my first laptop from this location  good customer service  knowladgable staff and clean place 
tried a gluten free pizza  it wasnt bad at all  i couldnt eat all of the crust  as it was getting a little much  but didnt mind it overall 
great staff  food is very consistent  defiantly the place to go to if you are craving butter and cinnamon  located upstairs by the food court so you can multitask your meals 
super clean  affordable and nice   i was looking for a new nail place on my new side of town and came across danas nails and i was very pleased  i will definitely return  they even had complimentary water bottles which is always a nice touch 
super good and super affordable  not to mention the whole staff is super nice and welcoming  they actually seem like they enjoy there job  you can create your own pizza for one flat fee and its like 7 65 even with six toppings  i will definitely be a returning customer   not to mention when they cook it they get it to you in under 5 minutes  fast  affordable and friendly staff  what more could you want 
oysters were tiny but deep  it was delicious but too small for the price    ramen was delicious  so good  i say its a must get here  worth every sip 
went on a saturday afternoon around 4 00pm for dinner  hungry because wed skipped lunch  walked in not sure if they were even open  because it looked empty and there was no host  but a bartender then addressed us  a wedding party was taking photos in the main pub  dining area  so we were seated in the side room  which was fine  just one other table occupied    i ordered the irish stew  because the steak pie could not be made without stilton since it was pre made  and i dislike stilton   it arrived and looked like a bowl of watered down gravy  i could not see any chunks of meat or vegetables at all  just a smooth liquid surface in the bowl  dipping my spoon in  i did find 3  1 inch chunks of meat  a few potato chunks  and carrots cut so large i needed to use my knife to eat them  flavour was fine  but this was a scant soup  not a rich and hearty irish stew  it was nothing like the stew photo i see posted by yelper teresa y   my date ordered the fish and chips  the fries were cold  and the two pieces of fish were the exact same size and shape   definitely not battered in house   and they were wrapped in a green paper wrap with a glossy newspaper insert rather than a piece of newspaper  they were going for authenticity  but really failed  no tartar sauce was provided  either   needless to say  a very disappointing meal  we went over to ikea and had a couple of 75 cent hot dogs because we were still hungry    2 stars because it tasted alright and the server was friendly 
its a fun spot  especially great for dates when you dont want to be fancy  food and drink selection is good  service is typically very professional  great location  all around positive experience 
it was decent   they messed up my order slightly  but overall i will try them again   they were though  very quick on delivery  which i appreciated 
they are quick  friendly and knowledgeable  i paid a good price for getting my iphone 6 plus cracked screen repaired  to top it off they added a screen protector for  10  it took about 30 minutes if not shorter  i recommend coming here for their exceptional service 
i love these acai bowls  i start my day off right with the frozen concoction of blended fruit topped with granola  fresh fruit and of course honey   the girls are really sweet who work here and ive lost a ton of holiday baggage with thrive 
sandwiches at jimmys place   with a nice hangover and a belly that needed to be reload of normal food  we headed over to jimmy johns for some much needed sustenance   now ive been to jj before and ive had a few great experiences but this time i was a little disappointed  ordering the beach club sandwich i found the bread to be dry  a little unusual but meh i plowed on  getting through the sandwich i really found it to be really bland and not to the jj standards that i had experienced before    maybe it was a off day for jj and myself but i will try them again but i wont go out of my way when you got quite a few good places in such close proximity    
with vegas full of corporate chains ie mcdonalds  pizza hit  subway etc it was finally refreshing to find a place like rachels kitchen  the menu is full of great healthy fresh options which are hard to find in las vegas  the service is always great but when it is a little busy it might take a little longer to get your meal  any of the juice options can be a little strong if its your first time trying them    i recommend this place if your looking for an healthy alternative to the regular places
time for a four legged haircut   periodically i bring my italian greyhound here to get his hair cut  nails filed and gland fixed up  this is not a bad little groomer  its tucked away next to red rock running co  along west cheyenne     darcys is pretty effective when dealing with trouble little makers like my hulk of 9 lbs  i usually just drop him off in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon  each dog has there own little kennel so no real fighting happens  they do except appointments but i have found the drop off method always best   everything is cash here  also make sure to ask what the price is  the groomers never really tell you till its time to pay  also handy hint  if you forgot cash  just head over to the magoos  they have a atm   overall cleanliness  3 5 service  3 5 price  2 5 come back  yeah why not
 bumping up a star   why   the service is personable   dishes are consistent    easy to call in for take away   very clean restaurant    plenty of parking   mykonos delivers what your looking for in greek food  if your wondering  go try it out
who doesnt love thai food thats open till 5 am in vegas  sometimes live music  they actually make the food spicy  i usually order papaya salad  basil  and cashew chicken  quite tasty  service is usually solid and quick  good atmosphere  wish theyd build one in henderson  probably my fav thai spot in vegas 
cool spot at the container park  nice staff  samples  bought several packs  some tasty flavors  good stuff  local company 
the worse customer service in my entire life  i am literally trying to give you money and you still cannot help me  i am trying to upgrade to an iphone 6  20 days early because my battery life after the new update sucks  i have made 5 phone calls to the 800 number in which i got 5 different answers  they keep telling me the store had to do the override  i am gladly trying to pay them a  35 early fee for doing nothing and they still wont take it  they say the 800 number has to note it and the 800 number says the store has to note it on my account  so not only do they not want  199 for the phone plus  35 fee and my  100 a month business  fine  i will gladly go to verizon after all these years 
this location is 10x times better than town square  plus we had an amazing waitress  good job and keep it up 
i love that they have this store in town square  it makes it a lot faster trip than going to plant hollywood  the girls that work there are helpful  but what i love about this place is their return policy  if you do not like the product you can return it  fast   easy  no questions asked  you should pick up a dior lipstick addict while your there  my favorite  lol
the grilled chicken sandwhich was horrible  the mac n cheese gave me the runs  im definitely not going back here    
before i visited sliders i had been so disappointed in burgers around gta in general that i stopped even trying to find any new places well over a year ago  but what do you know  theres life on mars    out of four different sliders  the classic one  the mushroom spiked version of the latter  the parmesan cheese chicken and the spicy jerky chicken  i tried during my first but definitely not last visit id have to call the mushroom version a winner  though they were all pretty awesome   the specialty spicy sauce went very well with the beef burgers  and tzatziki is just what you need to cut through the spicy chicken  the chilli   cheese fries didnt disappoint either  and the size of a large potion simply blew my mind  beware  its humongous and it has lots of beans to boot   on top of all that goodness the place sells beers and its open till midnight  always the time i have the worst cravings   i mean what else can you ask for 
my first time coming here  the lady   owner helping me gave excellent customer service from answering my question on the phone to processing my order when i came in  was craving a chocolate cake and they had a variety to choose from  most other bakeries closes at 6pm  will definitely come again and try other pastries  oh and free coffee and cookie with check in  thank you manan bakery   d
been coming here since i got new wheels and they do a great job keeping my car looking new 
picked up some goodies here for my moms dog  employees here were friendly   we loved to see the other dogs shopping with their people   
fabulous quality antiques  mainly 100  year old items   this antique store has been around for many years  previously on central   camelback   this smaller shop seems to have chosen the top sellers from that previous spot   glassware  art  jewelry  and mirrors are plentiful   the harder to find colors of depression glass are on display here  lovely inspiration for your home decorating   the style is traditional overall but some mid century pieces can be found here   the shop keepers always have a greeting   offering to help   they will mill around periodically to take your purchases to the front or open a case   one time i had a few  yes  items at the counter  noticed one had a tiny nick and decided against it and the gentleman said i have it for free as it was from his booth   pro tip  feel free to make an offer if you are considering more than 1 item from the same dealer number  they will call the dealer who will most likely accept around 20  off 
native arizonan here  we love mexican food    mexican food is my chicken soup  my default no fail friend  since i started driving i was eating carne asada burritos around town as my go to sustenance   vaqueros is all the good things i need in a fast mexican place  dual drive through  large menu  horchata  red or green hot sauce  crispy tacos piled with shredded cheese    my favorite is the carne asada burrito  served super hot   also the shredded beef tacos are awesome   ive gotten a combo with an enchilada before and both times the cheese inside was not melted   also the chicken taco has a nice garlic flavor but not shredded chicken but diced    the drive through girl is super nice   she recognizes her customers which is appreciated by regulars 
like chipotle  but mediterranean food    the hubby and i came in on a tuesday night  i got the chicken plate which basically includes everything on the bar from salad to taboulieh  hummus  olives  pita  so yummy  the flavors of everything were great and i loved the cilantro sauce and tzatziki sauce   the hunny got the chicken pita and really liked the flavor of the red chili sauce   the employees were very nice  as we were eating they checked on us and asked if we liked our food 
happy hour    whats not to like   super cheap appetizers with  6 wine  yes please  we visited bungalow with a large group and sat inside in the raised area   we had decent service and no empty glasses   we tried the grilled cheese sandwich which was basic  white bread and buttery goodness   nothing overly outstanding but still a solid spot to bring a crowd 
my mother in law got very sick and had to cancel her appointment for her initial check up   we were told that because the appointment was canceled less than 24 hours prior to her appointment  she was fined  25 00  what would they want us do  drag my sick mother in law across town just to make her appointment  this clinics priority is making money and not the welfare of its patients   the individuals answering the phone are callous and unsympathetic  avoid this clinic  go somewhere else    
i have always had great service  but i dont always know what im ordering  margarita flights are fun  huevos rancheros   or ranch eggs   are delightful  this place is totally awesome if youre willing to take a step out of your comfort zone 
food is great when work pays for it   i got it delivered to my house once  the driver parked in my  angry  neighbors driveway  i ordered buffalo wings with bleu cheese and they gave me ranch  yuck   i sent them a message about my disappointment  both through their website and good old e mail  no response and no remorse    ill never ever turn down a delicious angelos morsel  but i sure as heck will never pay for it again 
my wife and i have dined at this restaurant 3 or 4 times  and every time it has not disappointed  the staff is friendly and not pushy  want to drop a ton of money  they will allow you  just want to have a couple glasses of wine and share an entree  they will serve you with a smile    last time we were there we had a nice bottle orvieto that cost  35  my wife and i had the carpaccio which was perfect  rounded out the meal with some mussels and clams  and a spicy pasta    you can sit outside and check out all the casino action without feeling like you are sitting in the middle of the casino    i will be going back 
we were extremely disappointed with our visit  the place looks like it was styled for the late 80s  but we tried to look past that since we were pretty hungry   while the service was alright  the kitchen seemed to have hit a snag and we waited for our food for 30 45 minutes  all the tables around us all seemed to have to same issue  the food was bland and heavy in onions and peppers  rice was the typical bland rice with peas  not very fresh or noteworthy  i had the carnitas tacos and my husband had a chimichanga  we both left feeling disappointed and wishing it was so much more   we didnt get a chance to check out any margaritas  but wish we did since the water tasted funny    almost moldy   glad we checked out the local place  but disappointed it wasnt better 
my first time coming to this salon and i absolutely love it  clean atmosphere and the employees are all very friendly  im a bit wary on the polish selection  as its obvious that they have all been thinned with acetone  that being said  my pedicure was great and only  30  i will definitely be back 
a strong five star from me     pros   menu flavors execution service  cons  ambiance  can be crowded  surely a gem   i enjoyed a chicken breast combo with a chocolate turtle doughnut   grapefruit mimosa doughnut with a cold brew    my friend   i chatted for over an hour and the staff cleared our plates and even took a photo of us together   great doughnut flavors   
my new bff ashley helped me out by refilling my propane tanks   she saw me park near the area and came right over with the key    complimenting my necklace  relating about man problems  admiring a bmw  we are two peas in a pod   not only that  she lifted the full tanks into my trunk   muscles   i saw the 1 star reviews and realized i had to recognize the friendly customer service from ashley   thank you 
great dinner date night spot   nice modern but cozy spot near pv  we came in at 9 pm reservation but would have been fine not to have a reservation at that time   we were seated on the far west wall booths  was not too loud in the restaurant as it was not very busy   i had the blanche royale margarita which is the house blood orange margarita with chambord and the hubs had a beer   once he tried my margarita he said he wished he had gotten a marg too    we started with the chorizo mushrooms and that was a great bite   loved the 6 yummy mushrooms and bread to soak the oil up   unfortunately the bread didnt seem fresh  it wasnt crusty or soft  just really tough   id appreciate a lighter toast    or a grilled rustic bread instead    we got the chefs vegetable selection which was delicious  very light and straightforward  lightly seasoned fresh ingredients included roasted cauliflower  lentils  quinoa  arugula  brocolini  grilled bok choi  and a raw fennel   apple salad   the cooked ingredients were delicious but the fennel   apples would have greatly been enhanced with a light vinegarette or perhaps a dressing on the side of the tray  the plain arugula did not annoy me as much but still would have benefitted from a dipping sauce option   we also had the farm salad i think it was   i remember the chewy bacon and creamy dressing   overall good but not outstanding   our server was very nice and professional   we most likely will be back again to sample more menu items 
 service department review   i brought my car in after i got a dead battery and auto zone said it could be the alternator   i arrived at 7 am with no appointment and was greeted immediately in the service drive and a service advisor welcomed me and got my info   he noted on the paper i was waiting   about 20 minutes after waiting he comes back and asks if im the second owner on the car    which i tell him no i bought it at the bell dealership   he says  when i put in your vin it says eric so and so  which i say he must have a typo    after 40 more minutes he comes back with my battery quote  8 over auto zone with  68 to install   i told the service advisor  larry that he is putting me in an awkward spot since that is a ridiculous fee to install the battery since auto zone is cheaper   he says  well guess you shoulda done that  and then even said  well who is going to install it     im pretty sure everyone knows autozone will install batteries  why does larry have to treat me like im completely ignorant   he made my jaw drop at his comments and his lack of customer service   id hate to see him negotiating an actual substantial service bill    less than 5 minutes later im at auto zone on 3rd st   camelback with a nice guy installing my  8 cheaper battery for no charge   everyone knows  dont get serviced at the dealership  
love this store selection  employees helpful but not trying to sell you   ever since i found this store years ago ive been a loyal customer   i love the self service aspect to try on as many shoes as you want without feeling guilty   great prices   rewards  
still not a huge fan but i used to be even less of a fan before this last trip   got dragged here by a friend and at least now they are trying to make a few healthier options   chicken still tasted really fake and salty and still dont plan to come back but not all terrible 
the location is great  the staff present as competent   the issue is the office presents to care more about payment arrangements even if they botched what you went there to fix  i felt like i was at a car dealership  in addition the arrangements that were set up were botched by them all the way past the last payment   i do not recommended this dentistry  inept accounting self serving charities and less than optimum treatment overshadow some good staff  since dental care is expensive i would rather pay for care and not glitz wrapped in kindness 
long time reader of cibo reviews  first time diner and now writer   our group of 4 headed there saturday night  and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights   we arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar  a plus   nimbus beer from tucson   and a  5 glass of pinot grigio    before being seated outside in about 20 minutes     our waiter was super friendly and helpful  suggesting the indecisive bf order half prosciutto crudo and half salsiccia   the rest of us ordered the margherita   i know  i know  original   more points to the waiter  who didnt look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her margherita sans the cheese  also  there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only  and was on top of refilling our glasses   and for me  that was every 5 minutes     we started with the caprese salad  which was different but oh so delicious   the cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto  oregano  and olive oil and were very flavorful   great with the mozzarella   i couldve used more basil leaves or arugula  but whatev    the pizzas were mmmmm  mmmmm good but didnt blow me away   again  i couldve used more basil leaves  but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off  so again  personal preference     i would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of cibo  as well as the friendly staff and owners   definitely a downtown treat  
my husband and i were really  really disappointed with our experience at coulter infiniti   we brought our 2006 g37 with barely 34 000 miles  and out of warranty  to have the moon roof looked at   the moon roof wouldnt open or close  but you could hear the motor working   after leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track   which would cost over  3000   we contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered  due to the fact that its a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty   we were flat out denied   twice     we were dreading the big repair  and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop  which will get a big  fat 5 star review  for a second opinion   turns out the track just had a build up of dirt and debris and needed to be cleaned out   seriously      just over  100 later we were on our way   i find it very hard to believe that coulter didnt know this was the problem   we are now searching for a new suv  and will not be choosing infiniti   how disappointing 
after feeling that nagging feeling that i need to get an oil change one of these days  i finally had time to swing by this jiffy lube after a morning workout   i showed up at 7 15am  saw they had a light on  and went right in   turns out they dont open til 7 30am  but they were friendly about my earlier arrival and told me theyd be with me as soon as they finished opening the store     right at 7 30am they got my car in  serviced it  and i was out in about 20 mins   i was made aware of additional service needed  with no pressure   a big plus for me    i hate pressure     definitely a quick  friendly place to get an oil change 
this hidden  beautiful  delicious restaurant is exactly why i l o v e yelp   last week the boyfriend suggested we go on a  date  and try something new  but preferably in tempe since thats where we would be shopping prior   nothing came to mind  so i browsed yelp and found classic italian pizza   it was love at first read     thanks to the prior reviews we were able to find it by searching for the big lots sign  and were greeted by a mostly vacant parking lot   there  in the corner  the restaurant was glowing and inviting   upon entering we were surprised to find only 3 other tables full  and this was a friday night   yippee   no wait     we started with the yummy brick oven bread  caprese salad  a glass of pinot grigio  and warka  polish beer     which all came out quickly   the bread held up to its expectations   it was the perfect texture of chewy dough and light flavor  brought with a plate of marinara sauce and balsamic   next it was on to the pizza   margharita for me and pepperoni for the boyfriend   both were yummy  hot  and flavorful   every table has its own bottle of olive oil  balsamic  parmesean  and red pepper so we were able to spice our pizzas up just how we like   mmmm   for me  its not only about the food its about the ambiance and this place definitely has both   its cozy  pleasant  and when youre there you really feel like someone invited you to be in on the secret 
has it really been a year   well  back again for our carbo loading pre half marathon dinner     our reservation was at 5 15pm and we were seated right away   this time  i knew there was salami in the salad so i asked for a small one without   it didnt seem to be a problem and i got a pretty big bowl   another table over there were a couple of vegetarians too  and they asked as well   i guess im selfish in that id like the salad with no salami     i went with the spaghetti marinara  boring i know  and thought the sauce was too sweet   i like a more spicy sauce   everyone else seemed happy with their meals though   service was slow   and our poor waitress seemed overworked   she was literally hustling around  and it didnt help that she forgot a few things     theyre moving to a new location  and ill probably be there at least once to check it out   for carb loading next year  well head somewhere else 
i was assigned the task of finding a place for our team at work to go to do some training and team bonding  and of course i turned to yelp    after reading the reviews and checking out the website  i called and reserved tables in the  villa rosa  room   upon arrival  it was clear that this is a great room to use for such work tasks or meetings   there are 3 tables in there that seat 4 6 people  with doors that can be closed if needed   if you want privacy  reserve the whole room     of course we had to start with some donuts  and i tried my hardest to resist them for as long as possible   several hours later  i dug into a chocolate on chocolate  go big or go home   and it was everything id hoped for   yum   i also had a green tea latte that was the best ive ever tasted     our group stayed for lunch and everyone was happy with their choices  which were big portions for the price   service was fast and pleasant too     i hope to be back to spend another work day here 
in this economy  ive grown to be a fan of never paying full price   hence my visits to arizona mills   i made the mistake long ago of exploring the whole outlet mall  and it made me feel gross   the crowds  the stores      ick   but i did find a diamond in the rough     im in love with saks off fifth   its the best outlet store ever   never buy a full price pair of true religion  seven for all mankind or joes jeans ever again  and they have a couple other brands but those are my fav    go here and get them for right around  100 00    they also have a good selection of dresses  tops  and casual stuff like juicy couture as well as designer shoes and sunglasses    now im the type of person that absolutely hates digging through racks of clothing at marshalls or even nordstrom rack  and it is nothing like that here   the jeans are folded neatly by brand  and everything is well organized and clean   even the dressing rooms   theres a great selection of designer mens clothing as well     also  get on their mailing list because i frequently get an extra 20  off purchases 
still clean and organized  still has great deals  and is still one of my favorite stores in the whole wide world 
i love trying new restaurants when in las vegas   i took one for the team  loving vegetarian wife that i am  and we headed here   we were told the wait was 30 minutes for lunch  but oh no  it was more like 45 mins   i hate that     anywho   we had a really  really friendly waitress and got a great booth with our own television   my husband took forevaaaaa picking a beer  but was impressed by the extensive selection   for food i went with the greek salad  sweet potatoes fries  and a chocolate shake   who wouldve thought that theyd have a delicious greek salad for me to eat       and the sweet potatoes fries were just right   and the chocolate shake   wowsa   i think part of my satisfaction is due to the fact that i never eat fries or chocolate shakes  but still     definitely a good stand by when we return  but im not sure well make this our number one stop   theres too many other places to eat 
im thai and was surprised that they had thai desserts  this place totally hit the spot for me  its a hot pot place  convenient location gets most of the stars for me  it would be ridiculous to expect the best freshest ingredients in this area  i like this place  im not hard to please
i go here to get my korean fix  this is exactly like shopping mall korean food  they could serve shit on plate call it korean and i will eat it because there are no other korean places around    i see stupid ass reviews about service  go to an asian place and expect bad service  just go and eat  i like the food  extra meaty  extra fiber  and it comes out quick  i dont need a smile or peppy service to enjoy my meal  im chinese so if i need some ting i go up to the server station and grab it myself  for  8 a meal  i aint expecting  may i change your socks  service  if i do its a bonus    seriously writing this review is making me hungry  i usually get the spicy chicken plate and the fucking chap chae noodles  if you dont feel like driving all the way to china town for it  come here  excellent place to go before a movie  if youre an asian guy dating a white chick  bring her here  if you think orange chicken is amazing  youll like the flavors here  dont ask for orange chicken   damn orange chicken pisses me off  why  i dont want to get into it    seriously location  location  location  five stars for the amount of protein i get  five stars to taking care of my korean craving  however we all crave korean girls  finally i give 5 stars for having the best sides  ill keep coming here till the day i move closer to china town  in reality if you live in henderson  why the hell would one move by china town  im going to get mugged 
seriously over priced with a very small selection   the store was clean and staff were friendly but ill never go back   while the 2  small  pieces of candy that we had were decent it does not justify the price 
this is an ok airport   i have two issues with it   first issue  if you return a rental car you walk into the terminal on the first floor   the check in is then on the third floor   that would not be that bad except for the fact you then have to go to the second floor for security   that is flawed planning at its finest   second issue  this is a pet peeve of mine  you have to take a train in order to get to your gate   it is just something that annoys me   security can easily back up so check to see if the alternate security point on the third floor is open   there are several food options in the food court area   there is also a decent number of shops   having a rite aid in an airport is a great idea   that is a big plus 
there are not a lot of options for food at 4am at this end of the strip   i was worried we would have to wait forever for our food and the service would be horrible   to my surprise the server was friendly and pretty good   the food was ok and it came out pretty quickly   i ordered chicken strips and fries so it was not too complicated   i would not normally eat here  but for late night food it is just fine 
the truffle fries are excellent   the bone in  filet was very good   the salads and desserts are also yummy   the service was good and the environment was nice 
we were strolling through caesars when someone approached us with a drink deal to try this new champagne bar   the deal was buy one get one so we stepped inside   the atmosphere inside is upscale and cool   it is a small place so there is no room for a dance floor   that can be an upside though   you can actually sit down and have a conversation   it was heavily staffed so we had no problem getting consistent service   some of the staff were clearly still learning  but overall the service was fine   the menus are on ipads   it allows you to scroll through the different drink categories and get additional info on the items you want to know more about   the prices are in line with most of the nicer places in las vegas   overall i think this is a solid place to grab a drink away from the crowds   the decor is nice  but i could not figure out how it all fits together   my biggest concern is the location   i am not sure they can get enough people coming in to survive 
absolutely incredible food and service  easily the best caprese salad ive ever had and the restaurant itself was cozy and intimate with very nice employees  would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for good authentic italian in old montreal 
great place for breakfast when they are not too busy   food is creative and great quality   wish it was table service on those days when the lines are long   would be nice to sit down and have coffee while we wait instead of standing in a long line 
so glad we took a chance and tried this place  the food is awesome  i had the cavatelli alla caserta  simple but decadent with ricotta and thick meat sauce   the service is genuinely friendly and attentive and prices are fabulous for the quality  a great option in the area for those who are craving italian and dont want to settle for the overpriced and underwhelming large chain places in the area 
pretty good food  been here a few times before  ordered the turkey  avocado and bacon sandwich with chips and a drink today  you get chucks of turkey  not slices  which i can take or leave    order came up pretty quickly  clean location with plenty of seating   only downfall is  its pretty expensive for the amount of food you get  i spent  10 95 for a sandwich  small bag of chips and a smedium drink  which i think is kinda absurd   i rarely eat here and i will keep up that trend 
i was originally going to go to another soul food place until i found out they do not have po boys  um  ex squeeze me     so by chance  we saw mama joyces and stopped in   ordered the pork po boy and mac n cheese   the po boy was slammin  very sloppy and messy but indeed delish  the sauce is tangy  sweet with a hint of kick  heat  to it  the slaw was yummy as well    sigh  i think i will forever be on a quest to find the perfect mac n cheese  aside from my own  of course   they gave me a nice amount and it wasnt terrible  it just wasnt  omg yassss  and ive been searching for that for years  ho hum   still  at  6  im pleased  it hit the spot  it was good and they were quick with my order   like arnold schwarzenegger     ill be bock  
fairly new store that is nicely decorated  which surprised me   i feel like a elegant broad in there    the guy  dont remember his name   that works there is extremely friendly and polite  i believe he is the owner as ive only seen him  and im guessing his wife  working the counter   smoke world has everything you really need for a good time  beer  wine  liquor  smokes  junk food  sugary drinks  scratch offs   you know  the high class life   they also have some  very little  vaping items  e juice which i thought was pretty neat   their scratch off display is quite impressive and enticed me to buy  10 worth  damn these gamblin genes   i dont smoke anymore so im no longer a frequent convenience  liquor store type girl  but whenever im in the area and im thirsty  need booze or some chips  i only go to this store 
wow   the brothers burrito with chicken though   out of this world good   i hate to compare chiptole but its like  you kinda have to  so  sorry chipotle    chipotle has never been a favorite of mine  when everyone was delcaring chipotle the best mexican food theyve ever had  i wanted to sling shot myself into outerspace because who wants to live on a planet where people believe that   i came to ocb not really expecting something to blow me away but oooh it did  im a big cheese fan and i always order extra cheese on everything  yeah  i know its unhealthy  big whoop  wanna fight about it    the cheese in my brothers chicken burrito was so very delicious   i dont know what the difference is  maybe having two cheeses is a factor  but boy is it gooood  the chips were phenom too as well as my gauc  nice and lumpy with no crunchy nasty onions in the mix    i ate half my burrito and took the rest to go  then got home a few hours later and ate the rest  no leftovers for tomorrow  sadly   the place is so very quaint  well decorated with a mexican theme  duh  and the employees were nice  and they were quick which is muy importante     the only thing i was disappointed in was the horchata  it tasted more like hornada  bleh  it was like drinking cinnamon water  no maam  funny thing is  i actually bookmarked and eventually came to ocb for the sole purpose of trying out their horchata  buying a burrito was an afterthought  ha 
as far as mississauga is from mexico  though they both start with a  m    this place is definitely one of the better places for mexican food in the area  dare i say all of toronto   all their tortillas and ingredients are fresh  the guac is great  generous portions  chip and salsa  fried tortillas drizzled with chocolate and cinnamon for dessert  and some authentic mexican flair     this little diner spot definitely beats the mucho burrito and chipotle chains in toronto    i usually get the wet burrito  which is about  11  its heavy  filling and might put you to sleep  but its oh so good     for a slightly healthier alternative  the also have a salad bowl which ive also tried  which comes in a  i think  made on premises crunchy tortillas bowl   its pretty good  but id stick with the burritos  enchildas  tacos  etc  etc   which are all great   being a fan of tex mex  you cant really compare it to places in the us of a which has aweeeeesome tex mex for dirt cheap    but for toronto  this place is just awesome and satisfies the tex mex cravings i get every so often 
when interviewing for a job  they say the interviewer makes a decision in the first 5 seconds  first impressions are likewise important with food  im sorry but pastries and cookies sometimes just look good  and sometimes just dont  the presentation of pastries here was underwhelming  nothing  looked  good  and the decor was subpar  im not a big decor guy  but it does leave an impression      der brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in woodchester mall   a selection of freshly baked breads   3 per loaf  lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries  homemade cookies and desserts   i stopped by for breakfast  but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing  the only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing    1 50  see the picture   but it wasnt very tasty  there wasnt another person in the place  so im questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are    individual apple pies   3 each   homemade cookies   3 per box  looked fairly average   on the positive side of things  when i walked in through the door i was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good  i wouldnt mind trying a sandwich  but the pastries and cookies didnt leave a good impression     not much of a place for decor  had a few tables for sit down as they serve sandwiches and soups during lunch 
rice  lots and lots of rice    i ordered the chicken biryani which came so highly recommended  and boy  do they give you a lot of rice  check out the pics i uploaded  the box is absolutely stuffed with flavorful  aromatic rice  i swear after poking around i thought to myself   um    wheres the chicken  as it takes a good amount of digging before you find the treasure  two chicken drumsticks buried in the mountain of carbs   dont take this as a complaint though  the rice has a good aroma  is flavored nicely with saffron and is generally really good  on the downside  the chicken itself was small  like i mentioned  two small drumsticks  and didnt have much seasoning  but for  5 its a good deal overall    if you want a cheap meal  enjoy indian rice or want to feel like a pirate searching for treasure  check out the chicken biryani  ill probably try other items on the menu though if i go back 
horrible gel mani  pedi  it was not only rushed but it was poorly done and the tips were incredibly crooked  never again will i come here 
strongly recommend  this is truly a local business that loves its local community  ownership is sincere  genuine and passionate  they make so many delicious baked goods  yum 
way over priced for the low quality of the food  nachos are very small and soggy   more iceberg lettuce than anything else  cocktails are way over priced   10 for a caesar that is the same as the most basic one i could muster at home 
cold and refreshing juices  the green glory is spicy yet hydrating  and the sandwiches are perfect for lunch  i had the chicken  kale and loved it  
a good mid range casino choice   the  15 resort fee is ridiculous    the hotel and casino have an older crowd  if thats what youre looking for  its a good way to avoid the more rowdy casinos   the rooms themselves are good enough  not spectacular like the higher end casinos  but not shabby either 
aside from an interesting name  there isnt much else reason to come here  the food is pretty average  it comes out quick and the service is nice  cheap food option outside of the strip 
first time heading here  it was during ces   needless to say we were unable to get the more desirable reservations   friend drove us and accidently made a wrong turn and somehow ended up in ballys parking lot   it seemed like we were driving around in circles   arrived and was asked to wait for our table   approached the bar and ordered a round of drinks   finally was seated and started ordering   i ordered the bone in ribeye and we all shared a few sides   they brought over 2 baskets of warm bread which was devoured in a matter of minutes as we were all starving   waiters brought the steaks and we were asked to cut a slice of your steak just to make sure it was cooked correctly   mine was cooked perfectly and everyone elses was as well   sides were all good and were served by the waiters     didnt have any of their desserts as we all were stuffed   waiter asked that we provide either a business card or our address   whats cool is that they personally write a letter to you thanking you for the patronage   definitely a nice touch   second visit was just recently where i took a few coworkers for a nice dinner   of course it was during the western conference semi finals   we were lucky to get a table facing the bar where we could watch the game   two of us had money on the line so it was perfect   this time around ordered just the normal ribeye   again it was cooked perfectly   we ordered a special side for the night  forget what it was  along with the skillet potatotes   the special side was tasty but the skillet potatoes was a tad on the salty side   again we were all too full for dessert and just asked for the bill   waitress again asked for our contact information and a few weeks later  a nice letter arrived in the mail   definitely a solid steakhouse in the las vegas area which is only a few minutes away from the strip 
was finally able to check off e from my list last weekend   securing reservations wasnt super difficult as we wanted to dine earlly  allowing me more time to gamble after dinner    as others have mentioned  we received our golden tickets a few days prior to our scheduled time     arrived promptly at 5 15 and was escorted to a communal table where a waiter will take your drink orders   we had planned to bring our own wine but the shipment didnt make it in time from napa so we opted to try their sangria   oh they do charge a corkage fee of  50  bottle so dont be shocked to see the corkage on the bill if you do bring a bottle     you are served a total of 20 courses which range anywhere from frozen sangria to wagyu steak   the chef are super interactive and do an excellent job of describing each dish and loved being able to see them plate each before they were served   after browsing some other yelp reviews  it appears that they only change a few dishes based on whats in season     all dishes were super tasty and the only dish i didnt enjoy was the raspberry jelly with goat milk cheese   the meal was pricey but it definitely lived up to the hype and if youre in doubt of whether or not you can justify the price  just think this meal includes the food along with a one of a kind show 
came for the brunch   the unlimited mimosas in a variety of flavored  the strawberry basil is amazing  the brunch is all you can eat in small plates so it gives you a chance to try a little bit of everything  i had some firsts that i had not had before   the oyster taco  peruvian shrimp and grits and the churro tots   i voted for the owners on top chef  mary sue miliken and susan fenigen  loved her so was very excited to come to her restaurant 
mediocre food sexist service  methinks not   i came here to chill on a sunday night by myself and got seated at the inner bar  i asked about the menu on the chalk board because its written in greek  the server didnt offer me the daily fish  seabass  special  he claimed that he never offered it to anybody because of its  38 price  but he offered it to a single middle age man right beside me  sexist much  i guess since im woman  i will never have enough money to buy a  38 fish  he also didnt offer me dessert  i guess since im a woman  i will never eat any sugary treats either  i found out that this place serves dessert later on when a friend pointed it out   the tiganites patates   handcut potatoes kefalotyri garlic sauce is a  8 fries good fries  but definitely not worth the price   not those lemon greek potatoes that people has in mind  the menu is tricky  make sure you have your man to ask the server if youre not sure  i inquire the server about this  but he just said   oh yeah  i know what youre talking about  nah  its just fries   so  it seems that im not the first and only person who got ripped off by their tricky menu  i only ate 3 pieces of fries  there was no regret from the server even though i barely touched the plate  in other restaurants  when a server saw that the plate is barely touched  they would have taken it off the bill  but i guess  since i have no man with me  i dont deserve such treatment   just in case anyone is wondering  i ordered the  8kopanisti   16goat tartare   16halloumi   15roasted cauliflower   8fries   14angostura sour  with tips tax  i ended up spending  100   for this sexist service  this is my second time here  so hopefully this is just a one time thing  i will definitely bring a man next time though 
ive been here twice and didnt dare to post any reviews until ive been here at least twice because sushi places in toronto always disappoints me on my second visit   i had a moment of disbelief that toronto can get this kind of quality of sushi  if you yearn for sushi nakazawa in nyc jiros disciple   this is as close as you can get to that in toronto   its a bit silly to compare this with sushi kaji because the two serves a completely different kind of japanese cuisine  sushi kaji serves kaiseki style meal  yasu  on the other hand  serves just straight up sushi  the chef fold the sushi in front of you and serves it one by one  this is the kind of thing youd expect from real sushi restaurants in japan  not the kaiten sushi conveyor belt sushi  or ayce chinese sushi   service is typical of real japanese restaurants  which are run and owned by japanese  the kind of service where your server offers hot towel before meal with both hand and so on   the fish here depends on whats on season  on my second visit  at the end of the meal  the waitress let us know that they have a special hokkaido uni and shirako from japan  always get their special  the hokkaido uni is a completely different beast from the bc uni that were served earlier  bc uni has this bitter after taste to it  while the hokkaido ones are extremely buttery with a yolk like after taste  definitely worth it 
maybe i am being critical because i was expecting a lot from a place that has the name wolfgang puck attached to it but i was pretty underwhelmed  i had the veal oso bucco special which was tasty but maybe not worth  42 when only accompanied with lackluster escarole  we were there with a big group and the service was attentive and prompt but there was no wow factor in the ambiance or food
this place is so charming and unlike any other  its like being in a romantic candle lit wine cellar with great live music  the staff is wonderful  milynn   taylor especially  so pleasant  helpful and knowledgable  the drink and wine selection is impressive but the food is not to be overlooked  the cheeses  duck tacos and flatbreads are amazing and they serve really late which is awesome  love love coming here  such a refreshing place in the middle of old town
this was our umpteenth visit to the  queen  but brought first timer friends  it is queens table week and therefore the service  while efficient  was hurried  we all felt a bit pushed    being a big fan of the crawfish etouffee my choice was easily made  we each ordered a different entree and seemed pleased with our choices  did i mention the service was swift  we could have finished our meal in an hour flat  our server assumed  correctly  that we were ordering from the special menu and removed the regular menu because  you wont be needing these   if you want return customers you may want to allow sufficient time to peruse the regular menu to see what other choices are available    food was good  as always  but wouldnt recommend visiting during this promo week  my usual rating is 4 s but not this visit   sorry got to run             
the two stars awarded reflects an average score based on our dinner today  this eatery is housed in the  old  tony saccos using the same gas  coal fired baking technology  not much difference between the two establishments   the space is bright and welcoming  as numerous associates welcomed us to kenna coal fired kitchen  our wednesday visit was greeted with an unexpected promotion offering  10 selected large pizzas  it would appear there are specials available most days and would suggest you check whats on sale each day   wait staff is attentive  friendly and helpful explaining a varied menu and the days promotion  we shared a rather generous 1  2 greek salad consisting of fresh  large pieces  of greens  tomatos  olives and italian dressing  feta was served on the side as requested  the half salad is adequate for two   the pizza was  unremarkable  or as my bride said  a waste of calories   the very thin crust pie was painted with tasteless red liquid  fresh mozzarella and plenty of inexpensive pizza meat aka pepperoni  considering the neighborhoods pizza competition  kcfk has some opportunity for improvement despite the high star totals by my fellow reviewers 
do not bother going here    this place does not care for anyones business as they never pick up their phone after calling continuously for an hour during their normal business hours   of course  if you were to walk in  they would tell you to call for an appointment   if they cant be bothered  what can one expect of their actual service 
went to this place as part of my tast of old town scottsdale tour and was immediately charmed by the establishment  loved all the belly pots of olive oils and vinegars  loved kelsey who gave us the samples  loved the atmosphere  love places like this  a bit unique  a bit of an experience   hard to leave this place without buying something so of course we did 
we came here after seeing nutcracker at symphony hall   having a great dinner at squid ink  it was sunday night 5pm and it was packed     the rink as gotten fancier every progressing year  this year it had real railings with clear inserts plus a circular seating area in the middle  and the rink instead of being a simple square its straight with some circular areas  it also has decorative arches now complete with stars    cost is  12 including skate rental and unlimited skating time  which i think is still a great deal    who doesnt love skating outdoors in the beautiful arizona weather with christmas music playing    apparently everyone since like i wrote in the beginning of the review  the place was packed  so packed that my 8 year old after 10 mins or so said he didnt want to skate cause it was hard to move    luckily  the skating rink gave me a free voucher to return  and he gave me a tip  come in the morning  early  for more relaxing  less crowded skating 
met a girlfriend here for lunch  was on a 10 day detox so my choices for food were limited but i was not worried coming to a place like this  i knew regardless of my food restrictions even if i was the worlds pickiest eater  i was in good hands   my girlfriend ordered their ahi tuna salad and i ordered their chopped salad with no dressing  basically a bowl of variety of chopped veggies  raw  nothing else added  the salad came with feta and as i was not doing feta as part of the cleanse  i explained this to the waiter  with a smile  he whisks it away and promptly comes back with a salad with no feta   although my girlfriend doubtfully asked if the salad was tasty with no dressing  no feta  nada nada except for a bowl of delightfully fresh veggies  the salad was indeed extremely flavorful with the mix of beet  corm  and bounty of other goodness     the key is freshness and grassroots had plenty of it  i wish most people would realize that with the right combinations of greens and vegetables  the flavors of just the natural goodness packs plenty of flavor  no dressing needed  no feta or any cheese needed  its a cleansing of the palate and the body   i digress  okay  grassroots was everything i expected  even though it was my first time here  i just knew their menu and service would be excellent and i was not disappointed   
yup  its my 4th time having sushi in 4 days   this time i took my son who is 4 and has already developed a taste for sushi just like his mama   we ordered the tuna  salmon  and yellowtail sashimi  6 pieces    10 each  and an order of chicken teriyaki   12   the sashimi came first and to my surprise  there were 10 12 pieces for each kind of sashimi   we were delighted of course and still fought over the number of delicious slices of fish each one of us ate   then the chicken teriyaki came and to my surprise  it was a lean cut of chicken breast with very little sauce  which was just perfect for my low   no carb diet   with a big bowl of rice which was perfect for my son   my son said   thanks mommy for taking me out to this supper dinner   which sums up our meal   why not 5 stars  there was just one waitress for the whole restaurant and while she was very friendly  service was slow which can be hard for this mama with a hungry 4 year old in tow 
i liked this place  its locally owned and very small  tables are squeezed in  when we were there it was busy and we were not in a hurry  okay    first we waited in line to order then we were told to sit down and someone will take our order  okay    then we were forgotten  oops    i had to go back up to the counter to order  i was told to wait  okay  then she forgot me again  finally she remembered me as i stood at the counter for another 10 mins  about 40 mins later  was not apologetic a bit brisk in fact  okay    then i showed her my check in offer from yelp and her mouth formed into a small  o     after that  not surprisingly  service improved  oops   too late   
each time ive come to this discount tire location  ive always been greeted and serviced promptly  this motto of great service is what makes discount tires so successful  and their unflappable enthusiasm to check your tire pressure for you and patch any leaks free of charge  just amazing    once  for some weird reason  my tires were either low or leaking  it was very close to closing time  i called them and they actually waited for me to show up  took care of my issues before they closed shop   talk about building costumer loyalty  two yelp thumbs up 
this place is super fun especially if you have little kids to make having sushi an experience   my son loves to sit at the countertop area and watch all the different sushi go by then pick what he wants to eat  the good thing too is the fact that the portions are smaller so if youre a kid you can try a varieties of dishes to discover what you like to eat and as the parent  youre not breaking the bank as your kid is embarking on this culinary adventure  my son has a great time here   he will ask to come here and happily for me  each time hell pick up his favorites like salmon sushi and california roll but he will also pick out one or two new dishes to try  its great to come here during happy hour which is when i try to go as both my son and i can get fill up on sushi for around  12 for the two of us  i cant imagine this happening anywhere else  the staff is friendly   always with a smile and prompt with service 
i came here with a group of lady friends   most of us had their lunch special which is for  5 you get a slice of their gourmet pizza and choice of either caesar or mixed salad   the salad comes on its separate plate and the pizza is a big  generous slice    both were very good  i loved the crust of the pizza  nice and chewy  baked in one of those big  wood pizza ovens  excellent on the first day  fresh out of the oven  forget your carb count   just eat it all cause it will not be hard   not tasty at all the next day    why 4 stars and not 5   our waitress seemed a bit surly  it seemed like she was the only one serving in the whole restaurant so she was needed everywhere at once  i didnt mind it too much since i know how that can be from my college days working as a server myself    check in and you get an order of garlic knots which are pipping hot and garlicky delicious    i would come here again  the salad and pizza are good 
came here on a sat  afternoon for a 4 year old birthday party       can you say swanky and cool    the atmosphere there is the bomb  apparently  for one set price per child  they will be unlimited refills of drinks and food for the party  which is perfect if you have teenagers who dont blink twice at having 10 hot dogs    we had a table laddened with hot dogs  fries  pizza  popcorn  potato chips  talk about a kids food heaven    we were situated at the last lane which was perfect  the kids could run around safely while the adults lounged around and have adult conversation   they have a full menu and full bar to satisfy any adults appetite   i took a tour of the place and became very excited by the vibe of the place  sleek  modern  new  clean         that i wanted to bring all of my friends here to have a good time that i texted a group of my friends right then and there about having a night out   the waitresses were great  very friendly and told me that on friday and saturday nights the a dj comes and spins cool tunes  she says the place gets packed so make sure to make reservations for a lane   they have pool tables too    what a great addition to downtown phx       would not be surprised if tarantino shoots a scene at this lounge       this place is that cool 
this year instead of running the half  i rode my bike in their 20 mi bike tour  what a great way to spend the morning   the ride was mostly flat  extremely well organized and enjoyable  in addition to the bike tour  half  and full  theyve added a mini marathon which is 5 4 miles   i was ohhhh  so impressed by their logistics of getting everyone in and out  have to confirm but i would say there were easily 10 000 that day   pretty soon  this event is going to turn into the pf chang rock n roll nation 
the best diner breakfast in the area  basic american with a greek influence and waitresses who call you honey or darlin   i love the greek omelette and have them add spinach  it has been our family go to location for breakfast since we moved here 5 years ago 
the gyro is huge  same with falafel  hummus is creamy and fantastic  but i wish it came with more pita  the food here is incredible  ive never had their traditionally american foods  ive never felt compelled to  considering how good the middle eastern is  but people tell me its good  ive never eaten in the restaurant  always got pick up  and the wait is never too long for that  great little shop 
the bubble teas are small but awesome  im not into raw food so this place isnt my favorite but the pad thai and pineapple rice are very good  spring rolls arent fried so i ordered them but didnt try them  husband loves their sushi 
great hotel  ill def be back to stay here  very friendly employees  amazing breakfast 
absolutely amazing  went in with the worst shoulder pain that i had for about 2 months  angela did a great job it was totally worth the money and mu husband and i will be returning 
organic garage is nothing but the best  fabulous staff  excellent service and a variety of products that will make your head spin and your mouth water  seriously  its my absolute favourite place to shop  to top it off  they also have great prices 
this restaurant has been open for a short time but if the meal we had is any indication  it should be here for a long time  we started with two items from their dim sum menu  the spring roll was a delicate wrap that was nice and crisp   the steamed dumplings also were made with a delicate wrap that wasnt doughy like you often find   we shared an order of orange chicken which had tender white meat chicken   all three items  wwere delicious   the dim sum are served all day  the dim sum menu offers a variety but is not as extensive as you find at some of the restaurants that offer dim sum only at lunch  the staff was friendly and helpful  we will definitely be going back to try some of their other dishes 
i have been going to dr  rios for several years and i think he is great  my eyes are a weird shape and i always had difficulty finding contact lenses  but he was able to determine the perfect brand  i agree with several of the other posters regarding the facility being a bit dated and the office staff not always being the most professional and pleasant  however  i care more about my physician being competent and professional than his staff 
i absolutely adore this diner  i go whenever i have off as often as i can  ive only gotten breakfast but its amazing  their pancakes are the size of their plates  if not bigger  i get the omelets a lot because theyre cooked perfectly to me  ive also had the chocolate pancakes and they offer specials which are no more than  7 for a ton of food  so much food for what you pay  its a great diner for anytime with anyone 
if you are downtown  work in the area  this little mexican joint hits the spot  they are a pretty diverse menu  e g  enchiladas  burritos  tacos  salads  various mole and stew dishes   etc   the burritos and enchiladas come with a choice of sauce  verde mild  chipotle  or mole   if youre looking for something spicy they have a special hot sauce as well  the combos come with sides beans  pretty good flavour   and rice  salad  the flavours are all there and the prices are pretty decent  its a better value to get the lunchtime taco meal but the meal combos  about  13  are delish  ill be honest though  if youre looking for a crazy authentic mexican cuisine  this isnt the place  this place is good  has the right flavours  but definitely dont compare it to your abuelas cooking 
this place is awesome the atmosphere is cozy  their job on the hands and feet is perfect  they take the time to get to know you   when you come in again the next time they will greet you by your name   i highly recommend this place you will feel cared and loved
brand new store everything is so nice and the deli is awesome sandwiches and rice bowls
im sorry i wasnt impressed at all  i ordered four dishes and all four lacked in flavor  ive been wanting to try this place ever since i heard about it  i drove a good distance just to be disappointed   sorry will not be going back 
our party of 4 all loved every part of our meal at hulas   the food was delicious and full of flavor with just enough spice to make it interesting   there was a great atmosphere with fresh air flowing through the restaurant and an upbeat environment   the service was above average   we will return again and again 
i had passed this place many times and was always interested  so we stopped in for dinner one friday night   it was very average   the salad was really small and mostly just wet lettuce  the bread tasted store bought  and the meals lacked great flavor   it was quick  our service was fine  and the price was reasonable   i have no reason to go back  though 
the mandalay bay event center was a lot larger than i expected  in fact  it is reportedly larger than the sands exhibition center  and that is pretty large    neither are as large as the las vegas convention center  where they have shows like the consumer electronics show  comdex or the national association of broadcasters  which bring in over 100 000 visitors     but for the next tier down in show sizes  the mandalay bay can handle it  it is connected to the mandalay bay hotel  if you walk past restaurant row and out toward the shark reef it is just beyond there  since the mandalay bay is also connected to the next door luxor  which also is connected to the excaliber  and on the south side  you have the higher end the hotel and 4 seasons  there is enough accommodations nearby to handle show vendors and attendees    the mandalay bay event center is on 2 floors  so it can be broken up to accommodate smaller shows concurrently  there are large escalators to the top floor as well as elevators  there is a fedex next to the bottom floor  which is great for show shipments in and out  although most shows are professional managed by greyhound exhibition services  or whatever they call themselves now   ges relationship services  maybe  i forget   it has all the amenities of most large venues  however  unlike the sands  which has its own cafeteria and box lunch vendors  the mandalay bay has a mall type food court near the escalators  so you can choose from half a dozen food concessions instead of that pretzel  boxed sandwich and diet coke at the cafeteria like places at the sands    for the evenings after the show  you can always go back and book dinner at one of the half dozen finer restaurants at the mandalay bay  like fleur  red square  shanghai lillys  or aureole  etc    there is a tram that connects the excaliber  luxor and mandalay bay  this is separate from the monorail that goes down to the lvcc through casino row  and is free 
this fedex office is not really an office  it is more like a copy center in a closet    fedex bought out kinkos several years ago  and slowing started changing the name  from kinkos  to fedex kinkos  and for the past year  fedex office    they clip fliers on your shipping receipt that let you know you can have fedex pack your shipment  too  value added services is the name of the game  to increase revenues for these mostly 24 hour convenience business centers    i use fedax a lot  perfer them over ups  because they still have way bills you can fill by hand and charge it to a corporate account  ups stopped that because of too much fraud  will fedex be next   this fedex was hard to find in the big box strip mall it was in  look hard or ask someone where is it  like i did 
professional and friendly  i had an 8am appointment and they completed everything and i was on the road by 8 30  they also have a fantastic warranty program  im hooked  thank you discount tire   
mmmmmmm  tomato basil soup  shrimp and polenta salad  berry salad  salmon salad  angel hair with shrimp  mushroom ravioli  i could go on and on  ive never had a bad meal here  the food is fresh and delicious and reasonably priced  they also do a great job with to go food for small catered business luncheons 
great local pho place and comparable to little saigon  the reason this is our regular spot is because staff is super friendly and consistent  little saigon disappointed us on a few occasions by not giving us extra lime   because they ran out   right   so we dont go back  though their pho is very good  its not like were asking for a whole lime tree  maybe just a couple extra wedges  anyhow  pho tai bac has delicious rolls and to date  its the best ive had  pho is awesome  portions are great and they have super hot pickled chilies  great friendly staff  fast service and fresh food  we love this spot   tip  eat in only  we ordered out once and it was awful 
ill be honest  when we first stumbled into this place i thought it would be bland and boring  i was pleasantly surprised    we ordered fried beef  or something like that  and beef noodle soup  you get mini apps that are flavourful and vary in texture   yum  perfect flavours to get your eat on  once we got out meal there were a variety of things that came along with the fried beef  stir fried veggies  soup  and rice  all equally great  noodles themselves are really delicious  they are freshly made   chewy and satisfying  soup and beef contents were ok  id order something else next time  service was ok  our waitress wasnt very good at explaining any of the dishes to us  over all id go back  affordable   10 15 per person 
this is our go to ramen spot  close to home  small family restaurant  and obviously   great ramen  and thats all   what do i mean  only order the ramen  everything else is just okay  ive ordered takoyaki and gyoza and was not blown away  it passes if you are craving it but you will be fully satisfied with your bowl of ramen  other yelper pics are accurate pictures of what the place and food looks like   my favourite ramen is the tonkatsu and netsu  piping hot and chewy noodles swimming in piping hot soup  service can be a bit slow  it is a family business  but we love it here  its been consistent so far and we go here at least a few times each month  definitely check it out if youre in the area 
not quite a corporate chain but getting close  food was bland with no flavor and unimaginative  there are a plethora of good places to eat in the vicinity so im confused as why there was a wait for a table  the whole front lobby is a mess when theres a wait  people checking in  people cashing out and servers trying to get beer  the staff dressed however they wanted and looked rather sloppy 
been coming to big heng for over 10 years  love it  usually get the orange chicken with fried rice 
yes  yes   yes  super cool vibe  every city need one or two of these  the food was great  cant wait to go back 
i had tacos today  they are very very dry  al pastor has a very strong flavor that is not pleasant  buche was very good thats why i gave them some stars  service is slow 
we worked with them while purchasing our new house and they were one of the companies we could use to do our flooring and cabinets    first important thing  they only take appointments and no walk ins  make sure you called ahead of time and schedule an appointment  they usually reserve a period of two hours for you so you can explore everything and have some assisting you and giving you their full undivided attention   they have a good selection as far as flooring goes and their prices are pretty good  as for the carpet  cabinets and countertops  i wasnt impressed but they do have a decent selection  a little small    if you have a two story house     i strongly recommend you to add their protection padding if you have pets or kids  it will protect all the wood under the carpet and wont let odors impregnate your house  it does work   my only complaint about this company is regarding their costumer service and installation  they wont return calls  no matter how many messages you leave  they wont talk to you about sealing your grout  which a lot of new homeowners know nothing about  and when it was time to install the cabinets they messed up in one of our doors so now we will have to have them come out and fix it  other than that  theyre affordable and ok to work with 
i cant express enough how awesome this place is  great beer  not expensive   friendly staff  and literally all of the classic arcade games from the 80s 90s  if youre looking for a good place to kill some time  this is the spot  on busy nights  you might have to wait in line to play some of the games 
this place has spent more effort on tv screens than its food which was dry and tasteless  total waste of time definitely not coming back 
pretty good  i liked that i could sit with the large window open and enjoy the fresh air   i got a bagel and home fries  they were both good  i am from nj so i am constantly searching for better bagels near pitt  i would say this is probably my favorite spot to get a bagel that is walking distance from school  would recommend if you are looking for a cheap breakfast or brunch 
for me the hotel was at good price point  since the rooms have so much space  obviously it isnt a brand new hotel  but its near mostly to everything and its clean 
there were some really good moments during my lunch experience here   the hostess already put me in a relaxed mood when i called in to make my reso   i asked for a table for two either 12 30 or 1 and she said  lets reserve your table for 12 45 and you can come whenever you choose  which was a good thing because we showed up at 1 15 and of course they didnt make a fuss at all     i started with raw tuna if i remember correctly   dont know what its called but it was served on a thin flake of something crunchy and orange centred radish slices on top   the main was the halibut which came with the most delicately roasted vegetables   i found the halibut itself a bit salty but im not sure if that because im from vancouver and the halibut is different on the west coast   nevertheless this fish was very moist with melt in your mouth qualities   i have to admit i wasnt sure about this texture as some parts were almost crumbly but i gave the chef the benefit of the doubt   and let me say  it was brilliant to offer recommended pairings for only  7 for the demi size   the wine came from some obscure places like serbia but they tasted amazing    the dessert was the only thing i wish could have been more exilirating on the tastebuds but the coffee was cherishable   overall good food and service   my only real criticism is they could try make the experience more exciting  and by that i mean making the food exude more attitude   almost as though you be thinking  damn the chef is bad a s s    the interiors were a bit eccentric   and the soft spokeness or lack there of of the other patrons made me feel like i was in an atom egoyan film   only instead of the leonard cohen soundtrack there was no music today 
this place is as good as it gets for mexican  particularly the happy hour   they have great margaritas  quality food and the flan is excellent 
i inherited an upright player piano from my late great aunt  i had it moved from las vegas to southern utah by the careful movers  erick arrived at my house right on schedule  he was so nice and careful with everything  he was even generous enough to bring other items with him other than the piano  he did all the moving by himself  and he did it flawlessly  i would highly recommend him to anyone who needs pianos moved   it was such a pleasure meeting and talking with him    p s  dont forget to tip  
amazing coffee   great italian style salads and great paninis  i love the way they ask you to get a table and the waiter yells around you name until he finds you  very italian joint   very italian  bada bing bada bing  oops     i didnt wear my addidas fitted track pants with my canada goose  lol
the food and service was outstanding  the soup and lo mien delicious   thai spicy shrimp as well 
their tans are great but the customer service is not  i have been a customer for years but will no longer be going back because of the poor customer service 
i thought this was a beer store   it is   but   its more   its a  beer bar    i guess   okay  so what differentiates this place from any other beer store     selection staff perks  so the selection is ridiculous   if youre a beer lover  youll be the proverbial kid in the candy store here   and that can be overwhelming     except the staff is extremely knowledgeable and apparently spends a good portion of their day drunk  because how else do you know a bit about every beer in a place that has every beer     perks   buy a beer and leave   sure   but why not get a cold beer and watch a movie at the connected row house theater   but jim  you say  my beer is warm   no   no it isnt friend   they have this magical beer cooling device that takes your warm beer and cools it in a couple minutes   how have i never heard of this device     anyway   very cool  fun  trendy place to take a date who likes beer   or a buddy who likes beer   or really anyone who likes beer     this places is not ideal for someone who does not like beer 
best tacos in pittsburgh seems like wan praise   like   prettiest girl in the trailer park   and i dont have a ton of experience with taco places  or trailer park girls   but i have some   and this is the best one     i try to avoid referencing other places relative to a place im rating  but suffice it to say that smoke has competition  but as far as a more or less conventional ingredient taco goes   smoke is it   like coke is it   see what i did there    nice beer selection   very cool decor   great location   friendly servers   great food     win 
this was a nice night out   paint by numbers for grownups   the staff was fun and funny   it was a perfect birthday gift for my mother and i to enjoy together   byob
if there are down sides to the restaurant they are these   no reservations  and no wine menu   the workarounds are relatively simple   put your name on the list  then go next door to grapperia to grab a cocktail or two while you wait  then bring a bottle next door when you return   this worked really well for me  but did have the unforseen side effect of pigeon holing me with a dish that would pair well with the wine id selected  it had a dragon on it that breathed fire  and the fire had  burned away  part of the label   it was a pinot noir  which is a decent wine if you have to pick one  but if were really being honest i picked it because of the label  which kicked ass    next time around   and there will be a next time  the food was really good  ill peruse the menu first  then whilst awaiting my callback   ill pick a wine that pairs with that dish   because of the pinot though  and also because it sounded good  i picked the  pappardelle con coniglio e funghi   braised rabbit with pappardelle pasta  roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms   at  17  i thought the price point was really reasonable  i know pasta isnt generally super expensive  but i still thought it was sane    it was earthy and had a nice balance of pepper to it   paired well with my flaming dragon wine  the name   i dont remember the name  but that dragon is burned indelibly into my mind like the label from the bottle      service was casual and well informed  prompt and courteous     ambience was clean and casual  well lit  cheerfully   tuscan   someone who knows stuff will have to check that   i thought of tuscany     dessert was a very well executed tiramisu     a nice experience overall 
this restaurant is a few blocks from the university of toronto  it looks like your average diner so if fancy ambience is your thing just move on  but if you like cheap good food then this is your place  they have daily combo specials under 10 bucks that will fill you up  i like their kabab combos which will come to you fresh and hot  they are also open late to accomodate the students  i will definitely come back the next time i am in toronto 
i was in desparate of a lash extentension filli think i jus about called every salon in vegas  then i happened to come across sofia at the phenix beauty and salon on buffalo  flamingo  i called her and told her my situation and i neededher services asap  this very sweet woman made me a special appt  for 2 hours later on the very same day her skill is worth a 6 star rating if there was one  she is spot on with her experienced hands and knowledge  if youre thinking about lash extensions  or just needed a fill like me then look no further give sofia a call  i guarantee a you will not be disappointed and will become one of her regular customer like i am  and thank you sofia you did a beautiful job with my lashes much mahalos to you char b 
i just officially had the best sushi in az if not in most of the country  i let the chef select and everything was amazing  soy sauce would be a sin to put on this  tuna  yellowtail and a stripped bass  im still waiting for my  special roll  and i cant wait  dont let the outside fool you  this place is legitimate 
they are so unorganized   ive had multiple lessons scheduled and learned they didnt have us on the schedule   its not fun having to explain to a little girl that they didnt have her on the schedule 
cash only unless above  10  debit only   we used to go here all the time for their steamed pork buns  its adequately stuffed with pork  lots of selection for sweet cake rolls  and bubble tea 
errr very meh  got our order wrong  meat was terrible  actually there was barely any meat in our bland noodles    cool decor tho 
cheap chinese food  staff is your typical no fks given server  exactly what i expected  i like this place because they open so late at night  perfect pick me up for uoft all nighters out there  look for their late night menu  gets filled with people looking for hangover cure at 1am  be careful and stay safe   stick to the staple chinese food  dont get stuff like lemon chicken  youll be thoroughly disappointed  another tip is that they  used to  deliver for orders above  20  if youre scared of college   spadina at night you can order in instead 
nostalgic  dont remember many places with floor seating but this was one of them  if you dont feel adventurous or just hit the gym before going you can just sit on a chair in their other dining area  the floor seating is heated in the winter    you get minimal side dish  kimchi and radish only  though the kimchi was pretty big they had to give us a pair of scissors  i would go for their spicier dishes  army stew  rice cakes  as they were the ones that stood out of the bunch  dont go for chicken cutlet  just go to galleria if you really want some   purple  brown rice option is a dollar extra  so no   i went several times and every time the food and service was good  one of the male server even went above and beyond separating our bills into six different tabs with some complicated math equation halves thirds quarters 
this is just like any other pandora jewelry shop  the only difference is that they offer the lucky dice  it is actually a charm that was originally retired  however now it can only be picked up in vegas    i had to pick up two   one for me and one for my mom   that way we can always remember our time in vegas baby 
i just love small plate restaurants  its just so much fun to go there with some friends  order a couple of different dishes and share  we went there with four people and we each picked out two dishes for dinner and one dish for dessert and it was just enough  so here is a list of what we had   dinner    gentlemens guac   three stars   drunken dunkin dip   four stars   nuttin honey   five stars   surf   turf   three stars   the finger   two stars  only because i personally dont like chicken fingers     jack   coke   three stars   bagel dogs   four stars   slider special   two stars  dessert   grilled pb   j   four stars   cheesecake lollipops   three stars   carmel apple fondue   four stars  other than the food  the staff was friendly  the prices were reasonable  and the decor was fun  oh and the drinks were very yummy   i had the spirit fingers  its sweet  but not too sweet  just enough to make me want another 
beer selection predictable  like pilsner  so ended up drinking stella  i had the burger  not the worst  but not the best   had fried cauliflower  greasy without breading or flavor  s o had chicken sandwich  ok  not good or bad  all in ok wish i had made reservations elsewhere 
i am so glad this mall opened  it truly represents summerlin and has all the stores you need  dont miss pandoras  or sketchers or trader joes    ive been a regular visitor since its opening  passing by today i noticed the ice skating ring is back up for the holidays  i cant skate  but i will take the family and watch  this is a great holiday tradition 
solid food  comparable prices to other nearby eateries  had the lamb and veal doner all dressed with fries   would definitely order again  very filling and perfectly seasoned  all the sauces were delicious  make sure to grab extra napkins  they can be messy   edit  make sure to visit the washroom and press the mysterious button on the wall 
charla is fabulous   i was sooo nervous to do anything when i went in  she was very patient with me  she explained my options and made suggestions  she took the time to show me what was happening during the procedure and make sure i was comfortable with it  she did exactly what i was hoping for  not an easy task since i was unsure myselfshe was knowledgeable and her place is clean  i definitely would  and have  recommend her 
love this chicken   its really hard to find good food in aurora but this place is worth the trip  the chicken is always fried fresh to order so its hot and juicy   not just sitting under a heat lamp all day  its flavorful and super crunchy  the place is clean and the staff are friendly and happy to cater to your chicken needs  if youre tired of the same old dry lukewarm chicken  you gotta try this place out   you wont be disappointed 
so so mex food if not poor   expensive for what you get   2 stars for fair to good cocktails    somewhat pretentious staff   been there twice  dead both nights   wouldnt serve me dinner one night when i stopped in at about 9 30 so i left  they were admittedly dead that night as well  
update your darn hours  they close at 2pm  not 9  was really looking forward to trying this place out 
i have had this on my list for some time  so glad to finally try it  it was really good and you definitely get a great deal here  we ordered a couple of platters including the 100 pieces of sushi  sashimi  and rolls  which was only  58  along with the 80 pieces of assorted rolls  which was only  42   they are always busy and it took about 1 5 hours for our large order  it is more of a take out restaurant than a sit down place  we found the sashimi fresh and it was a nice variety from the usuals like salmon  tuna  octopus along with scallop  squid  and few other fish  the rolls were good  the rice was seasoned nicely and there was not too much rice on the rolls 
we have been going here for over 5 years and have had only great experiences with their rmt services  their staff are professional  experienced  and very friendly  highly recommend 
first time here for dimsum and i liked it  good variety to choose from  and food and service was good  especially good if you come before 11am for their early bird special  looking forward to going to back 
the food is good but its overpriced    11 for pasta barilla and classico    ill pass 
as good as any dunkin donuts  the staff was nice and friendly and my food was cooked well and was good 
best pozole and menudo we ever had  had to order some more menudo to go to take back home 
this hotel is actually quite great  i occasionally fly to toronto for long weekends and love the fact that most the rooms come equipped with a kitchenette  i pop over to the st  lawrence market and stock up on goodies to cook  its far better than spending money in restaurants  although  there are a ton of fabulous restaurants in toronto but you really cant beat the food in the market  in any case  the rooms  yes  theyre clean  have wonderful hardwood floors  pantages has a wonderful spa and everyone is quite helpful  the location is great as its near the mall and other theater venues  on occasion you can get a really great deal but for me it doesnt really matter  this is one gem of a hotel 
jack was extremely helpful and didnt make me feel like i was stupid   most mechanics make women feel real dumb but not jack  he explained everything to me in detail so that i can make an intelligent decision 
their menu changes nightly  comfy atmosphere and fresh italian with nice service 
huge restaurant gaming when you walk in stage with artists playing 7 days a week get the daddy mac shrimp or the coconut asian wings 
a little mishap in the beginning with ordering the hair for extensions but what a turn around with crystal at the front desk    crystal kept me calm and truly elevated my first experience with pico m  she was creative and quick on her feet in fixing my hair order dilemma and now i will be able to make the flight with my new hair      crystal also impressed me with her knowledge of hair care with the extensions which truly amazed me especially for working the front desk thank you crystal and letty for doing all that it takes to please a difficult guest like me    
i like ayce but what happened to those italian dishes  chefs are japanese and they do serve high quality sushi though  smaller amount of rice compared to other ayce sushi joint  which  im sure is a good news to ladies  too bad  only one order of dessert  bc im still dreaming of that green tea pannacotta   update  just came back from nakamuraya    wow  thanks yelpers 
this is my second time here and they left me sitting in this seat for more than 30min    while they are taking care of ladies who came after me  and i do not think theyve made their appointments  i can find this kind of service at the next corner  so after this fill  they will lose me for good 
i wanna give 4 stars to this cozy restaurant  i think people are a little harsh   have you tried their karaage with curry powder or katsudon   im from japan and they taste pretty authentic  i love this place  if you never been to this place  give it a chance  if you havent been here in a while  give this place another chance  when i come here  i rarely order ramen  i recommend other items on the menu  now they serve poke bowl  la style  a lot of things have improved  the servers are friendly and polite  i will definitely repeat 
super cute family owned place with lots of character and nostalgia  best chips and salsa ive had since ive been in phoenix  i just got a couple tacos and they were very good  customer service was great too  i will definitely be going back sometime to take advantage of the  1 75 margaritas all day every day  
i stay at this place probably every other month for business   service is on point and the restaurant is great   however  the room i stayed in last nite was in major need of an overall  very noisy heater  chipped paint and tile in the tub  plus the faucet  on the tub was about to go 
came here the morning after seeing metallica  we got seated quickly and our waitress was quick with the drinks food and check  which was nice because we needed to hit the road back to tucson  glad we found this place definitely will be coming back if were in the area 
rude staff  overpriced  no communication with party hostess   i had a birthday party here today for my sons and i am so disappointed in how we were treated  i had to pull teeth to get my wristbands  we are still waiting for our pop we ordered with hostess no where to be found  and the staff is rude and not helpful   i worked at a similar establishment as a teenager and if we acted the way these  employees  do  we would be without a job in no time   very disappointed and do not recommend this place to my worst enemies   get it together zip city   1 star   edit   they didnt even give us enough time in party room to open presents 
they hit my car with a trash can  i complained and they denied to pay for the damage    what kind of people do this  absolute scum bags   
you can make all of this at home for pennys on the dollar for the price of what you would pay here    dont be a lazy american    also  the music sucks
delicious  enjoy a fresh  exotic and tasty meal in the viennese restaurant  perfect for the hot weather 
so far id have to say the best ive had in 15 years of travel  service above average authenticity seems to be there  excellent spice recommendations   i would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a great gem of a place to eat 
nice local place with healthy food options  i like sitting on back patio which has a zen fountain that creates a nice outdoor ambiance  also a good alternative to the nearby competitor the  egg works  restaurant which can have a solid waiting list  as it did this sunday morning  i like the espresso bar at rachels as well   i have ordered take out online without issues  everything ready and hot at scheduled pickup time 
after all the hype i was looking forward to rock lobster in the way a child looks forward to candy  i was unfortunately disappointed  which seems to happen when a place gets a name like this  with pretty much everything here  our party of three ordered the poutine  the mac n cheese and the lobster roll  we werent disappointed by the amount of lobster which is literally spread on everything  however the fries for the poutine and roll were undercooked  in addition to that  everything was way too salty and   sadly kind if boring  some of our wait staff were ok  however our main server decided to let us know she didnt have change  and complained that she was asked to provide her own float  which she wouldnt be doing apparently    sorry rock lobster   youve let me down 
nice little neighborhood spot for a little family fun  but ive also taken whole teams there to practice  they offer baseball   softball  fastball up to 80mph  people working are always friendly  ice cream is a little pricey but its delicious  very satisfying after spending a hot summer day in the cages 
rhonda rose floral really gets the feel for each of her clients  she personalize each arrangement so the person receiving the bouquet knows the sender heart went into it  it is more of an experience than just picking out a bouquet from a picture online  you can not go wrong with this service  it is a 5 star rating for sure 
who doesnt love a good old fashioned butcher   i heard about john mulls about a year ago from my husbands co worker but never got a chance to go  i finally had to check it out and im so glad i did  we originally went in on july 5th for korean short ribs   i was sad to hear that they had sold out on the friday before due to the 4th of july holiday    duh  of course  theyd be out  everyone bbqs on the 4th  right  well  everyone except me  anyway  he said to come back on wednesday since thats when they would have more  i placed an order for thursday morning   sure enough  when i walked in on thursday  he had a nice brown bag with my name on it containing 5 lbs of korean short ribs  i rushed home to marinate them and was happy to see that they had great marbling   not too much fat  a little thinner than i like but i just know to ask for thicker slices next time   i cant wait to try their other cuts   ive got my eye on the 5 lbs of chicken wings 
my husband has been telling me about farmer boys for about a year  he tells me that theyre out in cali  ive never heard of them  anyway  he decided to take me there because their burgers are supposed to be good or something  i think not  maybe i was just really hungry and cranky  oh wait  wouldnt that make the food taste better     you order at the counter and they give you a number to post at your table  when its ready  they bring it out to you  i asked him to order a cheeseburger and fries for me  i figured id get something simple since these burgers are supposed to be good  as were waiting i notice the jets that are painted on the ceiling  i guess it was a tribute to the af base  in any case  it was a little out of place considering that the wall and decor were country themed    well  my burger comes out and under the bun is a whole mess of what looks like thousand island dressing  it wasnt a light smear   it was a glob of it  yuck  i managed to scrape it up and covered it with some ketchup and tabasco to mask any remains of the offending sauce  the burger itself didnt seem too bad but i think i was just turned off by the sauce  i have to say though  it wasnt the best burger ive had   its not even a mid range burger for me  would i do it again  probably not 
this bru was my go to store before the one on north 5th opened up   i still frequent this one pretty often though   the staff here are very helpful and informative   many of them are a wealth of information in regards to the products they carry   there is one associate at the registry desk that is very informed on breastfeeding and various resources within the valley that you can inquire upon  although it is an older store  i feel that they keep it pretty clean and well organized   they also keep it well stocked as i can usually find what im looking for 
the food was so oily  taste strong  maybe lots of smg  service was poor  and i will not come again 
the food   service was very good the pizza was just a little thicker then ny pizza  i would recommend eating here 
the food is great  but every time i come i seriously wait at least 15 min for my food  thats way too long  i dont know why it takes so much time to throw some beans and cheese into a tortilla  fold it up  and throw it in a bag 
i stopped in the nuggett for a poker tourney last time i was in town and was impressed by the decor   upscale for downtown  i stayed here for christmas weekend and thought they did a nice job  the heated pool is comfortable with the slide that goes throught the shark tank  pretty fun  the room was in the carson tower which is the older of the two but the room was clean and comfortable  service was fast and friendly with john  the manager of the poker room  doing an exceptional job at making people feel welcome and keeping the action going  this place feels like a strip hotel but with the options of downtown like not having to walk 2 miles to the next casino  the buffett was probably the best downtown   granted this is sort of like being the best water polo team in alaska   but its a buffett    overall  a fine job by the staff   ill be back 
ive been to the frog twice   both times i had knowledgable staff that knew a lot about beer    that gives it a thumbs up for me  like other reviews they were out of many of the beers they listed in the book  but had other great beers that werent in the book  perhaps an updated list by week would be the answer    if you are a beer geek  this place isnt far off the strip and has the best selection of beers in the city  well done 
i had been wanting to try this steak house since it opened and i travel to vegas frequently to play poker  every trip out of town and special events in town  i always love a good steak   i hoped for a 5 star time   but settled for 3  the ambiance in the bar area aims for an old school vegas   speakeasy vibe to it   and it hits the mark   i could picture this place as being back in the day   although the lights would be a bit bright for mr sinatras taste i would guess     i sat at the bar and interaction with the bartender was minimal   did his job nothing bad or great to set him apart  i ordered the steak au poivre   the ny strip was cooked to order   and quality wise   ok   average for the price  what did stand out was the au poivre sauce was almost more bbq than peppery  maybe the chef didnt stir it and the pepper settled to the bottom before he ladelled it   i dont know  it didnt ruin the meal  but it was not what it could have been  the potato croquettes  on the other hand  were perfectly done  i recommend that as your side for any meal in the place  what finished off the experience for me was the floor manager  she came by and asked how the meal was  i commented on the positives and then told her about the au poivre sauce   to which her reply was   oh  are you a food critic   perhaps her aim was not to be condescending   i would hope thats the case   but my immeadiate thought was  isnt every customer of yours evaluating their meal     and as someone who has run front of the house in restaurants for 20 years   that was the wrong way to interact with a guest  so   overall   an ok steak house   but i left with a bad taste in my mouth   whether it was the sauce or the manager  im not quite sure 
yummy gelato and several flavors to choose from  but pricey for the serving size  went here using a groupon  otherwise too expensive for this pocketbook 
have been there at the sunday brunch last year  ended up in hospital in page with food poison  i barely survived  because we were in the middle of nowhere  when that started  the doctor said the food poison was from pork   the only pork i had  the only meat at all in days  was the cured ham at the mirage buffet  so in the end the buffet has cost a few thousand dollars and it took weeks to recover  thank you mirage 
this really is a beautiful restaurant  i visited a few months ago  so in this review i will only highlight the things that i still recall  the dining room is elegant and bustling with customers and staff  they offer a tapas menu and a larger plates menu  for tapas  the blood sausage and the sweet potato hummus were the top contenders  all the tapas seem to be served on crostinis  so do not let that catch you by surprise  for dinner  the seared rainbow trout was the chosen favorite at the table  the albondigas fell short on flavor and texture  the basque cake was recommended by our server and this is now one of my top favorite desserts  i plan on visiting the cafe soon  ive heard great things about the pastries and im hoping to try those xoxos 
natt spil is on the top of my list for go to bars  this place can easily be missed since it does not have a sign outside  but once you discover it youll be glad you did  i like many of their menu items  but my favorites are the spicy cheese won tons  chips and salsa  the shu mai  and the pepperoni mushroom pizza  i love the brick oven they have because it gives this place such a cozy feeling  make sure to take a shot of their house infused coffee vodka  goes down smooth and itll give you that needed dose of energy  service here makes you feel like you are part of a family  servers and bartenders are so welcoming and they always go above and beyond when it comes to making the customer happy  shout out to nate  travis  and kym  great crew  a very important thing to know is that this is a cash only bar  come prepared  if not  there is an atm  make sure to check out their awesome mural that they have by the back of the bar 
the donuts are nothing special  and the coffee was very bland  but they provided great customer service 
if downtown i suggest getting away from the hotel restaurant thing and trying eat  its a 5 minute walk from the fremont area  fresh food  well prepared in a nice  friendly environment  we ended up going for lunch one day  thanks to yelp  and returned for breakfast on another 
the food is good  and middle eastern food has always been one of my favorites  i just for a fact cannot shake the feeling that i have been lied to and cheated  the sign outside says gyros are 2   i came around 4 so i understand if the specials are over  but the menu advertises sandwiches to be around 4 5 dollars  there was even a special asu deal that was not written out but supposedly gave me a free drink and side  after i purchased a 5 99 sandwich  i supposedly received a free side and drink  ringing up after i paid about 10 dollars    with tax  it becomes 6 55  i tipped 1 50  so should have came to be about 8 dollars  i dont mind paying extra  or just having tipped more  but deliberately changing the pricing on the spot is a bit low by my standards  this may have been a miscommunication  perhaps free didnt necessarily mean free  or i heard wrong 
im impressed with the quality of meat here  they have beef tenderloin as an option  we had the filtel mignon with onions entre as well as the pho filet mignon  both were excellent  good service  and fair prices  very good food
our air conditioning went out on saturday late afternoon   i called and left a message and mike called back within 10 minutes   he talked me thru several things to try and get it back on but nothing worked so he called eric for a emergency trip out   eric arrived within 30 minutes and was able to get it back on in a short amount of time  as always everyone at ahr was very professional and helpful  thank you ahr
great customer service  my hair dresser was amazing  she did exactly what i asked for   definitely going back 
this location is filthy  the sneeze guard had spit and whatever on it right at eye level   yuck  the employees are rude and pushy  it wasnt even busy  the whole restaurant was dirty and when i went to get a soda  the machine had fruit flies flying around the ice tray  the health department should definitely give this place a visit 
i get my oil changed here when needed because i want qualified vw mechanics doing the job  each time i am told that a battery is dying or an air filter needs to be changed when it was just changed a week ago already   beware   i know they need to make   after they screwed up with the emissions scandal  but seriously i have been to the dealership on azure and they are much more professional   avoid this service department at all costs or it will cost you 
this place is extremely good  try the fake   bake  spicy  and the bubba gump  definitely one of the best sushi places in phoenix  we were very happy with everything and the owners were friendly 
hands down best thai in the city  they also know how to spice it up authentically  ive had a variety of options off the menu and have always been impressed  also  this place is a sneaky great pick to go to pre pirates or steelers as it is conveniently located a few blocks from the north shore 
fucking awesome wings   thy sell anchor steam beer so that makes me super happy     great bar     great beer    great food    
my at the time fiance and i got married at the jp down the street before our wedding in ireland and we came her after our quickie ceremony  it was a beautiful morning brunch with my husband   
fantastic  the atmosphere and the food are wonderful  when i say the service was slow i dont mean it in a bad way  it gives you time to have a drink and appetizer while looking over the menu  what i mean is i didnt feel rushed   the burger i had was the apple   goat cheese  i just moved to the north side and i will visit this place again and again  
went here at 5 30 recently at the suggestion of a downtown hipster friend  place was small and packed  but had great selection of wines and beers that made the people i was with happy  personally im a cocktail guy  so the beer and wine only deal is always a letdown for me  service was passable  the place was small but well finished and is a small house divided into a couple of rooms  this is a place trhat you should be prepared to stand at the enitire time  girls with us in heels felt free to bith about that  the front room seats 4 on opposite sides on the room  the ante room seated about three and the back room had a table for eight  i think  thats it  unless you are lucky enough to grab one of the six or eight precious stools at the bar  interesting mix of professionals and record store employees  pierced and tattaed and etc  and some reasonable eye candy from both camps  who were probably 4 hours early to see some shoe gazers play an off tune set at modified  the place has no sign or address number  unless you count the one molded into the planter in the front yard that is invisible from the street  so look carefully while circling the block youll see it the fourth time around or so  nice little patio out front but you cant eat  drink  or smoke there or at the one out back   wtf  i see this as a low profile pick up joint at the right time of day where guys in suits will quietly eye over the hill punk rock girls  which i like 
first trip  ordered take out consisting of the manchurian gobi  deep fried cauliflower with an asian sauce that came with delicious vegetable fried rice   chicken tikka masala  the bread  naan assortment and a couple of orders of raita  indian yogurt salad sauce   food was delicious  hot  fresh  carefully packed and generously portioned  ill be back  bill was  40  fed 3 
i had the period arepa and my friend had the mechada arepa   we also had two empanadas  the food here is excellent  the staff here was friendly  i will tell all my friends to eat here 
i placed a pick up order online two hours before my pick up time of 12 30  the food didnt even come out for another 25 minutes  they served people that walked in after i did  that placed the order in person  whats the point of ordering online for a specific time and then having to wait another 25 minutes  horrible service and will not be returning 
we almost left right after ordering because it seemed like it was an extreme inconvenience to the clerk  who had to stop talking to friends that were hanging out at the counter when we arrived  im glad we could see the drinks being prepared because i was concerned we might have ended up with a little something extra for the trouble  all we did was order  fortunately the smoothies were great  as they usually are    and therefore the three star rating  if the same person is serving the next time we come back  we will go somewhere else 
found this place while browsing in las vegas      the food is awesome and very authentic   a must try if youre by the flamingo and caesar palace  the only reason i have 4 instead of 5 stars is that they dont have just beef by itself but beef with lamb 
ok so i have struggled with back pain for about 10 years now  i have tried everything and i must say  it has been about a month and my back pain has reduced about 95 percent since my cupping  massage treatment  for the first time in years  i can workout without my pain setting me back  i can sit and watch movies without the nagging of my sciatica  a must try if you struggle with chronic pain  very nice customer service 
just like the reviews before mine i was there june 25 and needed a cigarette lighter charger for car  it was overpriced but i didnt want to leave the strip in search of one  i was sold the charger  an iphone 5 cable  and a solar charger for  100 it turned out to be all junk and a scam in the end  my solar charger didnt work initially and exchanged for another one that didnt work when i got home and the iphone 5 cable now doesnt work either  this place is a rip off and theyre scammers  theyre located in the miracle mile shops in planet hollywood  stay away from this place   
went here for the first time yesterday  4  25  14 with the boyfriend for lunch   i was given a gift card by a friend who camped out  and i have been wanting to go here ever since    we went about 2 in the afternoon  which was a good time for first timers since we could take our time and figure out what we wanted   being used to and loving chipotle  the system is similar therefore familiar  which helps   i got a small pasta bowl with the  hot  alfredo sauce   it was accidentally knocked over  quickly restarted and with much heartfelt apology    i had cheese  and lots of it       with artichokes   the boyfriend had a chef style  meaning it was prepared the way it is on the menu  of calamari much to my grossness    i am not eating anything that can taste me back  is looking at me  or that could suction itself to me   no thank you   uggh     we got italian sodas and  the price is what we would have spent at chipotle  so it is very affordable   the sauce was not as temperature hot as i would have liked  so the dish was cold in spots  but hey  its pasta s so it can be eaten cold  which i do frequently  so i was not upset   the best part was the garlic piada that comes with the pasta or the salad   it reminded me of naan  which i love and i love garlic naan  so already liking it   its full of cheese     i am an unabashed cheese freak  you can never have too much cheese or chocolate    the artichokes were cleaned  grilled with nice crispy char  and  cue the fan fare  acidulated   you need to put fresh ones in water with lemon juice or they turn brown  like avocados for guac     i have been to nice italian restaurants and have not seen this level of care and proper prep     the boyfriend said that the calamari was tender and delicious    ill take his word for it    the divalo sauce had bite he said  but would not clean your sinuses     i so cannot wait until i can go back   so good 
i have been going here for years   the prices have gone up a bit over the years  but the quality and quantity have not changed   i love the turkey reuben   which like all their sandwiches  violates the  never eat anything bigger than your head  rule   breakfast is good too   you need to get there  in the late afternoon or early evening    after 5 is insane   you will have to wait  but it is worth it   excellent mac and cheese  fridays in lent  and it sells out quickly 
i bought two ridiculous priced drinks  one of the bartenders did have some talent with the flipping and pouring  drinks were good just cant get over the price  i gave a  10 tip then they decided to give me the buy one get one free card  lol should have gave that to me first 
went for a meal and to watch a hockey game  had the bangers and mash   the side of beans tasted like they came from a can and the kale was very literally three pieces of plain kale  the sausages and mash potatoes were good    a staff did change the tv away from a tied hockey game with 5 min remaining in the third    overall  a poor experience which was only saved by a good beer recommendation 
i was not impressed with this location at all  i usually will try   avoid doing any shopping here unless its out of sheer desperation  last night was one of those nights  can i say mess  mess  mess  did i mention this place was a mess lol  it starts from the parking lot all the way in   around the store  this store needs a major renovation  unorganized  floors dirty  carts filthy  shelves dusty  items all over the floor  it goes on   on  im kind of surprised that this location has not had its up to date renovation like most of the target stores  especially because its in a prime location in henderson  sunset  stephanie   there is no starbucks either just a filthy lil snack bar  so if your thirsty walking in you better go grab a drink   mcds before  you will see every walk of life gallivanting throughout the store  residence  tourist  pan handlers  kids running around screaming ughhhhhh    what gets me there is a sign posted at the front door that says  no solicitors allowed on premises   well i find this to be amusing especially when ive done other shopping in this center   have seen people with tables   chairs set up right under the sign   theyre selling water  cookies  bracelets  etc    district manager needs to step in   do some major p  r work asap  put a fire under managements a   before it gets worse 
ive been to better locations but the staff was nice  this location seemed stocked but a bit unorganized  this isnt my normal location so maybe i wasnt patient enough to figure out where everything was  store seemed crammed idk  they had alot of good sales  i used my  10 free rewards bucks  i was able to get 4 items  so prices are reasonable  id go back when im in area  theyre located in a good strip mall with a variety of other stores  so this is a plus if you want to get everything done at once 
i love this place  my fav nail tech  waxer is kelly she is amazing  so friendly and pays attention to detail while completing services  i specifically come to her for wax as she does a thorough job  plucks out excess hairs and uses hot towel to clean the area   etc  ive been to so many nail places and noone is better  i travel here from mississauga that is how much i love their services 
ive been here a handful of times  no complaints really  i mean obvi its a bit pricey but its quality produce you are getting  the produce is always a1  they mark down items often   usually when nearing expiry or close to end of life for fruits  veggies  the positive there is the marked down items arent like your chain grocer where its all beat up with no use besides a blender  items are still eatable and good for a few more days  the customer service i found to be great  mostly teenagers work here as cashiers  maintenance  etc  they are always super friendly which is great  the only thing is some arent well rounded on the products sold there   even basic fruits  vegetables  a customer asked one of the girls about a papaya and she had no idea what it was i sort of felt bad for her 
so i went to the movies last night and decided to drive to this theater instead of queensway vip where we normally go  mistake for sure it was a saturday evening movie started at 8 theater 21  yes they have 25 theaters here thats how big the place is   so we bought our tickets first stop is the bathroom  the bathrooms are really nice as the theater is fairly new  although the bathrooms are nice they are extremely dirty   toilet paper everywhere  left over human waste in the toilets  water all over the counters  etc  my bf came out and mentioned how gross the mens bathrooms were as well  after that we went to the concessions to buy food  popcorn is pre made in large batches which is weird cause on a busy saturday night youd think they would make fresh popcorn constantly  nope chewy old popcorn is what we received  but the cashier was a nice teenager didnt seem happy but she wasnt rude or anything  this location also has the coca cola machines where you pour your own drinks w hundreds of options  the table for you to put your stuff on while you pour your drink was all wet w pop and straw wrappers  napkins and stuff  the pop spilled on the counter was all wet and sticky some was stained w means they obviously dont clean it too often  i mean there was even fruit flies   such a turn off  finally we find our theater and the previews are nearly the end but the place is full of kids or teens whatever they are still talking and using their phones  even during the movie this continued   they had their feet on the seats in front of them passing food back and forth jumping up n down on the chairs and being overly obnoxious laughing and making so much noise  i was so not impressed  i mean there had to be like 20 of them in each group  i mean i know its not the fault of the cineplex but from what other people said this is a regular thing  so ye i wont be returning again  its located in a huge entertainments plaza w restaurants  dave   busters  mini putt and more  lots of parking but also extremely busy so you will have to drive around a bit if you arent early 
a visit with kimbra is one of my few selfish luxuries   i always leave feeling better than i did upon arrival   the spa is comfortable and clean and ive never had a complaint in almost two years as a loyal client   if you need to treat yourself  an hour at the skin suite is always well spent 
hawaiian style beef stew just like back home   i shall return for the filipino supermans pastele stew and gandule rice  keep serving up broke da mouth onolicious local grinds my bruddah
nice staff but they dont have tea    first coffee shop ive been to that does not also have tea  cute place  if they had tea i would try them again  but no   
just moved here from los angeles and am missing in   out  this place will fill the void  mostly   its actually much more like the habit  another socal yummy chain   nice fresh burgers  good fries  i like the industrial vibe  too  will definitely be back 
wow  some harsh reviews on blossom  not deserved at all  okay  it isnt the hollywood bowl  another place i have had the pleasure of going many times  since i now live in la  but still  ive seen some great concerts here  pretenders  elton john  back when he still rocked   lollapalooza  ringo starr and yes  the requisite msb concerts  including one of the four sold out nights back in the early 80s  not to mention the excellent cleveland orchestra  blossom is a great place to take in a concert  to either lounge on the lawn or dance on your blanket  yes  the parking situation is horrible  i remember just turfing across some field as i tried to escape that whole mess after a concert  and god help you if it rains  but still  a beautiful place to party 
two stars for the friendliness but since i didnt actually order anything     ummm   i wanted a chai latte  he asked if i wanted a sweetener  so i asked for sugar free vanilla  they dont have that  i asked for splenda or something similar  no  they only have honey  agave  weird  and sugar  i am diabetic  so no  i need sugar free  so i asked for non fat milk  they dont have that but they have almond milk  wtf is that  when did almond trees grow udders   yeah i know what it is  just making a joke   ok this is obviously a place for hipsters because what they serve is just weird  i like giving my business to local coffee houses but this was not my place 
i saw this company at the home and garden show 3 years ago and loved their products   we began our reno this summer and used their beautiful windows in our design plan   we bought a 5x6 leaded glass window featuring 2 peacocks face to face   they are magnificent   we like them so much that we ordered a second window   it was installed yesterday and it is fabulous too   their products are amazing  we are pleased with the results 
back again  this time i tried the mexican pizza and it was delicious  the chicken fajitas are some of the best around  my date ordered the grilled carne asada which is his usual  i love the salsa and they have an extra spicy one if you ask for it  the staff is always attentive and the food is spot on  blue agave is consistent and clean  i like the prices and theres always a coupon available on yelp or the entertainment guide  if you are craving modern mexican for a reasonable price in scottsdale  check them out  i will definitely be back 
first time here  i am impressed   i was in a hurry and had maybe 10 minutes to eat  i ordered in a hurry and chose the italian beef and it was amazing  best sandwich i have had in years  thank you for impressing me  i am a little bummed there isnt at least a little table out front of this location to sit for 5 minutes   i ate in my car which wasnt horrible but i didnt open the au jus container fearing it would spill  i couldnt eat it at my next appointment unfortunately lol  i will definitely be back  the menu is very interesting  i usually get pizza from another restaurant consistently but i may try rosatis since the offer a thin crust  great prices and big tasty sandwiches so give it a shot 
first time at this particular location  no complaints   we bought a pound of fajita meat to cook at home  it was delicious  great prices and clean store  i will definitely be back 
this was our first visit to this buffet  it was ws or b since i wanted to try a new buffet on this trip  as soon as we arrived in vegas this was our first stop  even before checking into our tower suite at the wynn  we walked right up hungry and excited  we paid and were seated immediately at a 2 person table directly in front of the buffet  in my periph i could see the bone marrow which was going to be my first stop  i have never had bone marrow but i was anxious to try it after reading the reviews here on yelp  it was served with a kimchi sauce drizzled on it and it was delicious  we also tried the prime rib which was excellent  the sushi was fantastic as well  loved the duck confit lentil and angry mac n cheese  i thought the service was excellent and the waiters were very attentive    overall we were impressed and we will definitely be back 
although the ambience is good but the food was very disappointing  horrible food  disgustingly dirty plates and cutlery  would never recommend it  paid  27 per person for s  t 
i am so disappointed in the service i received at this restaurant   i went to celebrate my daughters birthday  i was told over the phone that i couldnt make a reservation so i showed up at 5 45 to put my name down but was told they wouldnt take my name until my entire party was there  by 6 05 my party had arrived so i let the host know  we had two people added to the party so i let the host  know  at 6 45  after watching other families who came in later them us get seated  i asked the host what was taking so long  she said because of the size of the our party  we needed two tables  i watched two table become empty and cleaned and two other families be seated  several minutes later i asked why i wasnt given the option of having those two tables since i had obviously been waiting the longest  the host told me that the manager said since we added two more people then originally expected we had to sit at the back table  the people at the back table hadnt even started eating yet  we had already waited more then an hour and would likely have to wait at least another 30 minutes  i asked to talk to the manager  she refused her name  she was very  unapologetic and just kinda shrugged her shoulders as to say  nothing i can do about it  well    myself and my party of 16 decided to walk out and eat somewhere else  by this time it was 7 40  i was so turned off by the lack of customer service here  i will never return to this location  i will also tell everyone i know about this experience 
service was terrible   asked me for my order 3 times then brought out pizza instead of calzone   worst garlic knots ever but the calzone was really really good 
oh wow  i wish i could have eaten everything in there   the cakes were beautiful  but i just needed some sugar so i tried the cream horn  to die for  decorated cookie  very good  and an almond horn  amazing    i dont live in charlotte but if i did id be there a lot  and id have to get a cake    p s  the picture of the cake here doesnt do their cakes justice  
the food here is great  but not worth the disrespect you receive from their employees  ive been here three times now  each time greeted by a different cashier  its always the same spiel   what do you want   thats literally the first thing that comes out of their mouth when i walk up to the register  yikes  also  the first two times i went  i ordered a large iced coffee and received what looked to me like a large iced coffee  when i went back a week ago  i ordered the same thing and it came out in what seemed to clearly be a small cup so i asked about it and the cashier told me that was a large  lady  it was like 5 ounces of coffee  i may look young  but im not stupid  never again 
the only thing going for this chipotle is that you get chipotle quality of food it tastes pretty good    i was there for lunch on 5  21  2014  and waited an absurd amount of time to order and receive my food  i got the impression this chipotle immediately places all online or phone in ahead orders above the orders of customers in the store  i waited about 30 minutes to place my order  and i got there at 11 40  when it shouldnt take longer than 5 minutes   i would not recommend coming to this chipotle to any one  because its quite likely  you will have to wait a long time to place your order and receive your food  and thats not why you dont go to this chipotle  the line is completely unreasonable for any type of food trying to call itself fast   their should be a cut off on how recently they can receive online or phoned in orders  and heaven forbid the staff try to prepare some of these items ahead of time   the only reason this chipotle doesnt get one star is because the food tastes good  but im still bitter about the whole experience 
let me sum it up  food is horrible  mac and cheese was runny  poor service   got a medium mac and cheese i opened it it was basically a small 
we were looking for well made furniture in near perfect condition for a rental home   after shopping quite a few furniture stores we were referred to lynnes by another consignment shop who did not have what we were looking for   we found exactly what we were looking for   marty  who went out of her way to help us furnish the entire house   martys interior design background was a big plus for us as we searched for  accessories to complement our purchase   we were introduced to tom  the owner   who offered his expertise   everyone at lynnes were very upbeat and professional including the gal at the front desk and the warehouse guys who packed the  furniture in our trailer   it took 3 trips to get everything home   we enjoyed our shopping experience and will definitely return 
update  if i could change this to 3 5 stars  i would  went back and had the cheese curds again and enjoyed it  i also had their walleye sandwich and was happy with it  a tastier dining experience compared to my first visit  their onion string fries are quite good too 
kohls has the best looking  brightest  most spacious  and cleanest        bathrooms out of all department stores out there   the whole store is the same way  i love kohls for great deals on clothes and accessories  with kohls cash in hand and coupons  my budget can be stretched further here  i love the little surprise finds too in the watch   jewelry section  as well as from the kitchen   appliance sections 
updated review    another visit to big bs and another amazing dinner   place just keeps getting better and thats hard to do with how perfect the bbq is and dont forget some of the best sides youll ever have in your life       previous review    this place is sooooo amazing  absolutely the best bbq in the valley vegas or henderson   cant be beat   the food is excellent  the staff is friendly  everything is just top notch    i have started eating here at least once a week and i love it 
yes  it has the required  funky atmosphere  for the up and coming leslieville area    though unfortunately the owner refused to turn the music down  just a little  and it was only 7pm   we explained that the four of us wanted to converse without screaming across the table while we had dinner  we hadnt seen each other in quite a while   she said that her patrons  have come to expect the volume at this level  and she wasnt going to change it  we explained to the short sighted owner that it was only 7pm and we certainly didnt expect the volume to be lowered indefinitely or dramatically   she refused   the sad part is  she doesnt seem to realize that the  funky  cool clientele  that shes seeking usually have things to say to one another and like talking   making them scream over one another while constantly having to ask one another to repeat themselves is a huge drag   sure  turn the music up   no problem  but make it after 8 or 9pm once people have eaten  relaxed into the place and are ready to have some more drinks   weve already caught up for the most part so having to yell to talk a little bit later on  isnt so bad   note to owner  if you really want interesting  cool people in your place who have the money to spend on your over priced pretentious food  then humour them a little and let them talk to one another while they eat   you can turn up the music a little later once theyre drunk enough to appreciate the  8 bowl of peanuts you throw on the table   
mike has always come through for me   day  night  summer  winter  the guy is always working   his quality is great and his prices are fair   ive worked with dozens of hvac contractors in vegas  mikes number is the only one still saved in my phone   youll always get an honest  knowledgeable service and work from infinity 
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service  i had a bus to catch so i couldnt wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay  she never brought my check  never checked to see if my drink needed refilled  she just mopped the floors    the burger was really greasy  the fries were luke warm and the cheese on them wasnt as flavorful as it should be  as a new pittsburgher im not impressed 
my husband and i tried this place for lunch a few days ago    the place was packed but we were seated very quickly   service was fast   friendly   we both tried different burgers and they were delicious    and huge    be sure and take your appetite   i had the crispy onion strings with mine   wonderful   lightly breaded  my husband had the shepards pie for his side as we went around st  patricks day   we wanted to try one of the  adult  shakes that had some liqour in it but we were both too full to try   definitely something we save room for on our next visit   great place and plan on returning 
if i could add an additional star i would  matthew is very professional and committed to excellence  work ethic today seems poor but matthew is an honest  hard working and dependable  down to earth individual  he truly takes pride in his work and will go the extra mile  other companies wanted about double the fee compared to what he charged and definitely would not have gotten the same experience  it takes a lot to impress me and he did just that  will continue to use him in the furure and refer wherever possible 
looks like some people had decent experiences with this place which is why i gave it a try  after my experience  i will never bring anything to this shop again  i visited this store once with 2 pair of shoes and 1 pair of boots  i returned on the day he said they would be ready  but they were not  when he went in the back to find my shoes  they were buried in a large box filled with dozens of shoes  the two pair of shoes i gave him were  400 each  one about two years old and one brand new pair  from being thrown in this large box  the shoes were scratched and one of the heels had a large scratch on them  i was in disbelief  especially when looking at the scratches on my new shoes  i couldnt believe the disregard he had for my very expensive shoes  i would think someone who owns a store and has a customer who brings in 3 pairs of shoes costing well over  1 100 that thy would a take better care of their shoes and b realize this person spends a lot of money on shoes and may have more that need work  which i do  that said  my shoes will never be back at this shop 
every time i come in she is absolutely amazing  so kind and genuinely cares about talking with you  my brows always look fantastic once i leave here  the experience and professionalism at eyebrow envy is unmatched by any other salon here in las vegas  and i have been to a lot of them  love love love coming here and will continue to come in and refer eyebrow envy to friends and family  
love love loveeeeee    this place is fantastic  as close to a true ny pizza you will find in vegas    or at least that we have found so far  quite frankly  for us  there is no reason to keep looking once you take your first bite into one of their slices  we have only tried the pizza so far but boy does the rest of the menu look good too  i cannot wait to try out the stuffed shells  it is so hard to ever drive by here without stopping in  it is worth the 30 45minute  depending on traffic  drive for us 
food was really good and fresh with huge portions  cant go wrong with the free baklava on check in  tried the veggie combo and the 1  2 chicken  both were excellent 
visited this place with my husband and a friend on a saturday night  it was packed but we were first on the waiting list and were seated pretty quickly  we were super hungry so ordered drinks and food  was told it would be a  20 minute wait for the food to come  well it ended up being well over an hour before our food was ready and served  we were repeatedly assured it would come out soon and were almost ready to walk out  there was a taco place nearby  when our food finally arrived   so why the 5 star review  our server was really apologetic about the wait and assured us this was not normal for the restaurant  on top of that he comped our first round of drinks  he really didnt have to do that for something that was not under his control   coming to the food   it was really good  worth a 1 hour wait good    probably not  but by then we were so hungry everything tasted awesome  my vegan cassoulet  yay they have vegan options   had a lot of vegetables and was great  my husbands meat pie smelled so good that i ate most of the crust  it was buttery and crispy and just perfect   in the end we walked out smiling and satisfied all thanks to our server so i thought this place deserved a 5 star review 
i am so happy i chose to take my new cat to west towne veterinary clinic  everyone was so nice and helpful  dr  britta oakes was wonderful  and i felt like my nervous cat couldnt have been in better hands 
not a good experience  i drove thru and got my new maple brown sugar bacon croissant  i left and was almost home and opened the sandwich  seethat it was burnt   no big deal   i go back   wait in the long drive through line   and the person at the front never apologized     the customer service was horrible   its just the way we make them   theres nothing we can do about it  i asked for the manager  i have been in customer service forever  the manager was worse  i kindly said they could use some coaching on just saying we are sorry   offer a free donut for the trouble  something  i wont go back  but the staff needs help  it always falls on leadership  so maybe a new manager 
went here a couple weeks ago  excited to try a new place    the place was almost full  so that was a good sign  also  when i walked in i immediately noticed how good it smelled   i could smell freshly baked items and it all smelled great    i honestly dont remember what i ordered  frankly because it wasnt that great  it was good  but nothing that was memorable enough  their coffee was good though  ha  the service was so so  the waitress was friendly  but was really only there to take our order and deliver our food  no refills for our coffee or water were offered  no check ups on us to see if we were doing alright    on my way out  i noticed their case of baked good  the banana nutella muffin called out to me  so i ordered one  i was a bit disappointed  the muffin was moist and well made  but there wasnt much taste to it  when eaten with the nutella spread   the taste of the nutella just overpowered the muffin    all in all  i would go back if someone else suggests it and wants to eat there  but  i probably wont be the one to suggest the place if someone asks me for a place to eat 
this place is pretty nice  i dont live here  but have a friend that does so i visit once about every two weeks or so    for guests  it is a bit of a hassle to actually get inside  you have to stop by  the security gate and show photo id  and the guard usually takes about 5 minutes to write information down about you  i have no idea what they write  but it does take some time   the place offers a lounge for the residents and their guests  it includes a pool table  free coffee and hot chocolate and a tv  it also offers a movie theater which residents can reserve for certain times    overall  a nice place  very clean and the concierge is very friendly 
so  continuing on with my quest to find the best chicken fried steak in las vegas  plus the fact that my friend had a groupon   i finally got around to trying this place    as we walked in  we noticed that they were already cleaning up the restaurant  without realizing  we had accidentally come about half hour before their closing time  feeling bad  we asked if that was ok and said that we had no problem coming back another day  however  they were more than happy to still have us eat there  which was nice   i for one hate customers who come in an order at the last minute possible    naturally  i ordered the cfs  for  10 you get the steak   gravy  two eggs  choice of potato    choice of bread  the pricing was pretty decent  i got the apple fritter with mine  which i wasnt a big fan of  it was just too sweet for me  maybe next time  ill try the fried bread    as for the steak   it was good  cooked well  and wasnt chewy or rubbery  the breading on it was a little more thick than i prefer  but had good taste  and the gravy was decent  wasnt the best ive had   but it sufficed  while this place isnt my number one favorite for cfs  id still come back for their other food    everything was cooked well and had flavor and service was great  its a great place to go for breakfast 
about seven dollars for a steak and a beer  count me in  steak wasnt the best ive ever had  but for a price like that  i can deal with it  especially since you also get soup  salad  a dinner roll  and a potato  cooked in any of the usual ways  fried  mashed  baked     for you non alcoholic drinkers  their root beer is amazing  as for their beer  it may not be the best beer ever  but its pretty good   especially since its so cheap    one of the things i like most about this place  is you wont find very many tourists  hell  if i were a tourist and saw the place   i probably wouldnt want to go in considering how all of the other casinos look  so  this is a great local spot to go to  especially if youre broke    i go there mostly to drink  mainly because ive had some bad experiences in the cafe  i muster enough courage to go back in every now and then  but for the most part   its all about the gambling and drinking for me 
i had a spectacular experience  its one of the few restaurants i visited during restaurant week that i would actually go back to  im definitely going back there to try their tasting menu  8 courses of amazing food  yes please    we started off with cocktails while we waited for our table to finish being ready  they serve moscow mules there  which is one of my favorite cocktails  it was pretty decent pricing for being on the strip   17     like i said earlier  when i went i was there for restaurant week  everything i had was great  they even gave us a free amuse bouche and a free little dessert drink  we also ordered the beef tartar in addition to the pre fixe  im pretty sure we ate it all within a couple minutes    ill update this as soon as i go back and try the tasting menu  im not sure if the food offered during restaurant week is on their regular menu   so i dont want to dive too far into that  but  the food was all good enough to make me want to go back and try their regular items 
amazing hole in the wall restaurant with a huge menu   everything looks tasty  but we highly recommend their molletes as an appetizer   it comes with a great hot sauce  red or green  with red being spicier   that makes a great topping for the tortas too   the servings are huge and reasonably priced   a couple could easily split an appetizer and torta   i wanted to try the 10th anniversary carlos v food challenge  eat the thing in 15minutes and its free   but they werent offering the challenge anymore   at  25 for the torta carlos v  i decided to stick with the very popular torta del sol and was very pleased with my meal   i left absolutely stuffed   if youre looking for a smaller torta  we recommend the torta mexicana   it is similar to a fresh philly cheese steak with guacamole   they dont serve alcohol   however  the business is located on an extremely busy street with lanes that close from 4 6pm and i wouldnt order a drink  even if they offered them 
this will be my go to place for brazilian waxing  courtney is fantastic  she has a great personality and made the experience great  it was like chatting with a good friend  the location has reserved parking for clients  the inside was super clean and everyone was friendly   ive already scheduled my 4 week return visit   im glad i found waxing the city  im definitely a loyal customer after just one visit 
is it so wrong that im digging  this hotel  i know its virtually for a slightly more mature crowd  but its small and straight to the point  what i mean by this is  the tables arent all confusingly placed  they have food on one end  movie theatre on the other  its just very well organized and simple   the dealers are also by far the most friendliest ive handled  especially at the craps table and this dealer named debbie  who i put all my luck in  granted  i may have not won the big bucks  but it makes gambling more enjoyable    yes  its cigarette smelled  but what casino that offers  5 tables isnt  the cafe has hawaiian breakfast  the theatre isnt so bad  and they got an oyster bar  its a good casino to go to if youre local and not in the mood for a slightly more  upscale  red rock   oh and the seahawks won 
allow me to preface by saying that this place is worth the wait  hands down one of the best meals ive had in my entire life  this is not an understatement  the dishes are too die for  i kid you not  i nearly cried  orgasmed with the sensation of joy of the fresh oysters  clams  and their hearty stewy dishes like the boullabaise  the gumbo  and the pan roast  oh the pan roast   its a small little bar  so the wait can get lenghtly  food doesnt come out quick either so add that to the equation and you got yourself a hefty line  thank goodness its 24  7    we started with the seafood combo of 3 large raw oysters  3 large raw clams  and 3 shrimp cocktails  each was phenomenally delicious  juicy of the sea  yet not fishy  clearly  i was extremely impressed with this place  i loved the raw clams so much  i had to order a dozen more  and slurp them up with sauce  and fresh lemon squeezes  heavenly   the seafood pan roast was lovely  if youre like me and love a kick  level 6 is a good one  huge crab  lobster  and shrimp meat   with a tomato spice flavor  it was inexplicably sooooo delicious  i do recommend requesting the white rice on the side   its quite affordable for the luscious flavors and sinfully delicious experience youre gonna get  i already miss it  take me with you 
look  this place got me hook line sinker  for just  1  you can get a cardboard polaroid of some of your favorite pictures straight out of instagram  fb  or from your phone  if you love instant gratification and memories and photos  this fotobar rocks   if youre trying to get more out of it  thats when it can get pricey  the additions like a frame  or collage embellishments can tack on 
i am an out of towner    positives   there is a womens workout room   ample space   lots of machines   not too crowded  knock on wood    kids play area  for you mommas   negatives  the staff aint too friendly  but that could just be the vegas humdrum vibe i get everytime i visit 
there is a reason why this place is sooo cheap  the food   for two its less than  11 for breakfast  you cant beat that deal  sure  but the food    oh the food    did i lose my appetite oh too quick      cant complain though  i got what i paid for  you really cant beat a buffet for  4 95 
wowzas  this is my new favourite ice cream  chocolate shop  my initial impression was that this place was a bit overpriced  a  mini  ice cream was   4  and that its only real specialty was that it had different flavoured dips  having looked at the menu posted on yelp  i was excited to try the maple ice cream but was disappointed to learn that it was removed  just chocolate  vanilla  orange  and strawberry soft serve at the moment   i decided to try out the strawberry soft serve with cookies and cream dip  sounds like a good combo  in a  mini  size   when i took my first bite  i was blown  away  the cookies and cream chocolate dip was soooooooooooo thick i feel like ive never had an ice cream cone dip like that before  this is not your typical ice cream truck dip  it was a good 2 3mm of yummy milk chocolate covering your soft serve  the chocolate dip was also exactly like a cookies and cream bar  it felt like i was eating ice cream and a whole bar at the same time  as some have mentioned  the chocolate is quite sweet  but id rather have my chocolate sweet than not  plus  the strawberry ice cream  which paired really well with the cookies and cream  helped even out the sweetness   overall  the  mini  size was more than enough for me  making the price quite worth it   they also have a vast array of chocolates  including belgian chocolates and some matcha flavoured ones   as well as gelato and milkshakes  im pretty excited to try those out soon   its been a few days since i visited  and im still telling my friends and family how awesome the cone dips were  im definitely bringing my family  friends here when im in the area again 
when i found out there was a chatime finally opening up north in markham    well  more north    i was very happily excited  i am an extreme chatime fan    coco what   this chatime is opened along with bake code  so instead of the usual purple theme in most chatime places  this store is decorated with wooden walls  wooden displays  for the buns   i really like it   i ordered a hot taro milk tea during their buy 1 get 1 free promo  the drink itself was decent but when i compare it to other locations i feel it is missing that  taro  flavour  that  one thing  that takes it to another level  you know     i also took a sip of the roasted milk tea w   grass jelly and it was also missing a bit of that intense roasted tea taste that i love  grass jelly was decent   not too hard nor slimy    i found the cashier to be quite rude  now  i know this isnt a fancy restaurant and so i shouldnt expect much service  but when i asked about their bogo deal and if it was any drink  psa  its not   and their email did not state youre limited to 3 drinks   she was very annoyed and even rolled her eyes at me  ouch  i never had rudeness problems in other chatime locations    lastly  considering this is a chatime   bakecode store   their selection of bread  buns was not very extensive but very expensive  also a lot of their displays were empty  though the reason for that may be because they are still new   anyways  because of the missing  flavours  of their drinks  rudeness from that one cashier  and lack of selection for a bun store  i didnt think this chatime deserved any more than 3 stars compared to the warden  gibson location which still remains my favourite for its consistency  i will be coming back for the love of chatime   but until the lines die down ill head over to warden 
the food is not very good  i got this butter chicken rice and it was nothing like curry at all  the chicken was weird too   kinda spongy  cheddar broccoli soup is very average  their spinach dip is average  their calamari almost feels like its not fried enough    what i do come to symposium for is their desserts  their waffles are big and affordable and quite delicious  they also have this cookie with melted chocolate inside and topped with ice cream  its good enough   although the edge of the cookie is quite hard  which makes me think it was a frozen premade cookie that they just threw in the microwave  ambience is good   service is pretty bad  the waiters barely ever come around to check up on how youre doing or refill water  and most of the waiters seem anti social which isnt the best trait for someone in the service industry to have  am i expecting too much   this is just a really  below  average restaurant 
pretty decent ramen that is not coming from your usual chain  franchise ramen restaurants  i ordered the hokkaido ramen and the soup was very flavourful  similar to a tonkotsu ramen  and the noodles were well done  what was nice was that their ramen came with more toppings compared to other ramen joints  but i found their chashu to be a little rough and not nearly as flavourful as kintons    they also have other dishes such as the unagi don  which was deliciously made   as well as sushi dishes  too    although koi sakana is not my favourite ramen restaurant  it is quite worth it for the price  and they have take out which is perfect for those who work around the area 
when wooffles first came out  i thought it was nothing but hype  try it once  good enough  but with so many reviews  wooffles is still able to maintain such a high rating because they are really good  their matcha ice cream is so creamy  and has the perfect balance of sweet matcha and authentic tea taste  but nothing too bitter  their houjicha ice cream is even more yummy as there is even more of a tea taste to it  i honestly crave their soft serve ice cream constantly because it is better than anything ive had around here  they also load up your waffles with as much soft serve as possible    wait time for your waffle ice cream can take from 5 10 minutes  and it can feel a bit long when youre craving their desserts  but i can see that the 2 girls working this small space really put their time to ensuring that the waffles are crispy on the outside  soft on the inside  quality over everything  their waffles are on the eggier tasting side  making their waffles more unique than the others ive tried   but i feel it complements the ice cream very well    only downside is that the dessert itself is quite pricey  ringing up to  7 or more  depending on what you get   does it stop me from spending that money though     no way  this place is the best for hk egg waffle   ice cream 
kaka is pretty good for all you can eat  they have some pretty awesome desserts  creme brulee  etc  and their mango slush works well as a drink during the feast   their torched sushi  the main attraction  is quite delicious and has interesting flavours  and the cooked food is fairly good too  you cant expect their torched sushi to be as delicious as  for example  jabistros because kaka is an ayce restaurant  so again  its pretty good for ayce    there isnt much service since youre gonna be ordering from an ipad so the servers are really only there to give you your dishes and clear your table    what i dont like is that they seem to always have dishes that are unavailable  in fact a lot of them are unavailable or ive never had a chance to try it because its never been available  take it off the menu or make more for your customers to try    in general  kaka is prob my go to ayce restaurant  of course  if i manage to get a table  because it is pretty good   for all you can eat  on the weekends id probably head over to tenichi because they have sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi   other special dishes for around the same weekend price 
definitely five stars for this place   whats that  you want to know more   let me tell you    an amazing wine list  with champagnes and all wines  5 per glass during happy hour   and amazing appetizers and salads   the most amazing  friendly  and funny staff i have seen in years  a beautiful interior  great location  and absolutely fabulous outdoor patio   yes   please   i wish i would have found this place sooner during my travels  i would have ate here every single meal     parking is plentiful in gilbert streets   is there a down side   well  the menu descriptions  and ingredient choices  are woefully hipster   that may turn off some   the food and drink we had  however  was fantastic 
creative  unique food  in a beautiful  beautiful setting   the waiters and front desk staff were unstuffy  cool and very helpful and friendly     if theres a weak spot  its probably the food  although its beautifully presented   it just didnt seem to  wow  the flavor senses   pricing is fair for what you get 
a beautiful beautiful hotel  with the same room layout like the palms  and a little bit easier to get in and out of with valet  no casino  etc   the staff are all gorgeous and very very helpful   the rooms are high tech and very sophisticated in design    it would be great to have more choices than one relatively small restaurant  and a tiny bar  rojo  in the room  and its a long walk via something they call the  sky tube    which is  it should be noted  neither in the sky nor a tube  to the palms  where the action is at   the jacuzzi tub and rain from the sky shower is great    enjoyed this stay quite a bit 
i visited red robin with my husband and daughter to try out some of their new burgers  when we walked in  the restaurant smelled like something rotting  the waitress that sat us was wearing a pair of see through leggings as pants  i could see her underwear  we sat  and to accompany the awful smell  was a layer of grime on the booth  the walls  the table    it was disgusting  there were crumbs squished into the crevices of the booth as if it had never been properly cleaned  then  against my better judgement because my daughter was really hungry  we ordered  my daughters burger came with tomato on it  despite the fact that she ordered the burger without them  she is allergic  and my husbands burger was not fully cooked  cold in the middle  with stale buns for all of us  the buns actually fell apart to the touch  we ended up eating a buttload of bottomless fries and going somewhere else for a proper meal  it was disgusting to say the least 
came by this little place for a hot bowl of noodles after snowboarding for a day  saturday night  surprisingly not as busy as i thought but it could be the weather  anyway  we waited 15 mins for a table  for those of you who have never been here before  there is no waiting space  super limited seating  but the good thing is turnover is fast  staff on the whole are quite friendly   we ordered the original and also the miso this time  though the miso was light  it felt thicker than the original broth regular  anyway  ramen was cooked al dente just the way i like it  the gyoza came after the noodles  we ordered a combo each   they did not disappoint  but my only negative comment was as good as that mayo was  i did not appreciate it drenched over my gyoza  perhaps if they drizzle less or just serve it on the side it might be better  anyway all in all it was a good meal  the noodles are delicious  but if only the place was a bit bigger and not mostly bar seating it would be even better   
ive come here on a number of occasions for my dinner talks and i love this little gem  their food is always super delicious and the service is always great   i ve tried their crab cake  delish  love their seafood pasta  it is so good that i manage to convince my 5 other coworkers to try it next time we went back    ive also tried a number of their desserts  including tiramisu  so good  and creme brulee   make room for this baby because it is huge  but they use vanilla bean in the dessert so i love eating this  their chicken is also surprising super juicy and not dry at all  and their beef is always done right  which sometimes its very hard to get even at a steakhouse  its really sad that they are changing the restaurant again as they cant seem to keep up the business with fine dining  not enough of a niche here i suppose   the owners also own amici in whitby and pickering which is also just as good    love the atmosphere and the amazing food  gem in hiding   will miss you 
i booked this dinner for my 30th birthday and also to celebrate getting engaged earlier that day and i am sad to say that i was quite disappointed  i tried their paella at taste of toronto last year and had been wanting to go to the restaurant to try the whole dish  i came here for their paella only to be told that i need to wait 1 5 hours for it for an 8 30 reservation because all their pans are used up  they didnt tell me that when i booked my table  i couldve appreciated the heads up  however we did try some of the other recommendations our waitress made  they were generally quite good and in the end we were quite full and satisfied  food is tasty  not too salty  i wouldve loved to try the paella though  ambience is nice but i found it a bit too noisy  may give the paella a try down the road but will probably have to make sure i go at an earlier time in order to secure a pan for paella 
first time to write a review for a really nice place  the all you can eat sushi makes me so happy and satisfied  much better than most expansive buffets in las vegas strip  not only oysters and sea urchin  every appetizer will simply amaze you  definitely come here again next time 
placeholder rating  the lady is very nice and the food is great and reasonably priced  super lucky to live a few blocks away from here  pad thai is awesome but thai kitchen down the street definitely is overall better and more authentic 
amazing local business  not just lumber but plenty of things around the house  tiles  flooring  doors  windows  custom glass cutting  they will do it all  not just for contractors  im a home owner and while its definitely geared towards them  i find the store navigable enough and the expertise is unmatched  definitely check here before home depot because the door i just ordered from cleveland lumber was  280 instead of  350 at home depot and cleveland lumber got it in one week  hd estimated 2 4 weeks 
every time it snows you can be sure brennans will not shovel their sidewalk  its been 4 5 days since it snowed and theres pure ice in front of their storefront  its the same every time it snows  a business that does not care about the community is not one i am willing to support 
amazing grocery store  selection and prices are great  and the workers are all incredibly friendly even if they barely speak english  even if theres trouble in communicating  they will keep trying to help you or find someone who can   butcher  fresh foods counter  dried goods  everything is fantastic here but unfortunately the produce isnt always the best  most of the time its ok but occasionally ill come here and the green onions and cilantro look sad  if it was just a grocery store  that would mean 3 5 4  5 but the hot food counter is so good that it raises it to 4 5  5 for me 
wow  what a great place  this is the epitome of a hole in the wall  but the guy running the place is super nice and friendly  credit card machine wasnt working and he told me where the closest atm was  it had a  1 fee and he gave me a  1 discount off my food without even asking   theres only one table on the inside  probably take your food to go if its cold outside  theres a patio with a decent amount of seating in front of the restaurant  the menu has quite a few options  check out my photos of it  judging by the tape over the menu  it seems like it changes quite a bit or some items are seasonal  there was a grill on the outside  maybe some taped off items involved that    i didnt try it but they had sweet potato pie if you have a sweet tooth  wasnt on the main menu   they also had a few jamaican sodas  the menu has a good variety of dishes and some you wont find anywhere else   from what ive gathered  the food is authentic jamaican home style cooking  it was delicious  but make sure youre ready for those bones  i got a  small  goat curry and a large braised oxtails to share with my wife  i love goat in general and the goat curry was great  it wasnt as strong as indian curry  but it was still very flavorful  the braised oxtails were excellent as well  both were served with a side of cabbage  rice  and beans  i dont know how to explain the cabbage  but i enjoyed it more than i thought i would   ill be back for sure 
worst most overpriced place ever   horrible food and inconvenient service  stay away 
ok buffet  40 bucks   extremely crowded and very long lines make for a so so experience   i had a line pass but if i didnt  there would be no way i would stand in line for an hour to give them  40 bucks to eat an ok buffet   ive eaten at other places that are better and cheaper but there is something about the folks bragging that they ate at the bellagio that makes this some sort of mecca   not a must do 
decent buffet but lines can exceed 40 or 50 people on a weekday at 1 pm   its not the bellagio and im not going to wait 45 minutes for a mediocre buffet 
clearly the secrets out and everyone knows that the bun bo hue  spicy beef noodle is fantastic especially with pigs feet  but what also blew me away were the perfectly charbroiled pork rolls    btw i love how the staff get to know the customers and know what i want   
as bad as it gets    biryani is just average   u can get better biryani in kabob palace or chennai fusion in chandler and chennai chettinad or mayuri palace in north phoenix 
excellent service    i took them my iphone 5s which wasnt charging and they fixed it in 10 minutes  it was a very quick fix and they also didnt charge me anything  the problem was that my iphone 5s wasnt charging when usiing the original apple charging block  it suprisingly only works   charges with non apply charging blocks 
this is by far the best middle east restaurant i have ever been to  i have read a lot of good reviews of this place and it lives up to it  the hummus is simply superb  it with the bread melts in the mouth  and i had chicken shawarma which was delicious   the service was fast and courteous  i moved from san jose   ca and with the restaurant options up there i had hard time finding good ones here in tempe  well here is one i love to go over and over again 
enter a seemingly simple building  the interior boost of simple elegance  just well done enough it look classy  we where greeted by the manager and the chef came to greet us to make sure they could accommodate our gluten free requirements  all the staff was very attentive and service was friendly  anticipating every need you had  the food was amazing  we enjoyed several dishes as appetizers and some of main course portions  when the octopus was served my dining companion asked for it again instead of desert  it was marinated for 6 hours and then cooked vacuum sealed  these guys know what they are doing  the korean french fusion is done in a young a sophisticated way  unlike anything else in the city  job well done   of all the places i have been to in toronto this would be the best  highly recommended
great back patio   tucked away from old town  enjoyed the mushroom flatbread and big kale salad  spicy margarita is recommended  excellent service and friendly staff 
ive never seen an indian  afghan restaurant serving so tasteless  poor quality food to its customer  this place is surely overrated  i went there on 10  11  2017 and ordered beef nihari  goat biriyani  both the items were nowhere near the actual thing  nihari had a foul smell in it and biriyani was tasteless and goat meat was hard  they didnt even use any biriyani masala in it  there was too much cilantro in the biriyani which was disgusting  totally disgraceful to authentic indian  afghan food  im an indian  i know the taste of food  these people are just using the name and fame of indian  afghan food to make easy money  their cook should learn how to cook indian food  also  the place is smelly  not suitable for spending quality time with family  friends  if you dont believe me  please go there at your own risk and see for yourself 
great staff  nice little bar attached  rooms are nice and updated  easy parking  just make sure you stop and register before you park your car  the fitness center is rather small  but open 24 hours 
yikes  literally  this was like entering the twightlight zone or a time machine  it looks  feels  and smells exactly like someones basement  but not saying thats a bad thing 
good food  good service  2 people can eat for  30   tax   tip   drinks   turkey sandwich stuffed with cheese and other veggies is awesome   spicy fries    its a casual place  have good food while cheering for your fav team    one star less because there is no enclosed section for bar   smoking 
i absolutely love pole fitness studio and  so pleased with the new studio  all of the instructors are seriously amazing and supportive  i especially love taras morning classes they are so fun and i get such a good workout  she has helped me improve so much in just a few weeks and even helped me choreograph  there are less people at this location and higher poles  i have been with pole fitness since january 2015 and have always had a positive experience 
cool vibe and best restaurant in town square  hands down  the best brisket sandwich  i crave it all hours of the day  huge portions  yummy cocktails  nice staff  what more could you ask for 
it wont be the food that makes this place go out of business  it will be the service    lets start off with the good  the food  probably the best in madison by a good margin  typical dim sum dishes but they are tasty  if youve eaten dim sum in chicago  or texas  or ca  you will still be happy    now the bad  the service  its horrible and if this place ever closes  i wouldnt be surprised if this was the reason  the service is bad  i had to raise my hand multiple times to get attention  i almost wanted to walk into the kitchen to get my own water  and to refill it  i understand it takes for certain dishes  but i dont see an excuse for any dish to come near an hour later from sitting or when you are about to pay  at least a continuous update is acceptable if its taking too long 
love how spacious this place is  it can fit all sizes of groups which is why its never a hassle to stop by    we always get the parrilladas combination because it feeds about 4 ppl  order extra beans  rice per person and youll be set for an awesome meal    the salsas do lack in flavor  the regular salsa they normally bring out is undesirable  while the requested  spicy  salsa is water down and flavorless 
it is a smaller airport but still has everything you need to make sure you feel comfortable  plenty of spots to plug in and work or just charge your tablets 
we have been extremely pleased with the care and attention given to our dog bernie at spring harbor  we brought him to dr  waller after about a year of various vets trying to help with his allergies  dr  waller listened to what we had to say with patience and understanding  and provided several options for treatment  after testing we began immunotherapy in may  and so far we have seen great results  bernie goes in once to twice a week to see dr  waller  2 shots per appointment   and each time he is excited to see her  to see that her attention and care are enough to make getting two shots ok to a very anxious dog has meant the world to us  the staff always responds to online appointment requests within 24 hours and is nothing but kind and courteous in person  we would suggest spring harbor to anyone  and will keep taking bernie there for as long as we are in madison 
i love the draft house  it is huge   just ridiculously spacious  i came here with my husband and family during the first week of the march madness tournament  and we were able to find a place where my husband could watch like 3 different games  but where we could still hear each other talk  pretty rare this time of year   the menu is as big as the restaurant  theres really something for everyone  ive had the wings  great   and santa fe wrap  and loved both  beer selection is large but relatively common  all drinks and food are very reasonably priced  nice large patio for summer and awesome service 
this is a fantastic park for quiet night walks  daily exercise  and family fun  the scenery is beautiful with lots of palm trees over a pretty lake  plenty of gazebos for picnics and shade  awesome playground and water park for the kids  and a very safe atmosphere in general  as a smaller 25 year old i feel completly safe walking my dog alone on the walking path through the park  only complaint is the stray cat population that seems to continue to grow  but they keep to themselves so if you go during the day its not too bad 
we came here with some friends on a sunday for drinks  the bartender was very kind and attentive  we enjoyed talking with him while we had our drinks  i feel a bit biased since im a hefeweizen girl and they had no wheat beers on tap  but i wasnt super excited about my sour  my husband liked his lager  and our friend enjoyed his stout  the inside was clean and the atmosphere was casual  we wish there was a bigger patio since the group of 4 that was out there kind of overtook the space  all in all it was a good place for one drink  but not my favorite brew pub in madison 
i am writing this review mostly because i dont think the others are fair to this restaurant   i have been a patron since it opened and visit usually once per month   i have experienced nothing but friendly  accurate and speedy service   therefore  i was surprised to read that others apparently havent had the same treatment     mary browns fried chicken is not as crispy as kfc or popeyes   however  the meat itself and not just the coating is  overall  tastier than the aforementioned chains   mary browns has arguably the tastiest chicken breat pieces for those who are fans of white meat   because their marinade is likely some sort of brine  in my experience  their white meat pieces have never  ever been dry   what is also notable about the way they prepare their chicken  unlike all other chicken chains i can think of  is that all pieces are trimmed of excess fat and skin prior to preparation   for those wishing to try their signature dishes without spending a lot  they have daily lunch specials under six bucks   everyone has different prefernces   however  taking process and care into consideration  a fried chicken  foodie  would probably understand why mary browns has a loyal following 
their in restaurant menu is not the entire menu they have at tomasos or the one posted on the open table website so that was disappointing    our server  michael  was great  we enjoyed a very nice bottle of oregon pinot noir  the ambience is nice  but a lot of hard surfaces mean its very loud and echoey for a white tablecloth kind of place  the laminate flooring and faux carrara marble in the bathroom suggest some skimping on finishes that show    the cioppino pasta was fair  most of the seafood was cooked nicely except the lobster which was tough and very overcooked  the sauce was watery  being from san francisco  i still feel like cioppino should be a stew and the tomato broth should be packed with flavor  the chicken parmigiana was a better dish but still overpriced for quality   the tab for value means we probably wont be back but i can see how it might appeal to a certain audience 
i was so looking forward to lous opening  granted im not from chicago and wasnt terribly familiar with the purported  chicago style   but was hoping it would be a good substitute for zacharys pizza from berkeley where we are from  we picked it up to go last night and got a deep dish with some veggie toppings and butter crust  the gal taking my order by phone sounded like a ditzy teenager and was not knowledgeable about the menu or particularly helpful  every question i asked was relayed back to someone else before replying  we also ordered the malnati salad  when we got the pizza home i found it pretty under cooked  pale  anemic and soggy on the bottom  it didnt really seem very  deep  for a deep dish   kind of sad actually  a thin layer of cheese and sauce   more of the crust than anything else  it had a strange metallic taste   canned tomatoes   and really needed salt  overall very blah  the salad was generous and fresh   the medium was more than enough for two people to share and i liked the dressing  my two stars is based mostly on the salad and cutting them a bit of slack because maybe i just  dont get it   ill stick with my wood fired pizzas from bianco and parlor  oh well   
one of the best barber shop in las vegas   the master barbers always doing a perfect clean cut   gill and lou always respecting the costumers and they always on time for next appointment   
ive had az dukes of air maintain our 19 year old systems since we moved here almost a year ago  the units were working fine  though highly inefficient   even though we are on their maintenance program  it was in the back of my mind all summer that the units were past their useful life and could die anytime  leaving us sweltering     at the last tune up with brian m   he advised the refrigerant in our old units was going to be increasingly harder to find and more expensive to replace  recharge   though it is a sealed system  if a major component such as the compressor went out  this would get pricey quick  he also shared the trane financing specials  though i didnt use those    called robert bowen a couple weeks later   his was the second bid we received  the first contemplated rebuilding our furnaces and replacing the ac units   roberts bid was only  2 000 more and the seer rating was at least two points better with the matched units   just over a week later  we had manny  freddie  beto  luis and danny at our home  replacing both attic mounted furnaces and the ac compressors   great job  cleaned up well and they were done completely in about 6 hours total       the units are less than half as noisy   both the furnace and compressors  plus from the srp records  they seem at least half as expensive to run     thanks all who helped us with this replacement  highly recommend these guys to anyone needing hvac service or replacement 
incredible tapas in a great atmosphere and excellent service  the best meal in vegas before going to see cirque de soleil  o 
here on a thursday evening  fast service  cashier is very welcoming  always a smile on her face  food is very tasty and the carne asada fries are always on point  make sure to stop by for your lunch  you wont be disappointed
opening day  ive been driving past and waiting for this to open and today is the day  and its been going great    walked in the door to find its more spacious than any other pranch ive been to  welcomed at the door by someone from the corporate office  friendly staff everywhere  food was hot and ready  and most importantly  excellent  pizza crust was perfect  chicken was perfect    only recommendation  get those dessert pizzas out early  i like to eat dessert first  just to make sure theres room    cant wait to be a regular here  way to go guys  keep it up   update  the dessert pizza was hiding in plain sight right behind me 
amazing   this place has the real stuff  from regular dishes to sushi sashimi   everything tasted so good  only thing i can think of that can improve is having more sashimi selection and warm crab legs instead of cold  other than that  its prefect  definite 4 8
cool lil dive bar with great theme of world war 2 era gangsters and mafia icons the newly redesigned bar looks great with nice vintage diamond tucked bench seating and open floor plan decent drink offers they have a nice lillte kitchen havent eaten in it but can only imagine its bar food material but there are many great places to eat around the joint pretty bartenders and with locals buzzing around your not shy of entertainment in that area so 5 stars for this hopping joint stay classy yelpers
ive been coming into ryan and his crew since i moved here from sf in 05 and they always treat me well and honor there work they do alot of community work and charity runs woudnt ever go anywhere else unless i get rich then id buy the place 
our first time there  and i have to say that i was very impressed  the food was great and they had vegan options for my wife  i thought the prices were reasonable as well  we will definitely be going back 
clearly  theyre doing something right  because i was back within a week  this time got a great white with mushrooms  of note  the white pie  duh  doesnt have the red sauce of which i was so fond  so i got to experience a whole different side of fatsos  i just have to say  im hooked  this place has a completely unique taste and i love it  strongly recommend the great white  im craving it now  but im going to be the size of a house if i eat here as often as i want to 
this review concerns the urgent care and specifically dr  mcshane  or something along those lines   went in wednesday sick as a dog  he treated me like a drug seeker  i would know  i worked in a pharmacy for some time   didnt listen to my symptoms and now three days later im significantly worse  called the office and broke down crying out of frustration and pain and he begrudgingly agreed to give me a z pack when i just told him  in broken sentences  that i cant swallow  how im going to take it i have no idea  do not waste your time here  hes going to tell you to drink lots of water and get lots of rest  meantime your infection will get worse and youll feel like me 
breakfast burritos were so so  especially for the price  glad we tried it but wish we had made our own at home instead 
our experience with cost plus 20  was the best   wed been saving for a while  and knew floor tile installation can be expensive   in the end  we feel our money was well spent   jeff  our sales associate was truly engaged in our project  he helped us find the flooring look we wanted   however  it didnt stop at selling us tile and scheduling an install   he came to our house to get measurements  helped us think about wall colors for after the floor project  and helped us stay within our project budget   in addition to helping select our floor tile  jeff stayed in touch during the installation  and inspected the work while it was ongoing   speaking of the installation  our installers  led by elder and omar were master craftsmen   their attention to detail was superb   they didnt just glue down the tile  they took care to develop an installation plan  made sure we liked the lines  and set goals for the work which they kept us informed of   their intricate cuts around door jams and baseboards proved their skill  and added value to our floor work   the install crew had some junior tradesmen on our project  but elder and omar directed and maintained a constant oversight of their work     its been two months since the work was done  and we have had zero warranty issues   i dont know why my review is so much different on this company than the others  we walked into cost plus 20  on a chance   we had visited everyone else  and appreciated the way jeff cared but wasnt pushy   in fact  he prompted us to lead  our project      if you want a completely positive  full service  flooring installation experience and prices competitive to the big box and closeout stores  go see jeff at cost plus 20 
i want to like this place since it is close to home   but  the food was just okay  the pad thai was alright and the crab rangoon was actually wonderful  but overall i find the favors lacking  i will try it again with the hopes i just chose the wrong entree 
yes  yes  yes  a great collaboration amongst local farms and entrepreneurs  this is what phoenix needs  support local 
its hard to believe that within a few blocks of  little italy    you cant get a decent pie delievered  we ordered two   all dressed   which is basically pepperoni  green peppers and onions  additional toppings are  5 a pop    delivery was fast so they get a point for that  driver had a debit card reader which is nice  but they charge an additional  fee  to use it    as for the pies themselves  they looked like plastic displays you might see in a glass cabinet  the kind they use to show you how wonderful their products are    the same way an embalmer might show off his work  the toppings were paper thin  and by paper thin  i mean single ply asswipe  we had one with sausage added and it tasted like a hot dog that had been boiled in old sock water  the whole thing was a greasy mess and it had a real foul odor   breaking into the dough was a bland  gooey white blob you might use to patch a leaky pipe  oh and the grease  half an inch deep of it  swirling around the box   whats most shocking about this experience  as we sat speechless and looked at what they sent us  someone actually thinks this is edible or somehow desirable  for  45 i dont expect imported calabrese peppers but a frozen pie out of a box would have been much more nutritious  tasty and at a fraction of the cost   pizzeria villeray ties for first place as worst pizza ever 
souvlaki is one of the best things about being in montreal  and smoked meat  and bagels   but you come to elatos for the souvlaki and gyro  its consistently excellent    the dining area is cramped  if you live in the area you can treat yourself to delievery but it can take a long time during peak hours  average times are 45 minutes to an hour  from our experience over the years    if you place a take out order  confirm the order and check it when it arrives  on many occasions orders have been wrong but theyre quick to correct   dining area is small  with 3 4 large booths  in house service is fast but with the open grill  it can get very foggy   overall an excellent place to grab a quick lunch and  hands down  treat yourself to the souvlaki  thats the star attraction  here    best bet is to get a takeout order and head to nearby jarry park for a picnic  summer done right    4 stars for the food  minus 1 for still not having an effective pos for orders 
why did i originally give duck and decanter a four star rating    so much ridiculous  this is my favorite lunch spot in the entire city  i love their deli options  i love the people  i love the seating  both indoor and out   and i love love love their sandwiches  if youve never been here  you need to try it  it is the perfect deli  look for me when you visit  im pretty much a regular   
so i am definitely not rich enough to be regular member of gainey village   or any village for that matter  however  for a special treat  my husband booked us a couples massage at the gainey village spa recently    so my review is a little biased because up until this point i was a professional massage virgin  yep  thats right  i had never before had a professional massage  pretty crazy  huh  i have to admit that i was surprisingly nervous about going in for my first massage  i didnt really know what to expect  but had heard that it was a romantic experience that sometimes ended in a warm bath together  that initially sounded a little weird to me  but decided it might be kind of fun  i was a little disappointed when the couples massage turned out to be just that  a couples massage  we both laid in a room together and had a simultaneous massage  so that was a little disappointing  but i have to say that the massage itself was so relaxing that it didnt matter what my expectations had been    i really wish that i could remember the name of my masseuse because she was great  upon telling her that it was my first massage she immediately went out of her way to make me feel comfortable  she was warm  friendly  and checked on me regularly to make sure i was relaxed and enjoying myself  plus  she was quite talented with her hands  yes  im aware that sound dirty  but im okay with it   i couldnt have asked for someone better    the spa locker room is also something that deserves comment  its pretty damn awesome  theres a lovely sitting room with plenty of complimentary beverages  magazines  and comfy chairs  i wanted to try out the steam room  but went with what i knew   the sauna  the showers were clean and heavenly and they had every toiletry i could have needed  i could have spent all afternoon just lounging in that locker room    so  i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed my first spa experience  i hope to have many more 
ive tried a gazilion salons around town and im so relieved to tell you im sticking with shampoo ink  heres the scoop     heidi is awesome  pretty sure were friends from another life  plus shes ridiculously    good at her job   duh    their prices are average  not too high  not too low    theyre located in central phoenix so all those fake blondes can stay up in    scottsdale    theyve got some funky ambiance going on    they offer drinks   and yes  that includes beer    did i mention how awesome heidi is  im obsessed with her   thanks to yelp for helping me find this place  love it 
i am a regular tjs visitor  they have their pros and their cons  but i keep going back because the quality of their food is excellent and their prices are super affordable    some of my favorites  pesto tortellini bowl  so good and perfect for lunch   excellent array of protein  snack bars  love me some luna   lychee  the only store i know of to sell it   when its in season   tasty on the vine tomatoes  and their olive oil popcorn makes the perfect snack  i also really love that you can mix and match bottles of beer to make your own six pack  great idea   all in all  i love trader joes  my only complaint is that their produce isnt always the best  it tends to be somewhat bruised or too ripe so id rather go elsewhere for my fruit  but my weekly tjs visits will definitely continue 
marcellas does have its downside  but today im in a good mood and i am recommending you stop in for the following three reasons   1   they bring absolutely delicious bread  including olive oil  to your table almost immediately  i love this and i love their bread   2   you can sit on a  patio  inside the mall and have the most amazing people watching experience  fashion square shoppers can be quite entertaining   3   the amalfi spritzer might just be my favorite cocktail of all time  vodka   passion fruit   basil   heaven  plus  they use those cute little cylinder shaped ice cubes that somehow make the drink even better 
i headed to twirl to see if i could find a wedding dress that wasnt quite so  weddingish   i didnt want something that was extremely expensive or fancy  i was looking for casual and comfortable   and hopefully somewhat affordable    even though they only had a small rack of wedding dresses  they mostly sell bridesmaid dresses   i found several that were actually decent options  more so than any of the other wedding shops ive visited with racks and racks of dresses    if youre looking for something a little less formal and a little more affordable  twirl really has some good options  i am very picky and still found several that i liked  i even went back a second time to try on one of the dresses  i ended up going with a dress from a different store  check out my nm review   but i was really pleased with my overall experience at twirl    during both of my visits i was treated very well  all the girls that helped me were so friendly and helpful  they took pictures for me and chatted like we were old acquaintances  it was great  the dresses were in great condition and not torn or dirty like some stores    i would definitely recommend checking out twirl if youre looking for cute bridesmaid dresses or informal wedding dresses    
i love ticoz for an after work or evening hangout    the food that ive nibbled on was decent  but their mojitos are what bring me back time and time again  blood orange  pineapple  lychee  passion fruit    oh god  i love them all    the service here is great and ive never had a bad experience  i love sitting in the bar area   such a fun vibe    i will definitely have to head on over again soon to finally test out an actual meal  who wants food after work when you can have drinks anyway   
im kind of on a paleo lite diet right now  and that means ive been eating a lot more meat  and eating a lot more of it means im getting a lot pickier  even the select stuff at smiths isnt really cutting it anymore  but i had found that the organic grass fed ribeyes at smiths are pretty good  theyre a little pricier at   12  pound  but the real problem is that theyre not always available  in order to find a better selection  and support a local business    i ventured over to branded  they definitely have a great selection of beef   prime  select  and choice   and a handful of seafood options on the day i was there  on the butchers recommendation  i went for the select ribeye for  i think    15  pound  it was excellent  my husband and i both loved the flavor  and i find that price reasonable for a good steak  in addition  the seabass i got was really good  too  although definitely higher priced at  25  lb   my only complaint would be that their steaks are all grass fed  but grain finished  after trying it  though  im pretty sure ill be back any time i want steak 
its high priced  but you cant beat the selection   seriously  if you are planning any projects with kids  including babies  toddlers   lakeshore has all the supplies you need  or you could just buy a ready made project kit and not even have to mess with the supplies  but yes  it is overpriced  i think if you know what you want  and have the patience  you could get everything cheaper online 
ive been wanting to try sasapops for a long time  but never made it out to catch up with them  nor could i find it at whole foods    anyway  i was pleasantly surprised to see their shop inside the container park when i took my daughters to browse the shops and play on the playground   they had a decent selection of popsicles and mini pops and we decided to share one of an asian fruit  i forget the name  but the owner accurately described it as a cross between an orange  lime  and grapefruit  the pop was delicious  made of natural ingredients  and only slightly overpriced   3 for a mini i think    bonus points for being a local business   note  just before christmas it was cash only 
fun  but not really funny     we got free tickets to see carrot top and i definitely enjoyed going to see the show  but i dont think its really on par with your average las vegas strip show  of course  you probably know that hes a prop comic  so everything is kind of a pun  represented by some crazy gadget he glued together  as its really tough to string together multiple props  the main part of the show is one liners  actually  i thought his best stuff was when he was making fun of himself   either his looks or his popularity or comparing himself to criss angel  also  he had a lot of funny clips of other people making fun of him which were pretty good  prices start at  60 and go up  which is just way too much to pay for this show  i was happy going for free  and would have enjoyed it equally for up to  20  ticket  but more than that  and youll probably be disappointed 
the food was pretty good   kinda fancy american style   i was really excited about the location because its kinda on a hill with this huge patio upstairs  unfortunately  they closed the patio and put curtains over all the windows  what      i would have loved to come here and sit in the patio  enjoying the view and weather with a drink  i guess theyre more focused on the gaming  too bad because what could be a cool neighborhood bar is now just a pts with a red interior  oh and to top it all off  its smoky as hell inside  probably wont be back 
i love that bike shop is a locally owned place that really cares about the local biking community  they have a full calendar of group rides  and they host special events like ladies night where they have vendors in with specials and they go over simple maintenance  etc   i have gotten excellent advice from them  even when it didnt result in a sale  the service is reasonably priced and the staff is very knowledgeable  but they do have a tendency to get backed up  i recently had to wait an entire week just to get a wheel trued  a process that probably took them about 20 minutes  the shop has a decent selection of apparel and accessories  but they are extremely overpriced  i might go there to look at something  but then i would turn around and buy it on amazon or bikenashbar  same is true with their bikes   all very expensive 
im a beginning golfer  so long par 5 holes are beyond challenging for me  actually  when youre already on your 4th shot and can barely see the green  you might go beyond discouraged to actually pissed  lucky for me  desert willow is an executive course with no par 5s  the grass is kept in good condition and the staff is friendly  i never feel rushed or embarassed for not being very good  which is important  or i wouldnt keep playing  on top of all that  its not too far from my house  and its pretty cheap  hoping to be out there a lot more often  now that the weathers getting nice 
i swear  i hear about this place all the time and im not sure why     the ambiance is that of an old dive bar  which i dont mind  but nothing special  i felt the service was pretty good  although people were slightly confused by who had what bar tab  the drinks were good  but the selection of draft beers was small   oh my  now the food     it was not impressive  my chicken tasted like it was cooked while still frozen  the chicken had no flavor and an undesirable texture of a rubber tire  we tried the scallops as well  and they were yummy  but nothing special  the enchiladas were decent  but again  not anything special  overall not an experience i would want to have again  and let me just add that walking through the kitchen to use the bathroom is just not appetizing to me   
i try to go to lux as often as possible but i still have mixed feelings about it    the cappuccino is wonderful  one of my favorites  i cant say that enough  i recommend making a trip to try one if you havent  the food is always tasty and unique  if you can find a good place to sit i would try ordering one of the items on their menu  really fantastic  all of the pastries i have tried have been delicious also  i am telling you  you need to go   the only reason lux gets a 4 instead of 5 is because of the atmosphere  when i go its hit or miss  most of the time i get the impression they are way too hipster   bordering pretentious   to care about your experience  the following are just a couple examples   i wanted to try a drink at their full bar one night  so i asked one of the employees behind the bar what he had in his hand and he responded with  ice   yes  there was a piece of ice held in a pair of tongs in one hand  but he also had a cocktail in the other hand    following his response  he walked away from me and never returned to ask if i had any interest in ordering a drink or to give me any clue about what hed been making  most restaurants and employees attempt to make you feel involved and entice you to purchase something  but no such luck  unfortunately that experience was followed by another unpleasant one at the bar on a different night  so i havent felt inclined to drink there again    i had another recent experience with lux when i ordered a quiche from the front  we waited 10 minutes for them to heat it up but it was never called  so we checked and they said  oh  it must still be in the oven    although  didnt bother checking on the item or why this was taking so long to heat  since its already cooked   after another 10 minutes we checked with the front again and she finally went to check and said   oh  i guess its been in the oven the whole time   needless to say it was overdone  the staff didnt apologize or offer a replacement  sadly this didnt impress my friend who hadnt been to lux   i still say you should go  the food and espresso are amazing  i just wish they would come back down to earth a little bit 
i would give this a 3 5 if possible but not so 3 it is    ive been here multiple times and its not the food that keeps me coming back    its the mimosas  drinking aside  the food is okay and the service is fair at best    the staff is always pleasant  but during half of my visits here  ive had to sit around and wait for over an hour after ordering food    i have tried the benedict which was flavorless and cold  but its quite possible it sat around for many minutes before making it to my table  the steak and eggs were ok  but the eggs were not cooked properly and this was after waiting over an hour for food  i have also had the beef beast  which was actually very tasty and i did like the breakfast nachos  as well   the coffee is extremely watery and was disappointing  i have also tried a latte here  but it didnt taste right  i cannot be sure but it tasted like there was almond milk in it so i wouldnt try it again    i really want to love this place  but basically its a breakfast place i go to when i really just want to have a drink in the morning
ill start with the experience with the hostess  she seemed very confused and unclear of why we were there    the waiter was nice enough  but the service was not up to what i would expect at a steakhouse    the filet was subpar  very salty  but edible  the sides were nothing exceptional    at the end of our meal we were having some cocktails but the wait staff seemed frustrated that we werent rushing to leave  even though they were open for another 45 50 minutes    i wouldnt make a trip back 
i have tried everything on the menu and pulled pork sandwich is piled high and very tasty 
opened a business checking account  humberto yee flores  jr has taken great care of me   deposited a check on friday where they were going to hold the funds for 3 days    humberto call the issuing bank and verified funds to have the proceeds released immediately   love these guys 
so glad i yelped this place  i would have never came in on my own  outside looks like a hole in the wall that might not even be open  once you walk in whole different story  my new spot  i ordered the cauliflower as appetizer  salmon and peppered steak  dont know exact name but they were great  service was good too 
its not that the sandwiches are particularly unusual or unique  but they are nicely sized with good ingredients on quality bread   the patio is great this time of year and set back enough from camelback so that you can actually have a peaceful retreat   it can get busy at lunch  so i sometimes call my order ahead and it saves me time upon arrival 
pro  funky atmosphere great smell of bread wafting through the air yummy mozarella  basil  tomato sandwich owner on site  keeping tabs and schmoozing  con  limited choices  4 sandwiches  limited drink options pricy sandwiches
you know the saying   you get what you pay for   my experience at lake house cafe was exactly that  after purchasing a  20 dinner for two groupon for  12  my boyfriend and i decided to check the place out  living right down the street in one of the high rise condos  the location was super convenient  however when we walked in at about 6pm on a wednesday evening  we immediately felt the weirdest vibe  there appeared to be one woman working in the entire restaurant  hostess waitress busser cook cashier  although the restaurant was full  not a single table had food on it  and most drinks were empty  i actually saw a woman get up and go up to the station with the fountain drinks and get her own refill  unless that is how this place works normally     we stood around for about 10 minutes  without being acknowledged at all  and eventually decided the wait  which was obviously ridiculous  was not worth the  12  maybe someone called off  maybe someone quit  i dont know  but first impressions are key and its unlikely ill be back any time soon 
i have been a huge fan of color by numbers salon since 2007  when i was recommended by a friend from high school  the owner  natalie  who also cuts and colors my hair  is just plain awesome  she is very friendly  easy to chat with  and does an amazing job  every single time i have walked out of the salon  i feel elated with my new style  in particular  she is a great colorist and does the most incredible job with blonde  and did i mention the scalp massage during the shampoo  ive also gone back for a wedding updo and was thrilled because most places will give you the dreaded  prom hair   i walked out with a chic  messy side bun and to this day  it is one of my favorite looks ive ever had    other little details that make going to color by numbers a great experience  they will offer you tea  coffee  bottled water  etc   updated magazines on the coffee table  an array of bumble   bumble products for sale  comfy couches to lounge on while you are waiting for your color to set  and great ambient music  the pricing is also pretty reasonable  in my opinion  for a partial highlight  cut and style  i usually pay about  100  110  and this has only gone up maybe  5 or  10 in the last eight years 
great  low key barber shop  paul understands my difficult head of hair and offers sage advice as well 
i wish i would have read andreas review before coming to chile addiction  we had the chicken nachos and the chile rellenos with both green and red chile  to sum the food up in one word  bland  seriously  i didnt know a chile stuffed with cheese and covered in chile could be bland  but it was  calabicitas  bland  nachos  chips with plain chicken breast on top and a small amount of cheese sauce on the bottom  which somehow also lacked flavor   they dont even offer some table salsa to spice things up on your own   sopapillas come with your meal  which is a nice touch and why they got the 3rd star  however  we had 2 adults and 2 kids  so we split 2 entrees  and were served 2 sopapillas  how much would it cost to provide 4 sopapillas for 4 people    service was a little slow  but overall ok  mostly  im just disappointed that i used up one of my valuable bookmark trips on chile addiction 
been to publicus for brunch and for an afternoon snack  and overall i love it  the staff goes above and beyond to be friendly and helpful  and the vibe inside is pretty hip  theyve got that industrial rustic thing going which is so hot right now  its pretty casual  order at the counter and they bring the food out to you  we sampled a ton of their brunch offerings and all were really great  i think the vegetables on all the dishes stood out to me  i also enjoyed their selection of coffees and teas and tried the ginger london fog  on the baristas recommendation  very good and unique  where they fell short  surprisingly  was the pastries  we had the brookie  brownie cookie  and the chocolate chip cookie  they werent nasty or anything  but they just werent great  if in my neighborhood  id be a regular here  ill definitely be back to order lunch and give the pastries a second chance 
the good  the atmosphere and decor are cool   typical vegas lounge style  they have a patio  music is usually cool  bartenders are friendly  if youre there early  come on  people  i have a baby at home    theres no cover and no line  if youre there later  they do open bar for well drinks  you might see somebody getting an extremely overpriced tattoo  which is kinda cool to watch   the bad  this is really just a cool little lounge attached to a tattoo parlor  but for some reason  they are trying to make it into a club   the unknown  ive never gotten a tattoo there  so i cant comment on their workmanship or prices  but some of the people ive seen coming out have some cool looking tats 
durants is classic phoenix and i am a fan of classic phoenix   i love that its been there forever  since 1950  to be exact    i love that you enter through the kitchen  if you know whats up   i love the steaks  the martinis  the manhattan clam chowder  and the oysters  i love the service by a waitstaff that has worked there for 20  years   they are on top of your order  attentive not obtrusive  and very knowledgeable about the menu  i love the old time decor   feeling   dark wood and red banquettes   i do not love the high prices  but i am not surprised by them  however  if you order smartly  you can easily keep your meal under  40   open note to durants management  can you please get some new booths in there    the existing ones are old and saggy    
quick update  ive been going to trufusion  4 times a week for the last month or so  and have really enjoyed it  ive been to bootcamp  boxing bootcamp  trx  kettlebells  battleropes  yin  their proprietary flow class  level 1 and 2   the flow  vinyasa class  barre  and pilates  i have enjoyed them all  and especially enjoyed the varying opportunities  i have had low level back issues  muscular  i think  since i was a college athlete  and somehow aggravated it about a week ago  i was getting sharp shooting pain through my lower back and hips if i stood  turned  sat the wrong way  went to a couple yin classes and my problem is almost solved  again  shout out to trufusion for the amazing schedule  where i can get literally any class i want multiple times in the week  even if i have to wait for the kids to be in bed  also  im a convert on the heated classes  i really could feel it relaxing my back and allowing me to participate in the stretching  and if the heat causes my heart rate to be higher  maybe i am burning more calories  
really really  good food  service is great everyone is super friendly   vanessa is very sweet and nice 
really love the food at this place  i try and hit this spot once or twice a month    heres a few things people need to understand   1  food can sometimes be slow never has it came out wrong   2  food comes out at weird times  since different things take shorter or longer to cook rarely does it all come out at the same time  so for people who complain about this go to angry crab or their other locations  its part of the deal    3  the reason for the 4 stars  service is a crap shoot and its not like i demand a lot  usually when i go  i ask for maddie and things are awesome  most of the rest of the staff is forgettable  i truly miss some of their staff from when they first opened  but thankfully maddie is there and know how to rock things    
pretty typical diner food with a greek twist  i got some sort of greek platter and my bf got the gyro platter  you definitely get a ton of food for what you pay for  my  10 meal included a salad and soup and the huge meal itself   the decor is not particularly remarkable but the service was great  we used a groupon to visit and we will most definitely be back 
crazy good italian food just a stones throw from ohio city  the portions are huge and the food is delicious  i didnt dine in but got carry out  the service was prompt and courteous  love my lasagna and will be back soon   
so this may be my fave new place in gordon square  delicious drinks that we tried include 1  soda bird which included rum and pineapples  2  orange blossom soda  3  boozy hot cocoa and 4  ginger beer  all were great  bc of our yelp check in  we got free pretzel bites too   the vibe is cool  interior is cozy  there are several board games around too  service was good 
this isnt just a great place to get a good cup of coffee  its got ample parking and is a good place for meetings or to work solo 
the selection is pretty good and 75 percent of the prices are reasonable  i found a dress that would have cost  50  dollars for  14 
best middle eastern food in cle  i love the simple things like hummus and pita and more complex items like spinach pies and shawarmas  sooo good 
seriously   i love their daily specials that im willing to drive 20 minutes to westlake for this stuff  happy hour specials are great  tuesday small plate special  3 for  12   pollo ross is amazing  wednesday is pizza night  and the calamari is some of the best around  if youre getting a soup  spicy sausage lentil is amazing 
it looks and smells like pizza  but tastes like disappointment  my lover and i needed a sobering meal one night  we waited a long time and thats to be expected at a 24 hour pizza place  it was like  12 for a medium sized mushroom pizza  after we ate it we felt a little ripped off  the whole pizza was flavorless  mushrooms are supposed to be savory  a pizza sauce is supposed to be something  sweet  bitter  herby  anything  i left a cardboard crust graveyard in the box which i never do  i asked for ranch to choke it down  but it was the gross prepackaged variety  the upside is that the gentleman at the counter was very nice    also  anyone thats not familiar with this shopping center should know that its full of weirdoes and homeless 
very nice staff  great for dishes  kitchen items  sanrio products  and japanese snacks  it is truly inexpensive  come here to buy a cute gift for your friends  my brother and i used to come here for our snack attacks  i recommend the re ment mystery boxes  they are near the front and make cute unique gifts  warning about the parking lot  the middle is unmarked and people drive arbitrarily through it without caution 
great food  cool beer selection  but i hate the live music  they do it all the time  its ruined this place for me  also  weird people hang out here and the worst part is that they talk to you  if you are lucky to come here on a quiet empty day savor it  even when there is no band someone is bound to play awful music here  but the food is so good  get the nachos with everything  come here for lunch 
used to walk to 7 eleven as a kid to buy my lemon heads  boston beans  bubblegum and all the other junk food   now i walk to maverick for my coffee and its great selection of strengths   flavored  creamers  the staff is super friendly and this place has a well rounded with a unique selection for all tastes   my niece from ca loves those shakes   i agree theyre delicious but at my age  not worth 800 calories    my kids are following in my footsteps   boston beans  hi chew  bubble tape and other junk food   somethings  i hate to say  knowing what i do about sugar  never change   
great place for family fun   we celebrated my twins birthday part here   the staff were good for as young as they were   i focused on playing  celebrating and smile making and the outcome was fabulous 
breakfast rocks here   my two boys ordered the corn beef hash and eggs  my daughter and i split the pork chile verde omelette and it was delicious  my partner got the chicken fried steak  said it was  just ok     i will be back again for breakfast   bottom line  friendly and relatively fast service  tasty food  and a variety of choices 
i was very happy with my experience at jones tack   feed  jacob went above and beyond offering assistance and feedback to my familys questions regarding chicks  when it was time to purchase the chicks and supplies  vinnie was helpful with my final questions and concerns and he carried everything out to the car   the cashiers were pleasant and courteous 
we stopped going to garcias for a long time after a few bad experiences  we had raw chicken once  wrong orders once  etc  so after close to a year  my daughter talked me into giving them a try again since they were once a favorite  well    they are back  it was really good again  i love that they bring out bean dip and salsa  i dont like beans but it is a nice touch  the pollo fundido was amazing like it used to be  great rice  great salsa  great service  they have coupons regularly in the paper as well  the manager was going around asking everyone how their service and food was which i always appreciate  we will be back and soon  glad they have hopefully fixed the problems they were having 
love  love  love this store  i could spend every last dime i have in here organizing everything in my house  this store has stuff i would have never even thought of  it is such a fun store for people who love containers  organizing  or just unique items  i have completly reorganized my linen closet with stuff bought from here and it is fantastic  they are very friendly and helpful as well  prices are ok  a little high but the stuff is really good quality 
awful   its like eating in a retirement home   there is nothing hip  trendy or inviting   the lobster  shrimp  crab bisque was cold and had zero lobster  shrimp  crab actually in it   the chicken was still completely raw inside   the lasagna was cold   this was after waiting 45 minutes for our food  the owner was kind  tried to fix it  but it was just too far gone   the whole mess made us 30 minutes late for a commitment  the service was very  very slow  4 other restaurants have failed in this spot  i dont understand why people keep setting themselves up for failure 
love this place    opa    the food is fresh  staff is always courteous and friendly  try the gyros sandwich   yum 
we just had burgers  the meat was great and cooked perfectly  service was friendly but quite slow 
i did not go to t t  but i did go to chonga  their frozen drinks bar and got a decent plastic souvenir cup for about  17  the bartender was sweet  however  my group and i returned to get a refill of our drinks for  4 50 and    yeah  they were closed  at 11 04 pm 
its green   i love green parks   one of my best friends lives near here and i took full advantage of this park when i visit   its great for walking the dogs and theres a trail that takes you out into the neighborhood where you run into some large statues of a turtle  a hare  and a lion     the field caters to baseball and soccer  and you often see leagues playing here   theres also amphitheatre style seating  so you can just take in a relaxed day at the park   if i lived closer  i would be here more often 
dr  rose is awesome     and if i still lived on this side of town  my furball would still be coming to see dr  rose   she has a great bedside  kennel side   manner with the dogs  and she gave off this vibe of tranquility when relaying news about my furballs health   dr  rose has been the only vet that my dog has actually been excited to see  so kudos to her for being some sort of dog whisperer     the staff  from reception to vet techs  were also very pleasant   reception held down the fort and had things running smoothly  even on super early saturday mornings when the doors were first opening     again  if i lived over on this side of town  my dog would be seeing dr  rose at green valley animal hospital 
kudos to christina in the appliances department   so the story behind this kmart visit at the ends of the world  i rarely head to this side of town  was because i was doing a favor for a friend to pick up a deep freezer  i have an suv  said friend has a tiny sedan    we visit another kmart that incorrently stated they had the appliance in stock and when this other kmart failed  i contacted this kmart     i was transferred to christina in the appliances department  got confirmation that the deep freezer my friend was looking for was in stock and available  had it held  and then drove across the world to pick it up     we show up  walk to the appliances dept  find christina  pull the deep freezer all sorts of brand spanking new in the box  no floor model crap   do the transaction  with a surprise discount  awesome   and get it rolled out to the front and put into the back of my suv     the entire visit at this kmart took all of 15minutes  if that   awesome   im not a big fan of kmart in general and i wont be coming back for my regular shopping  but this was a great shopping experience 
i have been to hwaro many times i have got to say this place is superb   great service overly tasty food   if your looking to try a new place or have a date night planned give this restaurant a try i promise you wont regret it   
my second time going to darren kwik and i am writing this review because when i looked them up  i couldnt believe they only had 2 reviews so far  to start  everyone is extremely nice and accommodating  darren is an awesome stylist  as i have seen his customers walk out the door with amazing  style  ashleigh   who couldnt be nicer  does my hair and right from the start  she knew exactly what kind of hair i have   dry and frizzy  and tailored the cut to work with my hair type as well as taught me how to do it at home on my own  i am 40 years old  and its the best hair style i have ever had   lastly  it is totally affordable    these guys love what they do   and it shows 
 10 whack ass burritos no thanks   theyre meat is dry old refried beans ill pass  
this was a very solid place  but didnt blow me away   it gets a lot of foot traffic  right off the lobby and near the garden area   so  the line is likely to be long   but  dont worry  the staff is very good at moving it along   i started out of the store and it didnt take long at all to get through  maybe 10 minutes or so   i was there around 10 in the morning  so more of a brunch time than breakfast or lunch   i had a piece of quiche lorraine   this was a good sized piece for about  8   and  it arrives to you quickly after ordering   ill say  they need to work on the heating method   the edges were quite hot  but the middle was near cold   not all the way  but certainly cool   the quiche was very good  great flaky crust and good cheese flavor   the outside had a nice crispness to it   this place  as many note  is filled with sweets   they looked fantastic   the prices are decent for the strip  particularly since its at bellagio   worth stopping if you need a quick sandwich or snack 
this is  amazingly  only a review for the lunch special  or the ale and sandwich bar   i cant believe i havent been here for dinner yet  but ill get there   the lunch is beyond solid  probably the best deal when considering quality  amount of food  and cost i have found in the valley   each day  they have a special   prime rib sandwich  turkey sandwich  soup and sandwich  etc   also  you can simply get the prime rib sandwich   this entitles you to go to the fixings bar  where they have a few sauces  pickles  onions  potato salad  and pasta salad at the very least   on some days  the bar is more substantial than other days   when you return to your table  you find homemade potato chips waiting  of course with lawrys seasoning salt for flavor   its a fantastic  and quick lunch service   you sit down  give your drink order  then go to the bar and order   less than 5 minutes later  you are back seated and eating   great for those working and dont have time for a super long lunch  but dont want fast food   the most expensive sandwich is the prime rib at  16   thats still a fantastic deal for the amount of food you get  and its lawrys quality  carved right off the bone   you can get full plates as well of either prime rib or turkey with all of the sides   but  given how much food you get with the sandwich specials  ive never had to   if you are in the area  or even if you arent  its a fantastic lunch   11 30   2 00 
we stayed at wynn while we had some friends from college in town for a wedding   the rooms  as may yelpers note  are fantastic   large  and ours was clean   the bed was very comfortable  it wasnt too soft  which is something i usually find at hotels   the lights and shade are operated by wall panels that are very easy to operate   every time we needed something  be it room service  the bell desk  linens  they arrived very quickly   i also got a late checkout with no issues  so that was appreciated   wynn is beautiful  its clear the details were important while the property was being built and designed   that being said  stuff isnt cheap   from drinks to the gaming tables  its pricey   there are some good restaurants  la cave was a favorite of ours before we stayed here   even though everything was great  i had to subtract a star because the air conditioning in our room was not consistent   it was very difficult to get the room cool  even when it was on 68 and high fan   so  that was frustrating   but  overall  very friendly staff and great service   just dont get sticker shock 
this is really a 2 5 star review  but not 3   i went around 8 am on a thursday   so  prime time for people on their way to work   it was pretty crowded  and they only had 2 employees working   as a result  orders took awhile   i dont blame the guys working  they were doing the best they could   but  the management should make sure they have help at peak times   i had the spicy bagel  i cant recall its name   i think its the tijuana   but  the cream cheese was not as spicy as advertised  nor was the jalapeno cheddar bagel   also  it was not toasted  which i did ask for   but  i chalk this up to how busy the crew was   i had the breakfast potatoes  which were done with diced onions and no discernible seasoning   they required a lot of salt  pepper  and hot sauce to give them flavor   also  a few of the potatoes were not completely cooked  and crunchy when bitten   i think this dish has potential  but execution was way off   all in all  i would probably return if im in the area  but i wont make a special trip   i would like to try lunch  so i imagine well do that at some point 
i had eaten several times at m m before i started yelping   i only realized today that i had never reviewed m m   the last time we ate here  i had the fried chicken with mac n cheese  dressing and okra   the wife had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes  green beans and mac n cheese   one of the things i love about m m is that you get 3 sides with the full meals   of course  we had the crispy  sweet  thin cornbread pancakes   these are great with some butter and honey     the chicken  as many yelpers note  is fantastic   a textbook crispy crust reveals juicy chicken throughout   they make it fresh  so it comes out hot   all of the sides are great  but the okra really stands out to me   maybe thats because whenever i find okra out in vegas i get excited  but there is more to this okra   the breading is seasoned  i dont know what with  but it adds something that other fried okra in town lacks    the wifes meatloaf was covered in a flavorful brown gravy   this was a moist meatloaf  not as dense as other meatloaves   excellent seasoning and veggies used in the meatloaf     i dont think you can go wrong here   excellent food served by friendly people   give it a shot 
this is a solid poker room that exhibits a lot of the problems poker rooms have when casinos dont invest in them   to start  this is just an area off of the casino floor   this allows excess noise  and at times  smoke  to encroach on the room   if you are looking to drink and have fun  this is a good room for that   i dont like to drink while i play generally  so thats why its not one of my favorites   the dealers are technically proficient and generally very friendly   they make it fun for you   this room is not entirely tourists  but the percentage of locals in my experience is not as high as it is in other rooms   you can get nlhe just about any time of the day 
ive had several good washes at moonlight   i came to this location when it was owned and managed by another group prior to moonlight   i love the physical building  they have televisions inside  comfortable couches and chairs  and clean bathrooms   there is the usual choices of sodas  snacks and the like   also  they are good about giving you free reign on the remote  more than once ive changed the channel while i am waiting     in addition  and this is a nice bonus  mountainside is right next door   i will usually drop my car off and go have breakfast or lunch at mountainside   so  i usually dont wait  just get a bite to eat and its time to leave   the washes arent cheap  but they are thorough and of good quality   also  the prices are largely in line with what ive seen from other places in the valley   additionally  and this is important  they last   my cars have stayed looking clean even after a few days in the dessert wind and  or heat   weve had them get out a couple of minor scratches as well  and this always goes well   if you live near moonlight  give it a shot 
very solid burger and fry joint   as some yelpers have noted  each table has its own fry sauce  ranch bottles   its a small touch  but its nice   i found the sauces to be a little thinner  but not watery   ive not had issues with the cleanliness or appearance of the restaurant like other yelpers have   all in all  you can get a very solid  and large  burger for a good price   its a repeat  and its why its been in boulder for so long 
we eat here at least once a week  the owners  staff are always so friendly and they go out of their way to make sure their customers are satisfied  we generally always order the same thing every time   drunken noodles with chicken  basil fries rice and the panang  although weve had thai food other places that were better  this place is always consistent and very very good 
i used to get takeaways from this chinese a lot when i lived over the road from it  that was a few years ago  now i have moved back down leith way  we decided to get a takeaway from here to try it out again   the food is decent and pretty cheap  delivery is free and pretty quick  the peices of meat in the dishes are usually quite large and the menu is pretty varied   i used to usually order the sweet   sour chicken cantonese style  a classic  and its great  really tasty  huge portions too so you can have it for lunch the next day  this week i ordered the satay chicken  it was really tasty but not really what i expected  the sauce was tasty but very spicy and i couldnt really see any peanuts in it   overall  a great chinese  great delivery  tasty food  cheap prices  huge menu and huge portions 
the word of the day for this visit was slow    id never eaten here before  but joe a  bought a voucher for burgers and cocktails so we visited on wednesday before going to the cinema at 8pm  table was booked for 6 30pm so we had plenty of time    we thought    it was pretty quiet but even so they did seem a bit under staffed  we ordered our cocktails and they took quite a while to arrive  but were very nice so all could be forgiven  we also ordered our burgers and i went for the mushroom veggie option    we finished our cocktails and patiently waited for our food  as we saw other tables get their food  eat it and leave  an hour and a half passed and all we had had was one little cocktail  finally a waitress  who looked like she might have been a supervisor  manager  came and asked what we had ordered  after she went away to investigate  she came back and apologised that when our order was made  the till roll ran out and so it wasnt received by the kitchen  she was very apologetic and i understand this was just unlucky  as a result she offered us both another complimentary cocktail  however  she never reappeared to take our drinks order so joe went and ordered for us    our food turned up and it was nice but my chips were a bit under cooked and raw in the middle  but by this point i was so hungry and didnt say anything  our new drinks also took their time and didnt make an appearance until joe had finished his food   as a result of all this we had to go to a later showing of the film and i fell asleep     when we left  the same waitress again apologised  she was lovely and handled it really well  i would go back there  but just make sure i have plenty of time  and maybe order my next drink as soon as i receive my first one  as for the food order  that was an honest mistake  hence why ive given them three stars and not fewer 
over the past few weeks joe a  and i had been working our way through the cocktail menu here  with great success   the bar staff are a bit hit and miss  but generally quite nice    the atmosphere is very quirky and chilled out  it is a great date venue or somewhere to just chill out with good quality drinks    im not even going to say which cocktails i like best   i like them all  you should try them all    go  go now  it might even be my favourite cocktail bar in edinburgh 
today was my first visit to sushi bomb for lunch  i ordered ayce at the lunch special price of  20 95   6 savings from the dinner price     i definitely treated myself and ordered a ton of food  i had to start with edamame  shrimp tempura  and miso soup   i ordered about 4 rolls too  but my favorite was the monster roll  the flavors were perfect    the service is decent  and the staff is usually always friendly    for dessert  i prefer the fried green tea ive cream or plain green tea  so delicious    ill definitely be back 
always flavorful and delicious  tons of flavors to choose from  and theyre always adding seasonal tastes as well   perfect family dessert or treat stop  always a lot of people no matter what time of year  it really gives a great energy to the place  and it makes you excited to go there for your treat    my personal favorite flavors would be anything tropical or fruit flavored  i like to mix vanilla or plain flavor  then ill add mochi and white chocolate chips for extra fun flavor  my mouth is watering now 
ive been having maribeth do my tattoo work  2 full sleeves  for almost 2 years now  and i am so happy with her   i really enjoy her friendly attitude since there seem to be so many macho personalities in tattoo shops   and on top of that  she can do some rad tattoos     one sleeve that she took on as a rework went to a whole new level   the colors are so awesome  and make the whole piece really come together   right now  i think we are over halfway done with that arm  but i already wanted maribeth to start on my other sleeve   we worked together on a really cool  ocean  design   elbow and below is underwater with an octopus  turtles  etc   and above the elbow is a super rad mermaid scene   im so excited to continue having her do my work     next up  full chest tattoo 
its always time for a cherry limeade  this location has been great for me so far  i mostly visit for the drink specials and treats  but i will enjoy the good fast food sometimes  too      favorite snack  route 44 cherry limeade and jalepeno poppers 
this is unique  fun  and a great way to be a kid again  it is a little pricey but i thought it was worth it and would do it again  the video is educational and really makes you appreciate what it takes in nature for all these amazing species to survive  the room with the cocoons is really neat and you actually see some emerging at times  the actual butterfly pavilion is amazing  so many beautiful butterflies and they land right on you and it is peaceful and amazing  then they have a small exhibit with bees and ants and scorpions etc  they do try to sell you a picture but ours came out really great so we got it as a fun souvenir  i would go back maybe once every six months as something fun and different to do 
my daughter brought me here after having attended a yelp event  i had the lobster roll and added the fries  the bread on the lobster roll is the best  it is just like you get back east and was perfectly toasted  the whole sandwhich was really great and the salad that comes with it had just the right amount of balsamic  the brown sugar butter sauce that comes with the fries is really tasty  i also had the lemon bar and fruit for dessert  it had lots of great flavor without being overpowering    what really stood out was our server  allard was so helpful and nice  he brought us a dinner menu since i wanted to come back and try more and aswered all the questions i had about what was on it  he really took time to help us and kept our drinks full and was very sweet  i cant wait to go back and try more  it was all so good 
i really love pita jungle and this is really convienent right inside the mall  they have great salads and sandwiches as well as hummus  i have tried several things now and i havent had a bad item yet  while the chandler  gilbert location is 5 stars  this one the service just isnt what it is at the other location  the person taking orders this past saturday just wasnt pleasant at all  the food is just as good as the regular restaurants though    my favorite item here is the chicken philly pita  while it isnt the healthiest thing on the menu it is very tasty  it is worth the extra calories  this is probably the best meal you can get at the food court in a mall 
i had really great customer service here  i had a wallflower plug in that stopped working after 3 months and they exchanged it and were really great about it  there are always great sales and coupons and good deals on all the products  i mostly use their hand soap and their wallflower plug ins  these are good products at decent prices and the people are usually very helpful  if they are out of a certain fragrance on the shelves they are always really good about going in the back and checking for more for you as well 
i had terrible customer service at this location yesterday  my daughter wanted to by a bra that had a sign with a picture of the same bra and it said  29 99  when we went to pay the bra rang up twice the price and when we showed the sign to the clerk she took it down and said it should have been taken down a while ago and that we couldnt have that price  she then tried to say it wasnt for that bra even though it is the exact one in the picture  she said the description is for a different one that isnt the picture  that didnt even make sense  we left with nothing after being told we had to pay a different price then was clearly advertised 
i am a big fan of rubios  my favorite is their gourmet shrimp tacos  there are a couple coupons throughout the year which is always a nice touch  while they are usually clean  this one didnt have anyone wiping tables and it wasnt busy but they are usually good   i love that they have 4 different types of salsa for you to try  i got a coupon for chips and guacamole which now made me hooked on the guac  fast service and good food    another good choice if you are watching calories is their health mex burrito  i do add some balsamic dressing to it and it is really good for a healthier option 
pina colada tea  need i say more   seriously though  really great selection of unique teas  great service  they send email specials periodically and they have your order ready for you to pick up quickly or you can have it mailed  i like going in to the store though  it is bright and well organized and clean  prices are really reasonable compared to some of the competitors 
the concept is amazing  and i probably set my hopes too high for this little joint  watching a movie and enjoying full service food and drink at the push of a button  whats not to love   turns out  just about everything  the execution was totally off  we were the only people in the theater but somehow the service still sucked  the food was mediocre  the second run movies were mediocre  but plenty entertaining after a couple glasses of wine  which were offered at a decent price   i guess its the cheap bastard gene in me that has a problem with this place  i nearly bust a nut when i have to pay full price at a regular theater and shell out for their snacks  let alone drop double the amount on a crappier second run version of the same theater fare    ill stick to catching the drive in double feature with my own bottle o wine and snacks  rather than return to this place and shell out obscene amounts of money on freezer burned puff pastry and vino 
let me start off my saying  this is the best curry in las vegas  ive been to other places in vegas and they are more popular but they are a lot more expensive and offer you less food  after finding out about oh curry i fell in love  i am always catching myself eat here  the owner is very nice and courteous  he always checks up to make sure your meal is good  i get the chicken cutlet hot and a side a fries with a calpico  so good and still budget friendly  definitely my favorite japanese curry place in las vegas  visit hide and give it a try  it wont be your last time in  the curry is addicting 
very disappointing  i think well stick to the cranberry location  the ambience is all wrong  its extremely bright  there are even lamps on the tables and we were glad we could shut that off  the music is awful  modern bubblegum pop   music from trolls despicable me etc     something about the staff even seemed off for an authentic mexican restaurant   the food was just as good as the other locations although our chorizo queso was very runny 
not a fan   the pho broth was decent  but  when were ordering a pho tai  with rare beef  were kind of expecting rare beef  not rare beef that has been precooked in the soup and then served  plus more beef please  the prices are higher than most places downtown  also if the server could not play their music videos on their speaker phones while were dining  that would be appreciated  you know that feeling when someone wants to show you a youtube video  no on wants to hear other peoples junk on speaker phone while they are trying dine  just stop or do it in your own privacy 
ive never really tried muay thai before  and when i did i really enjoyed it  but    on my first class i wasnt aware that i had to purchase my own gloves    which is fair enough  but i really wished the sales rep told me this before i signed up  the classes i went to were fun and they make you work  facilities were clean with hair  body products available  and overall the community felt very welcoming  even with noobs like myself   4 stars for that for that   unfortunately i felt my sales rep person was very unhelpful  on the website they state that you would get some goodies such a tshirt and video of some sort  i never got that  i would leave a few messages regarding if it was safe for me to train with an unplanned injury and i had other queries that were left unanswered    2 stars   i encourage people to try new things  but just be weary on what youre signing up for and maybe take a photo of your contract on your smartphone 
really a wonderful way to take a trip to grand canyon if you are in the phoenix area and dont have a lot of time   lindsay in the office answered all of our goofy pre trip questions    we were picked up from the hotel   we took a 90 minute flight up to the west rim of the canyon  we helicoptered down into then canyon to do a short jaunt on the colorado river   a bus takes you to the skywalk and a some scenic overlooks   the pilot ryan was with us the entire day and was great with our kids   unforgettable views and we were back poolside before dinner 
my girlfriend and i checked in today for an anniversary  valentines day staycation  they let us check in early and after a little mix up we were able to get our preferred second floor pool view balcony room  we had an awesome day at the pool  they knew we were celebrating our anniversary and brought us a complimentary bottle of champagne which was delicious   if you ask for something  you will get it here at the scott  my only recommendation for management is that you have more than one guy running the pool  restaurant and bar orders  otherwise we are very pleased with our stay thus far 
about 2 rows of stores   i guess its a good start   however  there were only a couple of places to eat and if im not mistaken  a chines place and a pretzel place   no food court   thats a big bummer     its one of those covered out doors outlet   very nice for this time of year but itll still be pretty dang hot in the summer  even with misters  which im assuming they  have   there is an h m which is cool but i didnt stop by there     waaay to many people  ill spend more time there after the christmas crowd dies off a bit 
this one has a coffee shop right next door and attached   the gelato was yum   not too many places to sit but there is also outdoor seating   the kids loved a treat 
our experience was totally different  if i rated on just the food  i would give it 3 stars  however  the service was terrible   we come in  the waitress points to where we need to sit and she brings a high chair for us   she asks us what we want to drink  we said water and from then on she just acted like a total b   and i use this word quite sparingly so believe me when i was not happy at all with her attitude   we have a kid  we know its going to get messy so we are usually very kind to the wait staff so i know it wasnt us   we order 3 lunch specials and all three should come with soup   we only get two   i asked about the third and she just seemed totally unhappy i even mentioned it   i dont get it  especially since all the other reviews have been decent about their service   never got a refill on my water   i think the hubby did once   never asked how we were doing   they werent even busy   towards the end she seemed nicer but the first impression was already made   maybe she just finished with a crappy customer or something   ill give them a second shot   they are reasonably priced   we havent had a lunch under  20  before tip 
i like how you can pick what you want on your burger   good service  good food   would definitely come back again 
a little on the small side but a decent theatre   im just used to big open areas but this place felt crammed going in with the video games in the front entrance   i havent tried the d box seats yet but my friends say it is overrated   other than that  this place gets the job done  to get a movie watched 
we come here pretty frequently for breakfast   delicious goodness   if you get a meal that comes with a muffin  its a lot of food   enough to share   our favorite  chocolate mousse muffin   deeee lish 
meh  ive experienced better    the service was good   lady was cordial and greeted us so kudos to her for that   however  the yogurt itself was not that great and i have been to several froyo places   the froyo here tastes kind of icy  like its been there a while if you know what i mean   not the creamy ish kind that i like  and presume how froyo  shoud  taste like    anyway  if im ever in the area and have a hankering for froyo  i perhaps will try again bc service was decent but for the most part  id go to other froyo places that i enjoy more 
the food was good but the service was little to be desired   both the hubby and i ordered different rice noodle  not pho but the dry kind with fish sauce  with meat on top and the flavor i thought was pretty good   the menu items are also reasonably priced   the wait staff  however  could use a little sprucing up   our waiter just kind of plopped the plates on our table and left   no  enjoy your meal  or  how are things     it looks like its run by a  real  vietnamese family so you know that all that matters in places like this is that the food is good  which i cant complain about 
coffee is really good  service is terrible   the service isnt bad per say but they are either understaffed or the folks behind the counter arent trained very well dealing with customer traffic   ive been there when 5 or 6 people are in line and when theres only 1 or two ahead of me and either times   whether its 2 guys or 1 guy behind the counter   it takes forever to get my order   its like these guys cant work in a rhythm   with that said though  their coffee is pretty decent  especially their iced drinks   plus they have a good variety of drinks  including boba     looks like since they opened though theyve focused mainly on coffee and other beverages   they used to have some filipino treats which has dwindled in variety   you can find it here and there but not in abundance   right outside of macys in the mall 
this place probably doesnt compare to the  real deal  in taiwan but i took my mom here  who grew up in taiwan  and we both really liked it   we got the egg plant  tofu dish and that fatty meat with bamboo dish and we thought they were both pretty authentic   for their  small appetizers  we tried the scallion pancakes which was ok   the place is pretty small and we went the week of cny so of course it was super crowded   i dont know how busy they are during  regular  days   we really enjoyed the service and the food   would definitely go there again and try different stuff on the menu   prices were very reasonable  too 
nice place to peruse for books and dvds      they also have a musical instruments section 
we frequently come here   it is pretty well stocked   ive purchased things directly from the store and have done pick ups from internet orders as well     i give it three stars bc i didnt have a good experience with their customer service a few years ago after purchasing a laptop   im usually a pretty agreeable person so i know it wasnt on my end   plus  the staff helpfulness can be shotty   sometimes good  sometimes sub par but for the most part  weve had good experiences there 
this place was pretty good   the broth in my pho wasnt as tasty as i normally like it but it was still good   my daughter loved the pho noodles  the only thing she eats    service was pretty decent and i liked that they had tofu spring rolls even though the peanut sauce was just ok   we would definitely come back here again 
well  i wanted to try these  but the line was always around the block with soccer moms with strollers and kids  so i didnt   i pulled in the other day just cause there was no line  and i was passing by   i ordered the red velvet cupcake for me and my amigo   it came to  7 02 for the two   but  it was the most moist and delicious cupcake i have had   i wanted to buy enough for the next month  and just chow down for them and try to look like jabba the hut   i didnt   it was expensive   but  man oh man  that was one delicious cupcake 
wow  there seems to be some negativity about the bungalow lately   i have to say i have always had an excellent experience here  and this is one of my favorite restaurants in old town scottsdale   i love the happy hour specials and the bartenders make a dang good dirty martini  and the best cosmopolitan i have had   i love the kobe hamburger  and the strawberry salad and filet mignon steak salads are to die for   no matter what i have  ordered it has been great   i bring friends here all the time  and we always have a great time   be sure to ask for tawna   she is the best person there   dont hate   appreciate the bungalow 
i love this restaurant   the hummus with pine nuts and with chicken  or without  is to die for   i love hummus  and this is so good   i have also eaten their schwarma pits  fried garbonzo beans in a pita  which is equally delicious   yum   i have also had a small lunch pizza with spinach  pesto  goat cheese  and tomatos  yum  all in all this place has great food  and in have always had great service  and delicious food  it is very fun and consistent   i will always go back 
i have probably left my dogs here around 4 5 times and everytime i get them out of the car to go in they act like sled dogs pulling me in to the doors    this is usually a good sign that they are fans as well   cost effective compared to every other kennel i have called or experienced and the owners are very nice   helpful   also they have cameras set up so if you want to check on the website you can 
ate here twice while on vacation and loved it   i should mention that i have never really liked thai food  but this place was great   with each dish  they ask what level of spice you prefer and what type of meat   if youre sensitive to spicy foods  just choose no spice and youll still get a flavorful dish   we tried the pad see ew  with no spice   red curry  w   medium spice   curry noodles  w   mild spice   and drunken noodles  w   medium spice  all with chicken   highly recommend the curry dishes   theyre soupy  warm  flavorful  and just all around delicious  we will definitely return to thai basil on our next visit to phoenix 
was in phoenix on vacation and ended up eating here four times   twice for breakfast  a lunch  and one dinner  laid back atmosphere  everyone is super friendly  and was never too crowded  the frittata  devils mess  fried chicken  and rotisserie chicken were all outstanding  coming from washington  dc the prices were very reasonable  i hope to come here again  and again   highly recommend to friends and family 
craving a pasty  went down and got some brownies and eclairs for the family  absolutely awful   how do you mess up a brownie   they figured it out  eclair was overbaked and tasteless  so disappointed 
found them on yelp   were very close to where i live   very nice staff   fixed my wifes watch for a very reasonable price   much less than what the manufacturer wanted   they did a great job  was done in 3 days and would use again 
anthony is a wonderful hairstylist  my hair needed an upgrade and he got the job done  he asked me for what i wanted and i told him i wanted some depth  dimension and he nailed it with 3 different shades of blonde  definitely coming back
this is the second time i have used these guys  first time was pretty good but it took an additional trip and more hours than the estimate which was a few hundred dollars more out of my pocket   the second experience was a disaster  two very young   very inexperienced boys who were clearly just learning while charging the full price of professional movers   very friendly and hard working loaders with a good attitude  unfortunately way in over their head to  be considered professional movers    find a few teenagers and save yourself the disappointment of expecting a professional moving company   
before going downtown to throw some hard 8s   6s at the craps table  my buddy and i decided to get a quick meal so we didnt have to eat during our all night of gaming  we found this place and decided to check it out because it seemed to have asian patrons    we were quickly seated and ordered the chinese broccoli in oyster sauce   10  and the spicy ying nan rice noodles   14  and the service was very quick  the portions were decent and it wasnt as greasy compared to the true chinese restaurants back home  the spiciness on the soup was fair and the chinese broccoli was steamed just right where it still had a crunch    expensive  but what do you expect in the venetian  its an alternative when you crave decent chinese food on the strip late at night without driving to chinatown 
fantastic quality of food and beer  this is perhaps one of the best reasonably priced drinking establishments in phoenix 
great food  especially the brisket tacos   the menu isnt huge  but if youre in the mood for burgers or tacos mahalls is a good choice   the jerkey appetizer is great if you like the idea of deep fried beef strips   havent gone bowling there but will soon

unison uses frozen food reheated and charged an insane amount  just wanted to have a fun night on my birthday and ended up going to la cage across the street to have it  go for pool and beer but not the food and mediocre service 
the supreme pizza is packed with topping and very thin crust  terrific pizza and around  15 for a large  great combo
mixed reviews    we ordered a chicken bowl  shrimp diablo taco and cheesesteak taco  bad  the chicken bowl was pretty bland  not a lot of flavor and the chicken itself was dry  good  the shrimp diablo taco and the cheesesteak tacos were both very flavorful and packed full of meat  bad  while we were eating one of the tacos  my friend pulled a loooong hair out of her mouth that was in the taco meat  now  i know this is a new restaurant and stuff happens   but still   pretty disgusting  good  the management and workers were very accommodating and refunded our entire purchase as we had lost our appetite  i appreciate this because some other restaurants would not have done this  i dont think we will be back because we were haunted by the hair but overall the food itself was not terrible and the management took care of us 
great customer service and im usually in and out pretty quick with any appointments etc  the place does need a quick renovation as the tables and furniture is starting to look worse for the wear 
probably the best hand pulled noodles you can get in town   i usually order the xo sauce beef noodle stir fry  shaved noodles always shaved noodles    their pan fried dumplings and salt and pepper fish dish is also awesome   they do have a viewing window where you can see the incredible skilled chef pulling the noodles apart   lastly  i normally finish the meal with a boba milk tea  delicious    all in all  youre not going to be disappointed with this place 
ordered the thai tea and basic house pho while here  service was great and attentive and the pho was out of this world delicious  the noodles were cooked perfectly and there was a good assortment of tripe  and beef  the soup itself was hearty and filled with flavor  i did get a bit thirsty after eating the pho but thats to be expected as i believe they use msg   the thai tea was made well and had a good ratio of ice to tea  will come by again when im in town 
i had high hopes for this place given the great reviews  went with my wife and kids to try the black sesame milk tea with boba  at first i was honestly thinking it tasted ok and so did my wife  then the horrifying realization that something was off when i started tasting pieces of something in my mouth and started spitting it out  it ended up being pieces of plastic packaging  not just 1 piece but several  had i had my kids try some they might have been harmed  theyre 1 and 3   ill never go back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone else 
hello  i needed a little trim and i walk by this shop all the time when i go into safeway and i live real close  so i decided to give them a shot  so easy  the two ladies working were very friendly  tabitha cut my hair and did a great job and shared some awesome ideas on product  i usually get my hair cut somewhere else but i will use her again because the price was awesome and service was great  thank you ladies 
the burgers were good but not good enough to wait 90 mins for  imo go around the corner to 5 guys 
every one of my guests raved about how delicious the cake was at my wedding   we opted for a small round cake and cupcakes for the guests  with three different flavors to choose from   jay made toppers for the cake and cupcakes in the shape of succulent plants  which was a continuous plant theme in our wedding   they were delicious and beautiful   amazing  
i was in general under impressed by the aria  the cafe was eh  the bar was eh  our room was eh  towels were scratchy  the  black out  drapes let it so much light we woke up at 6am  the shower tub situation was so weird  the  rainfall  shower was just aggressive and sprayed everywhere  i wont stay here again 
im one of those asian kid who dont crave for bubble tea all the time  i mean  i do drink it but its just not my go to drink     however after having coco tea  i have been craving it for the past few weeks so this must mean something      my favorite drinks are 3 guys cuz its a drink with the best value  for around  5 you can get a mixture of tapioca  grass jelly and pudding  im cheap lol   i like the strong black tea flavor in the drink and the pudding is smooth and velvety  good grass jelly is hard to come by these days as most places just scoop out tasteless black jello now  im happy to say that the grass jelly here has a mellow herbal taste to it that i love   my other fav drink is the lemon king when i dont want milk tea as it is super refreshing  and they even put an entire lemon in the drink  i recommend getting it half sweet so you will be able to taste the slight sourness from the lemon 
 the price range of nam sandwich shop is obviously more expensive than the cheap nguyen huong banh mi in chinatown  seriously  you cant beat the price of  2 75 large banh mi in nguyen huong    there wont be cold cuts or those delicious unhealthy lard  pate on your sandwiches  at a reasonable price point  nam offers some traditional and fusion touches to your daily viet subs    lavong fish   namslaw   thai ice tea   i cant describe how much i love this banh mi  it reminds me of my childhood in vietnam  sobs      the fish nam used here was catfish marinated in turmeric  then stir fried in dills and fish sauce  and nams version of the dish was exactly what i had in ha noi  the turmeric give the fish an incredible pop of yellow color  stir fried with dill and it releases the most mouthwatering fragrance  its hard to describe the flavor of this sandwich unless you try it out yourself  the ingredients are incredibly simple  yet it definitely delivered a big punch of flavor   i will say some people might not like abundance of dills and the oiliness from the fish  but this is how this dish is supposed to be  i didnt try the namslaw as i was mesmerized with the catfish lol  but my friend seemed to like it  and she gave a big thumbs up to the thai ice tea as it was creamy and not too sweet    fried egg banh mi   yam fries   minty lemonade   the owner will ask how you would like the egg to be done and i say pick the gooey egg yolk than the more well done fried egg  the baguette was crunchy on the outside yet incredibly soft on the inside  the fried egg was lightly salted  together with the soft baguette and fresh toppings  the ingredients were flawlessly combined to create a harmonious flavor   the yam fries were your typical fries  however the curry mayonnaise sauce was the highlight here  the curry flavor in the sauce was light  not overpowering and surprisingly complimented the sweet potato fries very well  i could tell the lemonade was freshly made with no sugar or additives  it was refreshing and not overly sweet  exactly what i needed on a hot summer day 
3 5  5   i love the simplistic  all white and airy decor of this place  the patio and front seatings are more for individuals who love to enjoy their brunch and quick coffee break  whereas at the back there is a communal table  a chalkboard wall and a wall fill with book pages  very quite and comfortable  if you want to enjoy some nature and get away from the loud noises of the city  there is a private garden at the back with a hammock    fika only offer free wifi after 3pm and you have to ask the waitress for the password    friendly and efficient services    they keep the space very clean     fika iced coffee    4 40    initially i didnt like it  as the mint and cardamom were quite an odd pairing with coffee  but i grew to love the flavor  the drink itself was very aromatic from the cardamom and not too sweet  i didnt think the mint was needed as the cardamom already added a spicy and herbal kick to the coffee    scones   i cant remember what type of scone this was  as they have different choices for the day  i remember having another scone with a raspberry jam and they were just the average scones   on both occasions  the scones i got were cold  hard and very dense  however they werent too sweet and went well with a cup of coffee    lavender white hot chocolate    4 00  the lavender white hot chocolate was another specialty of fika  and it wasnt my favourite as i find lavender is too strong and artificial  also  white chocolate isnt chocolate lol  its pure sugar so this drink is very sweet 
i highly recommend bosworth customs  these guys are true experts and easy to work with  i was in desperate need of new tires  so chad was my first and only phone call  within an hour he had a set ordered and installed    chad is very knowledgeable  trusworthy and fair 
absolutely wonderful food  environment  people  etc   i have always enjoyed coming here to eat and their friendly staff makes it a visit worth while  the food is always great and the prices are excellent  i recommend this restaurant to anyone at anytime  you will not go wrong 
just got done last week with the sunfare optimal cleanse   the program was easy to follow and not as difficult as i expected    the food and shakes were enjoyable    i mixed the shakes in the blender with ice and water and a little stevia and cinnamon and they were satisfying    i lost exactly 10 lbs in the 10 days as claimed and i did not start out needing to lose any more than that   great program for those looking to drop the last 10 stubborn lbs or for those looking to get a quick jump start on a longer weight loss plan   thanks sunfare for offering this great program   i am now committed to remaining caffeine and gluten free thanks to your program 
the prices are on the high side but the pizza  knots and calzones ive had are definitely above average  i only give so few stars simply because the place constantly seems like its  crashing and burning    the staff are constantly in the weeds  in each others way  behind on orders and genuinely confused  it seems to be that way even at 3 4 pm  theres a lot of kids working there  so its understandable to a point  honestly they are all trying to be attentive and helpful    my experience has been okay for carry out  but with about 7 8 orders under my belt i have never been given an order that was correct or complete the first time  and always with a  youre all set   then me pointing out the missing or wrong item  then the staffer reading the ticket and realizing the mistake 
top notch service  helpful  friendly staff who werent used car salesmen  they actually looked for discounts  and price matched amazon for pillows and the adjustable base  ended getting another 10  off just for buying that day    the supervisor that day even suggested we wouldnt be as happy with a more expensive mattress  and that has never happened to me in any mattress or furniture store    we are very happy and despite moving will likely come back to this location when we need a bed 
came in with a party of 12 under a reservation  it took 50 minutes to place our order for food  after an hour seated we finally got our drink order  if you want a burger  one could literally butcher a cow  grind the beef  and cook it yourself faster than the  service  at this restaurant  one could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table  as well 
great coffee  very quick service and low prices  the only thing i wish is they were open 24  7 like they are on the east coast 
the food is delicious  but i wish the portions were bigger   my humans thought there was plenty  but i never have enough food   i am a 15lb dog who appreciates good food and good beer   i dont believe in diets  and i dislike cats 
the food is good   we had the combo plate which was filling   they have tvs with  sports and the place has good vibes   the one thing lacking   and needed    is horchata   i mentioned it to the staff and they came up with some lame brain excuse 
this business is quick and efficient smog check for  20   however  he charges  an outrageous  10 for registration  ive paid  3 at other facilities    also  when you go to sign the bill   he wants a  4 95  tip  for hooking up a hose inside your car   i felt this is wrong    the business is not a restaurant where a waitress is  repeatedly servicing your table 
goodbye waistline        and that sums it up    this business is not for the faint hearted  the name could not be more spot on  sweet addiction  cookies and ice cream  not to be confused with janes addiction as my other yelpers hh and rm tried to confuse me   located in a regular strip mall next to a few unusual 20 something stores  just on south apache and west reno ave  it is not hard to miss this place with a pretty easy to read sign out front   shakes  flavored milk  ice cream products are all served here  but the main attraction is the cookie sandwiches  ordering a customized sandwich to for fill any sweet toothed at heart   going with the rocky road ice cream with m ms cookie on one side and the chocolate cookie on the other  i truly believe that this would satisfy my inner fatboy  unfortunately it wasnt to be  although a interesting concept and half decent ice cream  i felt like this business missed the mark and went a little overkill  the cookies were not as fresh as i thought and the ice cream was run of the mill   although this place is unique  i feel now ive been there and done that  nothing really grabbed me to say come back other than the day i feel i need to eat my feelings   overall  cleanliness  3 5 price    food  3 4 back again  nope  thats a lie  if friends want to come here i cant stop them 
im glad they call it a market     understanding that one place or one business is a single market was kinda hard to understand  generally your either one thing or the other  but cost plus pulls the carpet from under traditional shopping and turns it in its head  whatever occasion  whatever you think you want or might need this business has a range of cool stuff you might be looking for    ive never been to any other cost plus but im aware they  have them in a lot of different places in california and nevada    products ranging from home furniture  art  alcohol and my favorite international foods   this is where i get all my australian tim tams  bundaberg ginger beer and vegemite from  they have plenty of british food as well  with assort sweets and lollies  candy for the americans    i was going to give this business 5 stars but they run out of some stuff a little to quickly   overall service  4 5 selection  5 5 coming back  always
bonjour  vous allez adorer la vue   if your looking for romance or one of the best views on the strip  you cant go passed the eiffel tower restaurant  located in one of the most obvious places in las vegas paris hotel   casino   attire  business casual would be the minimum i would recommend when dining here  when 90  of restaurants in las vegas are casual  eiffel tower has a higher than average standard   booking  as displayed in the yelp notes  there is two times lunch   dinner  you can either book online or by calling  also dont forget you be required to place a credit card down with your booking    so just a little run down of a few things    a  try and grab a table facing the window  depending on the time of year the sun can get in the way till 6 or so but well worth it  the views here are amazing   b  service is fantastic  our wait staff were very knowledgable about the menu but also they gave insightful information about other things to do after our dinner either at paris or other places in the strip   c  food here was great and my main dish of roast lamb was some of the best ive had in the states  however the appetizer of scallops were a little too fancy or dressed up which minimized the actual scallop   i recommend eiffel tower  it is a little heavier on the wallet but the overall experience is something that is well worth the visit   overall  service  5 5 food  4 5 drink  4 5  full bar  coming back  yes
calzones calzones  north west las vegas has a new unique family run calzone bakery that is ready to impress   located along the cross streets of farm and cimarron in the small strip mall behind the gas station 7  11   after seeing elite yelpers ty   lore checking into this new establishment  my desire for calzones for dinner was too much  being greeted by a trio of owners i had the sense of an already established mom   pop vibe   after running through the menu of calzones i ended up with the canadian bacon with pineapple and italian sausage  all were extremely tasty  with the bread seeming fresh  this is hand made calzones  not your frozen late night dinner meals from the grocery store   also a great range of italian sodas is also available   when reviewing presto they had only been open less than a week  but with a little help from the yelp crew i believe this is another quality addition to the area   overall food  5 5 drink  4 5 service  5 5 coming back  yes
great concept  not so good on execution   i wanted to love kidville really bad  the concept and sheer location is perfect for my little dude  but sadly this kidville fell short of expectations   located in tivoli village  kidville is a 2 storey children focused entertainment and education centre  with classrooms located upstairs and downstairs a kids clothing and hairdresser section   the first time visiting kidville i took my son to a class for a trial  being my first class i found it a little hard to find the actual room upstairs  its a bit of a maze  so ask around   being only two kids in the class i thought maybe this would be a great way to get acclimated to the classes  we had sing along  building exercises and arts and crafts  these were ok but my son was more interested in eating the glue and glitter that was given to him  i felt the staff were not bad and they had some good times with my son but i felt maybe the age group attached to the class was maybe a little off    the second time i came to kidville a haircut was needed as my son was rocking a pretty sweet mullet  and his hair was slowly covering his ears  so when we walked there were 4 staff members all chilling behind the desk  i asked about a haircut but they said the hairdresser was away for another week   i thought it was a little odd  as im sure they would have plenty of kids coming through there business  and also having 3 chairs just sitting there with no one to use them  its like going to a restaurant and the bartender being away    as i said at the start  i want to love this place  and maybe at one time it was a pretty cool place to bring kids  but with a few below average experiences  i might just pass on kidville  maybe when my little dude gets older ill try again
sun valley animal shelter helps provide a need for those shady puppy  kitten mills   i have had pets for most of my 40  years and have never had any issues with my furry friends  my 19 year old daughter decided she wanted a pet of her own and we of course choose to rescue instead of purchase  upon arrival we were greeted by an ill mannered older woman and a kind gentleman  we were given directions to visit with the cats and decide which one we wanted to adopt  we would then fill out an application and have an interview with an adoption counselor  the entire process took 2 hours and we left empty handed  we were told that because we might be moving in 18 months  because i travel in an rv  without my pets by the way   and we dont have a personality that  is a good fit  for any of the cats we were denied an adoption  they then gave me a list of other places to adopt who have  more relaxed standards    im an adult  my daughter is an adult  we were stunned by the ridiculousness of this situation but can you imagine a child being told they are not good enough for a furry friend that someone else threw away 
if you happen to find yourself hanging around in the cleveland airport  concourse c  either pray for yourself or wander on over to great lakes   the beer was particularly tasty   much better than you would typically find in an airport  unless you happen to find the sweetwater brewery in the atlanta airport  but i digress    the food is a ok  nothing spectacular  but getting a cold  on tap  craft beer while waiting for a plane takes great lakes up to 4 solid stars   by the way  i had the dortmunder  which won a gold medal at the 2010 world beer festival   it was damn good 
delicious    we got a living social deal  30 for  80 worth we had the calamari to start  our entrees were the  salmon and the steak and our sides were creamed corn and parmesan fries  everything was delicious  our cups were always full  the staff was very nice and attentive  we ended up paying  42 after the living social deal was applied  a little pricey but well worth what you pay  the fries are a must 
always impeccable service  this time courtesy of alan our server and his crew  went with the grilled octopus to start and was so flavorful and would get as an entry if available  adult beverages were margarita and leeches martini  both were excellent  we will always come here for the service and exemplary cuisine 
i wasnt that impressed with this buffet   for a weekend brunch buffet that cost  27 99 without champagne    12 if you want champagne  i had expected so much more  the line is ridicuously long to get in and we were all starving by the time we were finally seated   you would think i wouldve given this a 5 star since everything always tastes better when youre starving   but everything i tried was just ok  and there were only a couple of really tasty items   my favorite was the prime rib   my piece was perfectly pink and juicy   they didnt have as much of a selection as i had hoped    a lot of their selections are your standard breakfast fare like eggs and bacon  waffles  toast  etc   lots of fillers  so i passed on all of them   things to note were the crepe and omelette stations which were both fantastic but those lines are always pretty long so i just tried a little of my friends   dessert station was pretty good  but choices were nothing special   we did spot some macarons which we loaded up onto our plate  but they use a type of raspberry jam as their macaron filling and it was just waaay too sweet   we ended up opening up the macaron and scraping out the jam   for every single macaron   and that was still their best dessert   the creme brulee came in a close second  but they were always out    i took off a star for their meager selections and long lines  and another one for the lack of preparedness   if youre running a buffet  the first rule of thumb is to always stay up to date with your buffet items  never let the items run out 
holy cow     what can i saw  this place rocks  busy busy busy     get there on time  otherwise you will be there waiting for sometime  specially on the weekends   this is our sundays  goodbye sin city  breakfast place  you can share a plate with 2 people or unless  you are really hungry  have it   the chicken fried benedict was really flavorful  my friend had the chicken and waffles and we were just in heaven  aside from curing our hangover     the meal took us to another level of food coma  we had to sleep for another few hours before hitting the road back home   this place is a must    
having been here before and had a pleasant experience my friends and i thought it would be ideal to visit catch 22 tonight for happy hour  this was a mistake  after being served less than par  soggy nachos we had ordered the happy hour budlights  they were flat and tasted like they came from the bottom of the keg  after being informed by our server that they were indeed the bottom of the keg she asked if we could  stomach  them or if we wanted new ones  is this how catch 22 treats there customers  would you ask me to  stomach  raw chicken too  to make matters worse she  the server  proceeded to tell us she was going to give us a sample of the keg because she didnt want to waste another 6 beers  we said it was fine and she called out the female at the table said  is that good enough for you   wow  all i have to say is we could have spent our  70 on disgusting nachos and piss poor beer somewhere else and been treated more like a valued customer then this place   wasteofmoney  poorfood  badcustomerservice
best bakery around  im here a couple times a month for doughnuts  but usually end up getting a snoogle or five while im there too   i made a large  250   order of doughnuts for my wedding  as well as a cutting cake and anniversary cake  they delivered to the venue and helped set up   doughnuts are way better and cheaper than cupcakes  a great alternative if youre looking for something different 
love this place   excellent  friendly service and great food   the kind of place you definitely want in your neighborhood   great happy hour spot or place to bring the kids for a fun meal and teach them how to watch 5 different games at one time   top notch   5 stars   check it out soon   
the employees at this location are very rude  while i was placing my order i simply asked the woman taking my order to make sure my crazy bread was not burnt this time  she then proceeded to argue with me about it  a manager came out to see what was going on and eventually told me that i was no longer welcome in that store 
sushi  sashimi was fine  not spectacular  although they have a very extensive menu of rolls and some rice free rolls  which is more up my alley   kind of pricey for what you get   the special blue fin tuna sashimi  was  22 00 and i think we were served less than one ounce of fish  ive had blue fin at other good sushi places  got more and paid less   rip    no ayce  but a lunch menu ranging  13   16 is good for classic roll lovers that also want miso  salad  and rice included 
hmmm   not so sure yet  i have a group of twenty people coming in and staying at rrc at a discounted rate  which is very competitive  sometimes rrc rolls out the red carpet and sometimes they dont give a s it   i have a feeling this has to do with the disjointed affliation   ive had some very good service and experiences and some not so much   specifically  while not directly affiliated  the spa put a sour note on our weekend plans   i decide to use jw marriotts spa   jw was helpful  and actually i know from experiencing both they are better   the spa is on its snooty high horse  assuming we cannot  afford  their service   shame on you  you have no idea about us    oh right that is why you are a receptionist  right  too bad   you really have no idea   you should not judge or you will be judged   i am sure to update after the group weekend   
honestly i was worried to try this place but after ordering i will say all worries are out the window  best pizza in all of mesa and amazing fries  love em
i live in the neighborhood and have tried epic salon many times over the past years   i have always been disappointed   maybe because im not a regular  i get shoddy rushed service   the stylists can give a good blowout or special occasion hair style   however once the style is washed the next day  the lack of care is evident   split ends  uneven choppy cuts   epic is a very expensive salon  i will not go there again 
i decided to go on yelp and look for a breakfast place with good ratings   well you guessed it  this place came up so i told my brother  lets go   this place is located in an industrial strip mall next to a hardware store  once we got there there was line almost out the door    we finally sat down and ordered our breakfast    the wait was really worth it  i ordered the greek omelet and it was awesome   the food was fresh and was a hit  i will be back   they also serve lunch so i will give that a try   downfall is the restroom situation has to be changed to accommodate more traffic  it has a tiny bathroom and there is a wait to use it when its busy 
pretty good pizza in my opinion  its a cash only joint and dimly lit  could very well be my new go to pizza place  the large pizza was on the smaller side  so plan accordingly 
sometimes being too popular can be a bad thing    i get it  there is a constant stream of hungry  and most likely drunk  customers waiting to hand over money for some pizza    still    when a group comes in and asks for a whole pie  it is not cool to ask for double the price or charge them by the slice simply because you think you can get away with it    the pizza was fine  but their bad customer service really soured my experience 
wow such a cool vibe  great ice tea  unique and delicious omelettes    unlimited potatoes and toast  friendly service and birthday deals  you cant go wrong 
my friend and i were in kensington market tonight and we dropped by wandas to get some pie to go  it was my first time there   my friends key lime pie was delicious  light and fluffy with a real lime flavour   i got their famous cherry pie   so disappointed   my pie was  terrible   the crust was tough and there is something else in my pie that i cant figure out what it is   some kind of pulp  filler     one of the worst pies ive ever had   really disappointing after reading how they are famous for their cherry pie  waste of money and not worth the calories 
this store is like perusing the super awesome record collection of your crush  who is way more indie than you but still adorable and approachable about their collection  and might even let you borrow all their nice beatles albums   but its gonna cost you  this guy or gal loves their records  and believes that some nice simon and garfunkel is still worth  40  record  and a rare cover  banned  who cover might go for  30  i didnt think it was so racy it deserved to be banned  but what do i know about 70s standards   more obscure titles are  8  12  which is not so bad  i had a nice time browsing and picked up a few  the workers here were very nice and could definitely help you find anything you need  tracks in wax keeps retro records fun 
three stars merely for the happy hour specials  drinks are awesome  food is just meh  dont get anything with chicken  dry dry chicken every time  as far as the nightlife here i would say if youre over 40 youll have the time of your life  under 40 i say utilize this place for a few pregame drinks on the patio  otherwise youll be bored outta your mind feeling like youre out with your parents 
now that i moved out of arzano and have received my deposit back  the gate opener deposit since the security deposit option i took was non refundable   i feel like i can make a fair review of this place from beginning to end   i lived at arzano for 2 years 9  2013   9  2015  heres the breakdown   the good    some of the staff  tasha  wendy  the security guard and most of the maintenance  aside from 1 creepy guy that always seemed to pop up      the pool  clean  since furniture  rarely closed   gym is open 24  7    nice landscape   reasonable rate for a 1 bedroom  830   the bad    location  location  location  not a great one  cant really walk a block without running into a bad area  also russell and boulder is highly accident prone  just google it  while i was there  that intersection saw a major accident nearly every other week  so expect your insurance premium to increase if you move here  or expect to get into a accident    sam boyd stadium  when theres an event theres massive traffic and the noise level is ridiculous     staff member regina  most of the time she is very short w   residents and not helpful  my kitchen sink was broken  i reported it to her  long story short took over a month to get a new one  first she forgot to even put in the request then i had to follow up with her multiple times     broken gym equipment that never seems to get fixed  the ugly   super thin walls  expect to hear everything your neighbors do and say  i recall being woke up every saturday to my upstairs neighbor practicing for her american idol audition  it was horrible     terrible flooring   bugs  bugs  bugs of all kinds all year long  regardless of how much you clean or how many times you ask to have the place sprayed     no online access  cant pay online or request maintenance online  i mean come on its 2015  get with the program 
i would not recommend this company  they are priced reasonably well  but they did not do a good job  i have paint on my ceiling and it looks like they only did one thin coat because i can still see the previous color peering through in several places throughout the house   i think the worst part about this company is that they painted my entire downstairs lavender by accident and i still had to pay full price for the lavender paint job and the taupe color i originally wanted to cover it up   they also dont remove blinds and light switch covers  they just paint right up next to it  so you can see little spots of the old color underneath  basically  they just dont do a thorough job and they rush   at least that is what happened at my house 
excellent customer service and honesty  gave me many ac maintenance pointers that will be ease my problems and decrease the number of maintenance calls i need  very educational  also took the time to paint my ac vent cover that rusted from leaking condensation  a  thank you
we had a nice private function here and the staff was very helpful and friendly  the food was delicious and great value  we loved it 
in vegas for a work trip and our group went to firefly  not sure if it was this location or the other   fabulous food  and the mojitos were spectacular   if you get nothing else  get the stuffed dates  bacon wrapped  smoked almond  redwine reduction and blue cheese  oh my god     they were amazing and fabulous and rich and wonderful  everything that i had was really really good  the padron peppers are also great  these are some of my favorites  the lamb chops were really great with the sauteed veggies and veggies  empanandas were smashing as well  its a great place to go  get off the strip if you go to vegas and go here 
oh my god     go here  my only error was i forgot to ask for pineapple  soooo good  vampiro was meaty and messy and fabulous  the taco adobodo    al pastor  was moist and flavorful and i love the white sauce  the carne asado with and without nepalitos  perfect with a healthy squeeze of lime    the nepalitos  as a gringa  i would probably cut it into smaller bits  the slab of cactus was a bit much  but i liked the flavor addition  yum  yum  yum     y the flan was rich and creamy and 4 tacos and flan set me back  15  oh and horchata too  perfect for dinner back i  the hotel  then breakfast and lunch the next day     check it out 
i was introduced to this place through a car meet sponsored by fuku burger truck   i really love the atmosphere   there were lit up tables  a dj playing some good tunes  although the tunes arent exactly in my genre but at least they try to get people grooving while ordering their drinks   the set up with the tv screens give it that k pop ish feel to the place   the bartenders are very friendly and seem to enjoy their job   ive been here twice on wednesday nights and they have the open bar special until midnight  great deal but there werent very many people there on the weekdays   perhaps the weekends are a bit more hopping but otherwise i have met some awesome people here   keep up the good work and perhaps i will come back with a five star review 
every year my annual trip to vegas includes a trip to the crown and anchor british pub  they have a large selection of beers and play your  20 00 slots and get a free lunch  which taste great  and drinks  i will stay and play for a couple of hours  if you like soccer  they have special events for that too  
most unique coolest places ive ever been in   the owner was one of the nicest most welcoming people ive ever met  i came from ny to cleveland for one night and this place made my trip  i will be there everytime i come back to cleveland  it was dirt cheap also  it cost me 11 dollars but i left her a 20 because of how much i enjoyed it  cant wait to go back
their cookies are ok for the only cookie delivery place in town  but it should not take over an hour to get half a dozen cookies delivered to you  ever 
this place is awesome  the pho was so authentic  we also ordered a sandwich  i must say that the bread was some of the best  ive ever had   its a must  
only been here visiting a couple of times  very nice floor plans  box like looking buildings hide very nice floor plans and interiors  expensive rent   almost criminal lack of parking  so if you rent here  dont plan to have visitors over unless they park elsewhere and walk or you drive them over    lots of visitors parking nightly illegally in the bicycle lanes on 68th st    this is the same landlord as the facility immediately to the north  ninety degrees  and the barren property in the middle   and they love blocking the sidewalks with their signs  its against the law  the sidewalks are for pedestrians not signs 
hard to be truly pleased with any cell service so allow me to speak honestly   i have had no complaints with my t mobile service  or the service at this store  i have been using t mobile pre paid since 2006  i prefer t mobile since as a pre paid customer you can purchase any phone  pay full price  and only pay for the minutes you use  no wasted air time every month  and if they piss me off i can leave anytime   now if only we could do without the up sell in the stores  trying to get me into some sort of contract    comparing the pre paid services  i found t mobile to be the best deal   remember  the decision for which cellular carrier you should pick should always be based first on which one offers the best signal in the places you are most likely to use the service  remember too  cellular is two way radio  the coverage with all carriers will always be spotty in some places due to terrain  interference  or signal obstructions   i used to have net10 prepaid  but they send text advertisements to your phone and will not stop  so i dropped them  otherwise they are the cheapest prepaid but their minutes expire rapidly  t mobile minutes last for a year after you reach the  100 minutes purchased mark   and for the record  their advert for  worlds largest 4g network  is misleading  their 4g network comes no where close to the technical specs of a 4g network  its closer to a 3g network  the term  4g  means something specific  not just 4th generation  t mobiles so called  4g   is not a 4g network any more than my 8mm video tapes are vhs  to advance to a true 4g network would require new phones and cell site hardware  they did not deploy either   this is nothing more than a marketing gimmick   update  a friend of mine with the t mobile 4g hotspot device gets an average of  800mbps down and  2mbps upload  even at 3am   this is about twice the speed of 3g  like i said  its not real 4g
great place for water and the smoothies are the best  owner is great too always helpful  always smiling 
tried going to the other location on spadina initially but it was too busy and there were no tables available  decided to keep walking  checked on yelp for more coffee shops and came across this location  this location is kind of hidden and hard to find  its a lot smaller than the spadina location  a lot less busy as well  its quite dim inside but a nice  calm and quiet environment    there arent really any tables in here  just one small narrow one and high tops along the side of the wall  a good place for take out i guess     the drinks itself was amazing  i loved the latte i tried  my friends also enjoyed their drinks  they had americano  london fog  and espresso   all very bold flavours and aromatic  the latte art could be improved though 
tried the lap cheung and seaweed egg waffle with matcha green tea soft serve  i really enjoyed the ice cream  it was very creamy and you can really taste the matcha flavour  would definitely go back for soft serve  the egg waffle was okay  quite a unique taste  sweet and savoury with the lap cheung  quite crispy but i still like the traditional egg waffle at pmall  tong tong  better  it was quite expensive for what it is because each item is sold separately  the soft serve was  3 50 and the lap cheung waffle was  4 50  they make it fresh to order  but i think the wait is a little long for what it is   15 20 mins  for one egg waffle with ice cream  good thing its located in the food court of the building so there are seats to sit and wait  the service was really good and friendly  if youre sitting down at the tables they will bring you the food which is kinda nice  this also means the workers are attentive to their guest for remembering their face and order      
the girls here really need to tie up their hair when serving because i was served a glass of water with a piece of hair at the bottom of it  that is just gross  already ruined my appetite    the service at this restaurant is really bad  not the friendliest and also really slow despite the restaurant not being busy  it took forever before our server came to ask for our drink orders  never offered refills until asked    next  we still had a slice of pizza left on the platter and as she was asking us if we were done with everything or wanted anything packed she threw someone elses dirty tissue onto the pizza platter before we got a chance to decide if were packing the food or not and then tried to pick it off  
been waiting to try this place for brunch for so long  first time here and it was such an amazing experience im definitely coming back and recommending it to others    the food was amazing  the blackberry and blueberry flap jacks was really good  really fluffy pancakes and loaded with fruit  tastes amazing with the maple butter     the chicken and waffle was really good too  i could taste the chicken was a little bit dry but still better than most places  i cant wait to come try more of their menu items  i tried these two items cause i hear good things about them and it seems like popular items off yelp  i wish i had the stomach for more    the ambiance was fun  energetic  and casual  just very positive vibes  the decor was cute and creative  the service was top notch  everyone was very attentive and friendly  we got greeted and seated right away  and our server came around several times to check on us and top our water  manager  supervisor also swung by to ensure everything was perfect  food came out in a timely manner  definitely an ideal place for brunch with a date or just catching up with friends 
hands down  best ice cream ever  i could tell there are some asian inspired ingredients based on the flavours they offer  e g  vietnamese coffee  pandan  etc   ive had these flavours in different parts of the world but i have to say they perfected it here  my favorite ones were pandan and che thai  they rotate their flavours everyday which i realized that when i came back again the next day to get some more ice cream    their ice cream is more on the thicker  creamy side but thats what made it so great  apparently  other people agree since there is always a line from the store to the corner of the street all day  i wish there is a place like this back home 
i love this bar so much we came back the next day during our visit to montreal  we must be old cause both times we came  around 5 7 pm   we always get a table and never stood in line   there was a line forming on one of the nights that we left later  i e  9 pm  and like other yelpers mentioned  you might have to wait before youre allowed in    what makes this place so great is that they do a numbering scale  1 5  of how strong the drinks are  i am not a fan of the taste of alcohol but i do want to get buzzed sometimes  so when i saw they had several drinks in the lower half of the scale  i was more than ecstatic  i had their exotic fruit drinks and wow  they were so good  it wasnt super sweet like youre drinking straight up fruit juice  if i was from this area  i would definitely come back once a week  must try this place 
they have great food and a nice wine selection  it is hidden in an office complex  i did not know the place was there until i lived here for five years  odd location 
viewing this place from the outside  it sort of reminds me of a restaurant you might see at an egyptian themed theme park or water park or something   its pretty cheesy   it reminds me of the set design in the movie cleopatra with richard burton and liz taylor   the food was overall pretty okay   i went with a group of co workers and what i got was just okay  but i grabbed a piece of something that someone else was eating and it was pretty fantastic  so  like anywhere  it depends on what you order   the portions you get are quite large   im cursed with an insatiable appetite and they sated my hunger 
im sort of a glutton for punishment for going back as many times as i have   they have this one thing    its scrambled eggs and kielbasa and vegetables and holy shit its good     but on two separate occasions  i came here and i straight up didnt get acknowledged  given menus or a chance to order   do you know how embarrassing that shit is to see someone come in after you and get drinks and their food order in before youve even gotten a menu   i just came back on saturday and we asked the waitress if we were going to be helped and she said  in a really shitty way   thats not even my station    so  fuck me  right   not your station  not your fucking problem   or    dig this  treat me like a goddamned human and say someone will be right with me   just sitting there without menus  without even a glass of water  not even a kind word  while everyone around me is getting taken care of   nah   fuck that 
we came here for opening night of newsies and it was outstanding  the space is beautiful  very artistic and vey cool lighting  plenty of bathrooms  i dont even remember the last time i didnt need to wait in line during the intermissions  and for the most part they were well kept  the seats were comfortable both for myself and my 6 foot 6 inch tall husband  he also noted that he had adequate leg room  which is rare  the staff was all very friendly from the ushers to the bartender  sidebar    they only have drinks   the delicious looking cheesecake picture at the top of this page is no longer sold much to all of our disappointment   the sound acoustics were amazing and from our view it looked like there was not a bad seat in the house  parking is close in a structure  and we were able to get out of the structure within five minutes  another rare theater experience  the show itself was outstanding  if we could afford to go again tomorrow we would in a heartbeat  seize the day and buy your tickets to newsies asap 
angels does a nice job of being a solid beer bar   dinner spot  the food is good  to the point and well made  the menu has a nice variety and pairs well with the beers    the beers on tap are diverse for all types of beer drinkers  the place is spacious  the staff is knowledgeable and friendly  and the pricing is very reasonable     even though the place isnt very comfy and the decor is cold and uninviting  i can still see myself coming here pretty often  the beer selection  food  vibe  and staff are really good 
unique   varied bottle selection with a knowledgeable staff   comfortable seating area make this a very capable wine bar     cheese plates spruce up the modest experience without overwhelming your appetite   also of note its always nice to see quality wines being served by the glass   definitely recommend az wine co 
solid beer selection to represent a british pub theme   food is also above average with classic british pub offerings    service has also been very pleasant during my visits   the main factor for the 2 star rating is because im forced to sit here and listen to awful jason derulo songs on the juke box because their touchtunes doesnt have the feature that allows me to pay extra to play a song next  poverty juke box features ftl
we love this place  theyre really good and very much experienced  we feel like home every time we get our nails done  we love myloan  shes the owner of the place   her staff  tiffany  tina   vivi  theyre all friendly and the place is so clean  i would highly recommend this place  i i could rate 10 stars or more  i would do it 
fish is not fresh  need more of a mixed green without iceberg for salad  they should also mix the sauce in the poke  also overpriced for the product  drive the extra 7 minutes to ahipoki bowl  avs on top of the bad food the service was horrendous 
i love my doctor  she and the staff are always so friendly and loving  ive only had one  bad experience  but that was because she had the flu  they always make things very comfortable for me  i love them  ive been going here since 95  i will never change 
i loved it  i had the peach cobbler with was excellent and the perch was perfect  the greens had a little too much salt in them but they were still really good  i used to go to bubbas bbq but this will be my new spot when im on that side of town  i want to try everything   its a very small area so im not sure it would be the place for you if you have more than two or three in your party  the people were very friendly and down to earth  the cook even came out to talk to me  hes funny  i liked him a lot   i think you should try it  its real southern cooking 
this is a great place to knock back pitchers   if you can get yourself a table at bikini  youve got it made  buddy     i like the diverse crowd of hipsters  grizzled old dudes  tough guys and the occasional homeless guy who comes in with a pillow  asking you where they have blankets   thats a true story   and then he started singing along to a michael jackson song  but didnt form any words whatsoever   he sort of looked like n xau from  the gods must be crazy    im gonna miss that guy   in the restroom  one of those miniature xxx things tumbled out of the vending machine   a gift from god   or  so i thought   free half inch in diameter porn   the instructions told me to rub the chicks binki until it went away  but that didnt work   i tried using a quarter like it was a scratch off or something  but i just ended up mutilating it   it was macabre   in a weird way  i felt like lenny from of mice and men   i tried to be gentle  but i accidentally killed her   this place is great   i always have a very  very good time 
deseret industries is unlike any other thrift store that i tend to frequent   the clothes here actually fit me   just last weekend  i bought a pair of jeans and they fit me so well   ive never really had thrift store pants fit me too well because im so short   im only 55    as such  whatever i buy i need to cuff on the bottom   no matter what  i look like 1 1950s hooligan because everyones legs are just so much longer than mine   i bought a sportcoat here about two years ago and its still the nicest fitting coat ive bought for myself from a thrift store   dude  man  you have no idea   it fits me perfectly   and it was cheap   the inside label informed me  to my girlfriends amusement  that it originated from a now out of business store from california called  the short shop  clothes for the shorter man    well  this place isnt for everyone   but  for some reason  almost everyone who donates clothes here is apparently just a little guy and i thank them for their donation 
if i could buy a delorean and rev it up to 88 miles per hour and confront my past self and give him some advice  it would be this   dont get arrested   it sucks   its really stressful because arizona is not very lax about marijuana laws   people go to jail for quite a while   luckily  i was in jail  actually the marshals office in tombstone  for about an hour and thats it   this place is a joke   i know they gotta do what they gotta do  but they buy into bullshit psychology evaluations that determined that i was at risk for being addicted marijuana   they gave me 36 hours of counseling  these guys did  not the court    they did it for the money  of course   the longer youre in the program  the more money you have to pay   altogether  i shelled over more than  300 to these people   sometimes i had to sit next to stinky tweekers   during the hour long class sessions  youd have to tell a sob story about your addiction   if you dont  its a fucking battle   so  each week id make up a story about my on going battle with marijuana addiction   they get an extra star for the 8 hour long classes i had to take   i learned a lot about how to get away with a crime      also  i got to go to an aa meeting because of this class   that was    bizarre 
the cornish pasty is sort of my go to place when i have friends coming in from out of town and i want to take them somewhere fun   almost all of my friends give me the  duh  face when i recommend we go eat at the cornish pasty    whats a cornish pasty    if i had a nickel for each time i heard that question asked  id have enough money to    i dunno  id at least have enough money to buy a 40 of mickeys   or a can of sparks   there are so many different pasties you can choose   everything from mexican to greek to traditional american fare to the classic bangers and mash british faves   and theyre all good   a lot of their better ingredients are homemade   each pasty has love baked right into its flaky crust   i dont each there as much as i used to  mostly because i sort of exhausted myself  but i love bringing friends so i can relive my experience of the first time i went there   everyone else has pretty much already said it  but this is absolutely one of the best places to go eat   if youve never been  you should really go   the food is great  the beer is great and the whole atmosphere is so damn jolly you cant help but  at the very least  enjoy yourself with friends for the night   quite legitimately  this is about as good as it gets 
waited ten fucking minutes and no one acknowledged us   and they were out of everything bagels  which is weird  considering their goddamned name   how the fuck can a place called everything bagels be out of everything bagels 
the clarendon is a hotel with a real level of charm to it   ive been to a lot of hotels and most of them  most of the higher end hotels that cater to a lot of business travelers are so dull and lifeless that its almost extraordinary that you could deliberately suck all of the life out of your hotels decor   this hotel does have some genuine life to it and its the small things that make the difference  like playing music underwater in the pool   better yet  playing awesome music underwater in the pool like the cramps   ive always liked staying at hotels in my own city   its fun not being home  its like having a sleepover as an adult without having to crash on someones couch and wake up the next morning with a fucked up back and shoulder   gallo blanco is a big reason to enjoy coming to the clarendon   they make a mean michelada   throwing dill in there is a great idea  it adds a pickly taste and a bite that just takes the drink to another level   i guess my only real complaint is that its a bit overpriced   i booked the room for 80 some bucks which is  you know  whatever   thats usually kind of the standard rate for a hotel room in the mid range  plus it came with a high def flatscreen tv  no hbo  though    a lot of high class hotels continue to have shitty tvs in the room and it boggles my mind   still  when we checked in  there was then a  15 per night fee that included two bottles of water in the room and snacks at the front desk  which is like    man  couldnt you build that into my hotel room price initially   so with that and a lodging fee  not including tax  it ended up being over  100   not nearly as good a price i thought it was going to be when i first booked the room   this is still a really fun hotel and a place id recommend people to stay if theyre coming in from out of town 
this is my favorite place  i find myself to come here almost every week  lovely place  affordable and nice customer service     
we wanted a really good italian meal away from the crowds of the vegas strip  so worth the drive  i had the eggplant parm served with perfectly done pasta  my husband had the pasta chicken cacciatore which he loved  both of us also had a caesar salad to start our meal   everything was done to perfection 
this place is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the entire east valley  you simply cannot find this level of service  quality food and atmosphere anywhere else in the state  i come here to shop  to eat  and to people watch  you must try the market dip sandwich  i get mine with the brisket and it is the best sandwich ive ever eaten 
the prices went up recently i believe as i ordered a large steak burrito and the price was very different from a few weeks back  at the new price its not worth it  before it was a cheap option open late in mississauga  i always call ahead as it can be busy  the hot sauce sometimes differs it can be hot or just medium ish  the meat sometimes isnt fresh   had some cold pieces of steak once  there are better burrito choices now other than burrito boyz 
there are few pho options near by this area so it is refreshing to have a pho place so close by  live in the area   popped in to try it out and ordered pork and meat ball vermicelli with spring roll for under  7 as takeout  everything was fresh and tasty  the spring roll was very good and reminded me of a filipino spring roll  lumpia shanghai   the meat ball was delicious as well as the fish sauce and vegetables included  lettuce  carrots  and bean sprouts   however the pork wasnt plentiful and a bit overcooked and dry  for the price however  it is tremendous value  i just wish there was an option of sizes  quantity  it is very decent inside although small  hope it is here to stay 
this location is beautiful and the fact that its the only drive through starbucks in the area makes it so convenient  the problem i have is the inconsistency of the drinks  for a company that has pretty extensive training on how to make drinks you would think the drinks would consistently taste the same every single time but at this location they never managed to get it right  maybe one out of ten times do i get a drink that taste like it should  so now i just basically use this location to redeem my free drinks on the app other than that i would recommend going down the street to safeway starbucks because their drinks taste amazing every single time 
we love barros pizza in cave creek so decided to try the anthem one when we were up in the area  never again  first pizza we got was the bbq chicken  when we got it home the chicken was cold and not cooked  the crust was soggy and we could not even eat it  we called and talked to the manager and that was a joke  she was rude and wasnt even apologetic  we were up in the area again last night and figured they couldnt mess up a regular pepperoni pizza  boy were we wrong  pizza was super thin  soggy and dripping with grease  im not sure whats going on with this location  barros pizza is my favorite but i will never go to this location again 
stayed at the encore tower suites  i was treated like a vip  they had private check in  private valet  everyone was really nice  i had room service  and the food was terrific  and fast service  i will stay here again 
awesome pho soup cannot beat the price    9 50 anywhere in this area  service could use improvement however the food and prices are well worth going back 
absolutely horrible quality control  none of my cabinet or drawer faces were without defects  my local rep told me to put it all in and email and theyll resend them  well see  so disappointed  some of the drawer faces were off by 1  8 of an inch   
great place with big portions  loved the food there  and the service was great  went there with a group of 4 people  and we waited in line outside for around 30min  but it was worth the wait  the place is a bit small  but the service is fast  and the food is filling  it was my first time trying it  but it wont be my last    recommended 
so  my review is not really indicative of the quality of the food  although if i were reviewing that  id probably give it like 2 5 stars  thoroughly average fare  really  the beer is nice  but nothing to get too excited about  moving on   i ended up here with a party of 12  celebrating a co workers impending move to california  i ordered the grilled salmon with polenta  and it was ok  again  nothing special  until i took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth  since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy  i did a double take and took the crunchy thing out  rather than swallow it  this turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass  not only that  but when i cut into the middle of the polenta again  on the grounds of  this merits further investigation   i found  another  piece of glass  right there in the middle  not huge shards  about the size of my pinky nail  but big enough to cut internally if swallowed  my co workers and friend that i was with were all witnesses to this   ill give cbw credit for handling this about the way youre supposed to  as soon as i told the waiter  he told the manager  who came over and was super apologetic  obviously comped my meal  i got replacement food  and drinks  and offered me dessert to take home  thats great and all  but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food  i can see a completely different scenario where i accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries  or even just cut up my mouth  that story doesnt end happily for anyone involved   most places you go  you dont expect this to happen  doubly so for a place that charges  20 a plate  if thats the level of diligence that goes into food preparation at cbw  i dont think i could ever recommend it to anyone 
gaucho is always fantastic   this trip three of us shared the paella   paella is served in a 15 inch pan  which was more than enough for all of us for a total of  50   we did not get any bread or sides   with apps or sides the paella dish would feed 4 6 people   the dish itself was very good with a nice amount of mussels  shrimp and clams along with chicken and sausage 
this is a review for the restaurant right off the lobby  very nice  the best iced tea ive had in a long time  delicious quinoa salad  the guy had a very good mac and cheese and perfectly cooked steamed asparagus  i would recommend this place for lunch if youre in the area 
the cafe that changed my opinion of this town   lux is the kind of place middle aged women go to pretend they are hip  the place where you wont find any seating unless you come at an odd hour  and most of all the place where i find myself pretending to study but end up just being amazed at people who are actually studying   best coffee in town  considering the size of the kitchen and that they do all their baking and cooking in here  the size of the menu and the outcomes of every dish that ive had in the last 4 years are astonishing  from pastries to quiche  mac and cheese to steak dinners this place can make whatever youre craving with honors  also probably the most hipster bar ive ever seen  but boy do they do it right  wonderful cocktails and decent beer and wine selection    to some its a magical place  to others its a over hyped coffee shop  either ways this place has established itself and definitely deserves a try 
hello coffee lovers   sip  savor  socialize   i drove all the way across town yesterday just to try this much talked about place   may i be honest   well  the good first  upon approaching the lovely shop  i see many  hip  stylish folk enjoying the sun as they sip on their latte    so  i walk in and  wow  i immediately love it here   wonder  why  oh why  do we not have one in henderson    green valley area   i mean  we are hip too  at least  i am       the decor  the music  the people  the vibe   all tops   however  since i did not have time to stay i decided to get a fazenda lagoa to go   i was all excited to sip the hot  dark liquid and then    the unexpected happened     i tasted filter  i tasted the filter that they poured the espresso thru    now  i do not wish to be unfair   so  i tried again and again and still the same yucky filter taste    am i alone   i really wanna love them     well  anyone who knows me   knows that i love coffee  there is no doubt about it   so  with that being said    i will give them another try and take the time to savor the ambiance and the java     i look forward to another visit and the ability to maybe socialize and blog my little heart away for any number of hours     i have the feeling that sneaking away from the humdrum of work will be well worth it    cheers   your constant companion    deirdra
you know whats up at starbucks    not too many words needed  i like that this location has the normal style bathrooms that i am used to at all of the other starbucks  its a pretty large size with ample space  very clean  and new  of course   check it out when that thirst hits you    your constant companion    deirdra
what can we say    i love sushi is our refuge at the  of the week  if we miss a week  we feel out of sorts  why    because the service   food is top notch  best chefs   ladies in waiting    your constant companion    deirdra
always good  yummy eats    bison burgers    i mean  come on     my hubby loves them  i no longer eat red meat  however  if i did    this would be my spot for it      i love the broccoli soup  chicken salad  hummus platter    not like original hummus  however  still pretty good       if you are on the prowl for some healthy  yummy eats    then  this is the place for you   besides the fact that they are neighbors to starbucks       your constant companion    dee
if you want good korean food  this is the place to go  the owner checked on us several times and had to turn guests away 30 minutes before closing because they sadly ran out of food  come early so you dont miss out 
the food is pretty good  but honestly    these folks need to get their act together  came in here once and they said happy hour was only in restaurant  then hostess argued with the bartender and said happy hour was at the bar  my party of 7 got frustrated and left  i gave it another chance  manager said happy hour okay at sushi bar  server charged us full price  i complained and then he said nobody told him  is that my fault  this establishment needs to have a better pre shift before they open  they should just have happy hour throughout the restaurant  i spent a hundred bucks and left still pretty hungry  the drinks were pretty good  though 
the food here is great  the service is fast and the owner is always here checking in  i come in pretty often and they remember what i order  even if i change it  i wouldnt go anywhere else now that ive been here 
to me  this isnt so much a fancy brunch place as a really great breakfast joint  the menu is short and simple  the eggs are perfectly cooked   i bow before a cook who can consistenly make an omelette thats firm and yellow  not burnt brown and falling apart  aunties and uncles does this every time  the only other place i know in town that does is jacques bistro  where the omelettes are twice the price  and  btw  worth it    when i saw the croque monsieur  i thought it was just a pretentious way of saying grilled ham and cheese on challah  but when i tasted the subtle dijon  i understood  it makes the sandwich   weve lost most of our old fashioned diners  stem  rip   aunties and uncles is carrying on the tradition  bravo 
i dont get it  people go to a place that has ramen in the name and complain that it serves    uh  ramen    loved kenzo ramen on a frigid winter night  hearty tonkatsu ramen  with a rich pork bone broth  yummy chunks of pork  a daub of spicy garlic on the side of the bowl that you can mix in or leave out  depending on who youre planning to be kissing later the same day  i suppose   my  much  better half went semi healthy with the sapporo ramen  a slightly larger bowl  full of veggies and miso goodness  gyoza app came after the soups   the only timing misstep   and we were so full we took half the order home     and all for less than  30   just what we needed   cant wait to go back 
i love this preschool  my son attends this wonderful school and he enjoys going every day   i took a long time choosing his preschool this time  and this was by far the best one i saw  the teachers are experienced  caring  talented  creative  and responsive  parent involvement is high  and the staff is great  when you walk through the doors  you know you are in a place that truly cares about children and their development  i am so glad i found pvcs 
i dont know how good they are but my wife said they suck ass  thank god i was at work 
the food was average  the service was good  but the place was cramped  unless that was the vibe that they aimed for 
the place looks pretty clean and nice  the seats doesnt have cup holders but instead it is located at the bottom right corner in front of you  that is not too convenient  i went to the final fantasy orchestra and when it ended  it took me an extra 6 minutes just to exit the place because there was so many people and people were barely moving  what if a fire break out  i would be dead by then 
been here more times than i can count since its literally a 2 minute drive from where i live  very busy on weekends but always consistent in food quality   indonesian fried rice   its delicious  i would never get excited over this dish but it goes very well with a lot of other dishes  if youre a big group def order this   coconut curry   this is pretty yummy especially on top of some steamed rice  get sick of it pretty quickly though   pad thai    my favourite dish and always delicious  portion is huge for one person  pineapple chicken and beef    delicious but the beef is better than the chicken in my opinion   roti    super yummy but gets stale very quickly so this should be one of the first things you eat coconut rice    meh tastes okay  the steamed rice is better   overall awesome place with huge portions  they are also super attentive and caring when it comes to any allergies or food intolerances which is a huge plus for me 
we had 2 free buffet passes from playing myvegas so we went before seeing ka  we really enjoyed it not sure why all the bad reviews  they had cooked to order steaks which were great and tons of other choices  i didnt care for the desserts that much  i would go back even if i had to pay 
i think crawfish is one of those things that people either love or hate  they have a texture  flavor  and look that you just have to get used to in order to enjoy crawfish  personally  i have only started to try crawfish when it became popular here on the west coast with all of these new crawfish spots popping up all over  and again for me personally  i dont really like getting all messy while eating either  and i dont do well with spicy foods    so how did i get here to hot n juicy with all those personal caveats i pointed out  of course someone had to have a bday party here and i had to go  but  i do say i did enjoy the food here   i got a half pound of their garlic butter shrimp at the baby wimpy spice level and a pound of the crawfish of the same seasoning  butter really does make everything great and although the baby wimpy spice was kind of spicy for me   i drank a lot of water and took french fry breaks between cracking open crawfish and shrimps  next time i think i will get a potato  extra  to go with the crawfish because it looked tasty in my friends bag 
i trusted yelp and this time i got burned  i should have known that a mexican restaurant full of gringos was a bad omen  but i stubbornly thought that a four star average on yelp cannot possibly be wrong  so i went ahead and got seated  i think everybody is just way too excited about the cheap drinks at this place  i didnt drink   maybe if i had a few  1 99 margaritas in me  id be more willing to go up to three of four stars     the service was slow but very friendly  so  1 star for that  but thats about it  the food  although a nice large portion  seemed like it came out of a microwave  and there was so much yellow  only partially melted  shredded cheese on top  it was way too much  the horchata was grainy and   foamy  the chips seemed stale and the salsa was mediocre at best   my wife is mexican  i know how good authentic mexican food can be  this place seemed closer to taco bell than a real mexican meal  id actually rather have a taco bell chalupa than go back to this place anyway 
this was my first visit  they had sent a birthday coupon so i decided to try them out  we got the  slims plate  which is a 5 piece tender  includes fries  toast  and 2 sauces  i added a side order of mac and cheese  the chicken was very fresh and flavorful  not overly breaded  the fries were seasoned well  and the mac and cheese very cheesy  we got a slims sauce and a cayenne ranch  both of which were delicious  only thing i would change is i wish there was more sauce in the cups  and the toast was somewhat bland  overall a great first experience  ill be happy to come back and try them again 
i visited this place on a whim  browsing through yelp to find a place for lunch near work and have been twice now   both visits have been excellent  i have tried the chicken katsu  and the spicy chicken   both were so delicious  served with rice and macaroni salad on a bed of cabbage  the flavors were addicting and the meal satisfying  portions were good  and reasonably priced   ill be back for sure 
one of my favorite breakfast spots in vegas   epically since i try to eat as clean as possible as often as possible  the protein lovers scramble is amazing and the fresh squeezed juices cant be beat  pretty decent coffee too 
come here for your costume needs   anything you want for cosplaying  costume partying  or just art will be here  it is a shop that is stocked year round for pretty much any occasion  they are moderately priced and have an up to date website with their selection  beware around halloween though  it is so crowded you can barely move  theres even a shuttle bussing people to separate parking areas   jeez 
very solid place for desserts and of course chocolate goodies by jean philippe  it looks like a snack bar but with a lot of chocolate  gelato  crepes and sandwiches   theres two area one is for food and the other is for crepes and gelato  i know this is a top of the line name but 13 bucks for a crepe and a scoop of sorbet is a little much  i did enjoy my experience here everything is really nice and colorful  i just wish  i had more time to spend here  i probably shouldve bought some for family and friends 
i got here about 10 50am so i had to wait for them to open so when they did i was so happy  none of the wait staff were there at 11am when they opened so they apologized about the wait  i ordered a bbq burger with a jeffs lemonade which was very good  they also had some gourmet burger which were about 16 bucks but i just got a regular one  i didnt see any shakes on the menu maybe i missed that section  the restaurant is pretty much outdoors with a cover like a patio or something  the weather was great so it wasnt an issue being outside  my burger was really good and pretty juicy but i think my drink was the star of the show 
super gross  under cooked fries  greasy burger made with sub standard meat  cheaper than jack n the box for a reason  and staff was cleaning the hood during biz hours  yuck  
so happy i found this place near mountains edge  great ambience and even better food  
had the hog burger it was so nice and juicy also had their union rings and man oh man and i stuffed after having a real deliciousness butterscotch pudding and banana shake it was to die for and the waitress was also good over all really good experience
juan and pancho running he restaurant  rather then chang and wong  need say more    food had no flavor of real chinese food  lol
if i could do 2 1  2 i would but i cant so ill go with a solid 2 stars  food was decent  good spices and the chicken was tender but more pasta then chicken  two people spent  85 not all that
when we got to this location we clearly asked the lady that was closing in the next hour or so if the food was still fresh and hot  of course she lied to us half of the food was already cold and was not even warm enough to eat  and the sushi was funny tasting the fish taste so fake  i would not come back just seems like another chinese buffet to me 
was here for two hours getting two tires fixed  was first i  line and other customers where getting out of this location faster then me when i arrived first  then some fucker named henry kept lying that it was being worked on when my truck was still outside   lying to the customer  long wait  not even courteous   failure
we recently had a stay at sls on the weekend after christmas  overall  the place looks nice  its a small hotel  but the design is pretty modern  also they have a variety of restaurants from cheaper ones to more upscale  so that was a plus since you dont have to go elsewhere to eat  that pretty much sums up the good things about this hotel   now as far as my grievances go  i have three main issues   1  wait time for the front desk is ridiculous  we had to wait a good 20 30 minutes before even getting to speak to the receptionist  they need to rethink of their system and maybe hire more staff for the front desk if need be   2  staff members are not friendly  they dont have a smile on their faces and just really makes the guest feel like they dont want to be there  it brings down the whole experience of those staying at the hotel and makes you not want to come back   3  lastly and most importantly  they had charged me twice for the room  initially  when i booked the room online  i was already charged in full price  i was expecting upon check out to just be charged the resort fees  but again i was charged for the room fees  i had to call their accounting department and was asked to  send them an e mail of proof that i had paid full price   this is a mistake that really should not be happening  when i had spoken initially to the front desk they had told me that i already paid in full price so i dont understand how it can be that i get charged again   for a hotel that is just beginning to have their start in las vegas  this one is not starting off in the right track  granted they are somewhat cheaper  but unfortunately it is true when they say   you get what you pay for   stay away and go to a different hotel  even if it means you have to dish out a little bit more money  at least you know you will get quality service that you are expecting when you stay at a hotel 
across the street from mandalay bay  super liquor is the closest and cheapest place to buy hard liquor at the south end of the strip  the selection is big considering what youll find elsewhere on the strip  there is also a decent selection of beer and wine  some chilled in coolers ready to drink  if you need mix  theyve got a good selection to choose from as well  i agree with omar v  getting a flask is the way to go 
i know a lot of people have been dumping on this place  but i think its pretty decent  no they dont have a squat rack or olympic lifting section  but they do have a full set of free weights and a pulley station    for lower body resistance training  they have the smith machines  anyway  at this price point you get what you pay for    no complaints 
this place is definitely a decent stop for general health food products  do not come here if youre looking for produce of any kind  they dont sell it    the manager was pretty cool  and gave me a discount cause i bought a semi bulk quantity of protein powder  ive also bought various supplements  beware though  their staff isnt the most helpful or well informed when it comes to their product selections 
if you live in phoenix and you have never been to this place  shame on you   you have been missing out   my husband and i were in phx for a short vacay and after standing in the hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes  i told him we are not going to chino bandido but the closest mexican restaurant we can find on yelp with the highest ratings   lo and behold  it was mariscos playa hermosa   literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find     we are so glad that we were able to find the best mexican food weve ever had while in phx  but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip   every meal after this was just not cutting it   therefore  we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that mariscos playa hermosa closed at 8pm on sundays    you really cant go wrong with the menu   the first time  i ordered fish enchiladas and my husband ordered the garlic fish platter   both were amazing   their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious  as well as their salsas    the 2nd time we went  i ordered the camarones culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w   vegetables   both were amazing again   however  if you go here i would highly recommend the camarones culichi     just because its not something you find  at any mexican restaurant   it was so delicious that i licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp  and i dont care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same    now  if you cannot handle spicy foods  you may want to be very cautious   maybe order an horchata drink to go with the meal  or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness    anyway  i dont want to hype it up too much or you might be disappointed 
i have no idea why the previous reviews were so poor   i rent cars pretty regularly  and have rented twice now from this hertz location  and both times my experiences were so excellent that im taking time to write this review  cant say i normally do for car rentals    yes  it is maybe a 2 minute walk to where you pick up the car    welcome to toronto  i would be shocked if you could find a car rental without having to navigate through an underground lot   however not only is it extremely well marked in locating the car  but hertz actually provides a little map with its phone number on it in case there are any issues     the two times i have rented from here  the customer service has been excellent   very friendly staff  and also very quick and efficient   the first time  they offered me a great upgrade at a low price  a new challenger    and the second time  which was the very busy easter weekend  i accidentally had made the reservation at a different hertz location  and they not only found a car for me  kept the same size of vehicle i had requested  and honoured the price   there are no hidden fees with these guys and i really appreciate how quickly they get you out the door   thank you hertz 
love this salon  conveniently located  amazing massage chairs while youre in the sink  and anthony is a hair god   scheduling him can be tough though  so book as far as you can in advance 
this place is a dump  no class in vegas what so ever  why hasnt anyone started a gay club with a little class  dirty dark and nasty inside  expensive poor quality well drinks   20 cover for out of town visitors    total ranking  f location  a drinks  d  ambiance  d
both brothers are really professional and courteous  and the girls that fit you with the classes are really funny and patient withe the clients while choosing your classes  i now live in california but i am planning a visit to vegas for more glasses and sunglasses 
the food here can actually be a little hit and miss  but i love the grilled cheese club with fries  i get it way too much  people make fun of me   they have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards  fyi 
amy needs to get her ass in gear and make me some coffee  stat 
really great value  all you can eat   unlike most places  they offer sashimi as an option for all you can eat  so youre more than capable of getting your moneys worth 
pokito has one of the best poke that ive ever had  ordered the classic salmon bowl with mixed greens instead of rice for a lighter choice and it was yummy  the service was also really good  the person who worked the cash was really helpful  since it was my first time there  he explained the menu and helped me decide on what to order  the atmosphere was pretty casual   a good place to grab a quick bite to eat 
this place is a pretty cool  quiet little place  i had just watched season 3 of narcos  which is pretty good btw  and was in the mood for some latino home cooked meals  this place didnt disappoint in terms the atmosphere  it makes you really feel the latin vibe    the service was excellent  they recommend stuff if you havent been here before and were really helpful in there descriptions  needless to say  everyone there was really nice    on to the food  my girlfriend got the pressed cubano and that was amazing  the cheese and the bread and everything inside was just so gooood  i  on the other hand  had the short rib dinner  wasnt too impressed with this one  it tasted really good on first bite  but after that it needed some flavour  also  the rice came with way too many beans  kind of over powering if you ask me  and then we tried the yuca fries  which were okay  again  just my opinion but i would prefer the regular fries  but if youre willing to try something new and different  definitely try the yuca fries    overall  cool experience with some pretty good food
i know  i know  i know   i know what youre thinking  a  buy here  pay here  auto dealership  there cant be anything positive to say about what they are peddling  right  wrong  youre absolutely  100  wrong   our oldest was in desperate need of his own vehicle and as a direct result looked to cactus jacks as  well   really   a last resort in the auto buying market  not because he had mixed emotions about the notion of it being a buy here  pay here  rather because he was unsure as to whether he would be able to get a conventional loan from another dealership with minimal to no credit   he did his research  found a couple of vehicles he somewhat liked  and after looking at them at their current location wasnt entirely sold on either of them  that said  he asked if we could go to the location on west bell road in surprise  i willing drove him out there and we browsed the parking lot for a little while before we met up with their sales person  he asked the routine questions about price range  payments  etc  to get a better feel for where our son was financially  after viewing a couple of cars he showed our son he opted to introduce him to a vehicle that  for two hundred dollars more down  would do well for our sons purposes   no haggling  no nonsense  just straight talk and our son was sold    our son took it for a test drive and absolutely loved it  thought it would be perfect for his needs and opted to spend the additional money to take the leap  an hour and a half later  he was driving off of the lot in a shiny 2009 kia rio    i would recommend this dealership to anyone who is struggling with financial restraints and finds difficulty in getting a traditional auto loan  they are fast  honest  efficient and friendly 
cafe bene is probably my cousins favorite place to study or chill  when i really miss korean desserts or just the environment of a korean cafe  cafe bene is the place to go  i always go to new york  toronto  with my family and i stop by cafe bene  this is such a cute and spacious place to catch up with your friends or have a hard core study session  what i usually get is the shaved ice dessert  for those who dont know what it is    it is probably the best thing you will ever taste  it condensed shaved ice milk and usually with red bean and ice cream  now there are many different types and topics  i usually like the green tea one  yes   that is all i have to say other than it is very aesthetic and big major korean memories    go to cafe bene   
love the food  staff and ambiance of the place   i have been eating there for 4 years and just love it   my favorite dish is the 2 fish tacos with black beans   they also have great wines at good prices 
we used leolinda to buy our home in sun city grand and also to sell a home  she is well informed and knows the market well   she is very pleasant and professional to work with  we throughly enjoyed our experience and would highly recommend her to anyone buying or selling in the surprise az area 
west has been redone and its fantastic  was there last night and i had a great time  very cool atmosphere and friendly staff made for a very welcoming experience  i was able to try a sample of the food that will be available to the general public and it looks like their going to kill it  i tried an old fashioned that was one of the best ive tried in the city  really enjoyed my night here and will definitely come back soon 
rating is closer to a 3 5  dropped by union coffee company around 7 am on a friday morning  i was really excited to try this place because of the stellar reviews and of course because of my love for cold brew  there wasnt really a crowd when i went in and i was greeted by the person at the register  i was feeling something iced so i went with the iced cold brew latte which comes with milk and simple syrup  you can swap out the simple syrup for a flavored syrup if youd like  but i wanted to keep it really basic so i went with simple syrup  so lets get down to the taste of the cold brew latte  this particular brew seemed to have a strong citrus flavor which frankly i am not a big fan of  furthermore  there was no real depth in terms of flavor  it was a bit forgettable in my opinion  i did pick up a stamp card with the intention of returning in the future and perhaps trying a different drink  aesthetically  this place is beautiful and polished and nice  cold brew wise  not so great 
we have tried many indian restaurants in the phoenix area and we both agreed this was by far the best    i had the butter chicken and saag paneer and  paneer naan   everything was served very hot and fresh and was just delicious   i cant wait to go back and try their buffet and was happy to hear it is also served on the weekends   our waitress was very friendly and the manager came over to make sure we were happy with our meal as well   will definitely be back  
great alfredo   staff is very friendly and helpful  we have been there several times and it is consistantly great 
prices have increased   i also got a hair in my food and it took forever to get   quality of the food has also become more mediocre  and menu offerings arent very impressive anymore   used to be one of my favorite places to eat  now  its overpriced and disappointing 
i always feel welcome here   i get tons of compliments on my hair  maytee works her magic   voila  beautiful    thank you maytee   true essence   
really great service  food very flavorful and fresh  made to order  owner is very nice and accommodating   bernie hanna
we ate here for a quick lunch  as we were eating  food that i was not impressed with at all  we see someone in the kitchen with gloves on digging her fingers in her mouth  we dropped our forks in disgust  she then starts messing with dishes  with the nasty gloves still on  i go ask to see a manager and the hostess said there was not one there  as i am doing that  the waitress comes to our table and asks if everything is okay  while this is going on the same lady starts picking her nose with those same nasty gloves  the waitress says not to worry she is only a dishwasher  we told her that we understand but she is touchy plates and silverware that we eat out of with those gloves  she also said there was no manager  everyone was listening to us and starring so she asked us to leave and told us we did not have to pay and that is all she could do for us  do not eat here
we got to see the whole cast   ron dale came out and took pictures with everyone  free tour was great  got to see them actually working   love this family 
pros of this gym  24 hours  it can possibly be only  10  month   cons of this gym  the equipment is old and most of the machines need repairing  it is not the cleanest gym in the world  and the way this company tries to squeeze every penny out of you  no matter what it will take  i even work at the gym and i was being charged a membership  so in a perfect world  i would have gotten back about  200  in reality  they only gave me back  15  smh
2 5 stars  its hard for me to rate this show because im not such a huge elvis fan   he died when i was less than a year old so its a little hard for me to relate to the music even though a lot of them are very familiar to me   my biggest gripe about the show though is that it felt a lot like watching a movie about his life because many parts of the show were just that  movies of elviss life   i wish theyd have less this and more action which cirque is known for   there a couple of nice acts though   i think the best act occurred early in the show about elvis and his twin brother   if youre a big fan of elvis then youll probably love this show   for example i saw a lady a few seats ahead of me crying her eyes out at the end of the show   if youre like me though and  likes  elvis but probably wouldnt pay to see him in concert  then you may be disappointed 
if you want to leave vegas feeling cheap and ripped off at the same time  you should come to this nightclub   i spent one weekend with some friends in vegas for my birthday and we decided to come here one night   i was warned that there will be some strippers that will almost force you to buy a lap dance from them   sure enough  about 15 minutes in  a couple of half naked dancers dragged us up to the second floor so that they can give us a  tour  of the place   well apparently they run a pretty tiny club since we went directly to a small room thats only closed off by a see through curtain   everything then happened so fast   my friends paid  left and within minutes i got a half naked cuban dancer dancing on top of me asking me if i would tip well if he were to show me his pee pee   i didnt say anything and in 15 minutes it was over    much like a grindr hookup   the biggest difference though is that a grindr hookup wouldnt cost  100 like the lap dance did   leaving the barely private room though did feel like a walk of shame so in that sense it did feel kind of a like a hookup   luckily i was able to join my friends downstairs for some drinks and dancing so the night didnt end that badly   when i got back to la i told the story to some of my straight friends and they said that a lap dance would cost 3x as much at a straight club so i was actually getting a bargain   oh you poor straight people    
my favorite ne ohio sushi and hibachi place  service is very friendly  food is tasty  sushi is good  some of the japanese students at a local college suggested it to me as they liked it  great place to get your sushi fix 
look elsewhere  tried this place out and was not worth the hype  it is a hole in the wall and for a place that prides themselves on their food  they should really work on their customer service skills  when i asked my waiter   waitress   cook what do you recommend  i was given a look of confusion and anger  then not to mention the food was not that good  im staying far away from this place 
for the amount of food that you get  i dont see why people are complaining  you do get a lot of food  obviously with take out chinese food it is hit or miss and from what i have ordered  the food is good enough to go back  my favorite thing to order is an order of crab rangoon with general tsos chicken  it is moderately priced and i still order from here once or twice a month 
really love this spot   its cozy with a nice view  the bread is fresh and soft   service is welcoming  friendly  and on point  selection is great and tastes very good   love the clams in white sauce   the bread in the sauce is so yum  my favorite wine by the bottle is the german riesling  30 if you like it sweet   nice date spot 
my mexican girlfriend told me this was the best tacos in vegas   its right by my house   last time i ordered the pork and it was good   today i got the steak tacos this time if flour tortillas and guacamole and sour cream   very good and probably the cheapest meal i ever eat at any given time  they also have my favorite drink orange bang  havent had it anywhere else other than zippys in hawaii 
great service  cozy seating  the chef comes out to go over any allergies   when the server asked about allergies my friend mentioned seafood  obviously not in the breakfast items we ordered   it was nice that the chef came out to assure us anyway   ordered monkey bread  all the ingredients were enticing   for sure filling enough for one person as an entree  i left behind a quarter of it as the sweetness was overwhelming   still so delicious and i crave it 
referred by a friend   called to make an appointment  always long wait times over the phone  all day  came in here for routine check up and screening and flu shot and prescription   only seen the nurse practitioner  never saw the doctor   she told me she would get back to me with results either way   the visit was pleasant   this was oct 21   fast forward it is now nov 25  i called a week ago because my prescription isnt covered under my insurance pending doctors prior authorization   made at least 5 calls regarding this  no exaggeration   all long call wait times  not always given a call back   i asked for my results out of curiosity only because i already have them on the phone  only to find apparently the lab never gave them results   they left me a voicemail to call back by 5pm   i made a call back at 4 30 and he was on break  they told me to call back   4 45 and i just get sent directly to voicemail  the following day 9 30am he is also busy and i am told to call back  all calls long wait times   finally it is 2pm and i get results that require a follow up     had i not requested the results i would never have known   one month later  at my request  after 2 days   after i request  waiting time  i get information that i need   unacceptable   so i call the specialist they referred and my follow up appt is dec eighteen    on top of that i call again today   it was necessary for them to give me a call back  of course   low and behold i am still waiting for prior authorization on a time sensitive prescription   i am really upset  frustrated  and do not feel well cared for 
went here on a work injury at 7am on a saturday after a holiday   everyone warned me of 4  hour wait  when i arrived there were maybe only 6 people waiting  from the time i sat to the the time i got out 3 1  2 hours   there are tvs is the waiting room   a nice little coffee machine with a good coffee and tea selection   theres a room just for eye exams   i also got some head x rays   the good advantage is to get everything i needed in one place  no need for referrals and additional wait times   im satisfied with the doctors examination  however the wait is long here and i hope i never need to come back 
one of the best mexican food places  everything was delicious  the staff was super friendly  cant wait to come eat there again 
it is fast and it is healthy  i wasnt blown away with flavours  though    they are dog friendly  yay    so we will be coming back 
ok  i came here for nye 2010 it was  185 for unlimited bottle with 4 ppl min and  150 for unlimited drinks hear you can get unlimited drinks during regular business times not just nye  first off we had 6 ppl total and we prepaid for the table because it was nye  right when we go in they said there will be a table fee of  100 thanks for mentioning that  ok thats fine were here already  table were actually nice we had a booth that could easily fit 10  we knew that they were only doing  well  bottles for the unlimited bottle service  we got a bottle of vodka and whiskey to start with they bring out the bottles and i have never heard of these brands in my life been around restaurants and bars all my life  both disgusting  they had premium liqueur at the main bar which had to be 40 min wait with no signs of slowing down even at 2 am but my head would of thanked me the next morning if i did wait  dance floor was tiny in actuality probably only fit 40 ppl tops  ok now for some positive things  hrmm great view of the strip and   wait thats it  
their chorizo burrito is the bomb  so delicious  i recommend it with added beans and youll be in heaven 
best pollo fondidos  nowhere else can come close  the cheese crisp is also great  i cant say anything about how good the service or is  or any other entree  because i am always enjoying my pollo fondido 
discount tire always has the best customer service and wide range of products to fit almost any need   the service is consistent no matter which discount you go to  however the guys at this store are always willing to help and follow through on what they say they are going to do   took my vehicle in because of a low pressure warning  turned out there was a piece of metal in it   they diagnosed the problem quickly but did not have the matching tire in stock  was i disappointed  sure  but the guys got on the computer and found a tire in salt lake and had it set up for delivery   was told i would get a call next day when it arrived   sure enough i got the call  but it was bad news the tire did not make it  was i disappointed  maybe a little but they kept me informed of the status and set my expectation appropriately   tire arrived next day took the truck back and in 30 minutes was back on my  way   i  love discount tire   
i saw dr wong at the craig road office   hes a great doctor and his assistant is great too   he explains everything including costs is contacts and best deals and had me in and out of the office on 30 minutes 
jeremy was originally going to stop by and give me an estimate then he went ahead and mounted two tvs for me on the spot  hes very professional   competitively priced  and knows his stuff  i plan on using his company for my home theater installation as well once he finalizes the estimate 
youd never know such a hidden gem exists tucked behind a dump of an old shopping center  but when you open the doors the foodie gods will sound their trumpets and the angels will sing    this place is a find    not stuffy or pretentious  but the offerings are on par with the best ive had anywhere   fantastic  spare decor  friendly host staff  amazing  vibrant  and creative craft cocktail list  fantastic  funky and often way out of your comfort zone menu selections   love their tasting menu that allows you to taste any three items on the menu for  45   we added a shared appetizer  whipped goat cheese with charred beets   probably my favorite dish of the evening   
i hesitate to review this place because i dont want it getting so busy i cant get a spot  hands down the best sushi pound for pound in las vegas  ive eaten in just about every high end sushi spot in town  this place has the highest standards and probably the freshest fish in las vegas  and it wont break the bank  simply amazing highly recommended 
long lines  but the food was good  the big issue over the years is that more and more people show up  and the planning does not keep up with the growth 
after reading the other reviews  i had to write   eating at this restaurant was an amazing experience   we were staying at the wynn  but actually came back a second day for the noodles   our servers were wonderful    jimmy and kay   they definately added to the experience   they also recommended dishes   when i asked about some of the dishes  they directed me away from those that they didnt think wed appreciate   the hand made noodles were wonderful    was it pricey  yes a little  but again its vegas    40 for lunch isnt terrible 
steak  yes steak  more steak please       impressive entry down a circular escalator   how is the possible   in a brightly lit lobby with  dancing lighting     three of us went for a business dinner  but of course my business did not pay because if we did wed be bankrupt    pricey  very pricey  we shared the chateaubriand and bone in ribeye medium rare   cooked perfectly medium rare and both obviously perfect cuts of beef  we had the seafood tower as an appetizer it was loaded with goodness    we sat near the outside on a wonderful night and i really enjoyed the little electronic light and music shows that went on from time to time  i did not know about this feature  it was very creative    food all was wonderful and enjoyed bay all  our waiter was attentive and staff was courteous for the most part   stepping aside when you walked by and many thank yous and may is     as expected the bill for 3 with wine was 600 dollars plus tip  worth every penny   if someone else is paying unless its your last meal but  it will be a great one 
every time i visit my friends in mesa i force them to take me to tommys   they never disappointment me   love everything i drink and eat here   i also love to shop downstairs 
fired pie is amazing  we went to the one in ahwatukee  and i cant wait to try the one in tucson  the pizza is absolutely delicious for a nice afternoon lunch  and the prices are hard to beat  my only criticisms  the staff was a bit slow and unresponsive  when we asked for napkins at the table  the server never really came back  but  the restaurant is mostly self serve  so its okay  also  the  3 pookie is so cheap for a reason  the cookie is truly meant for one person  so dont try to share it  we tried the pesto chicken pizza and the veggie pizza  and both were out of this world try this place now  just be warned that the portions arent too big  and shouldnt be eaten for a dinner   more of a lunch dish 
was in town on friday 3  20 for the weekend to see an as game and stumbled upon this great place   i got the falafel salad and sis got the flatbread pizza with kalamata  tomato  etc   she said her pizza was perfect  flavors were great  cooked perfectly  my salad was good  the falafel was a tad overcooked and came out crumbly and dry     but  the greens were fresh as were all the veggies in the salad  the tahini dressing was great  got a bit extra on the side  the salad also came with 2 large  warm pita breads  so i made little sandwiches with all my greens and falafel  the falafel had a goood flavor  but it was a bit hard to cut in half as it just broke apart   the jalapeno cilantro humms was wow  could have used a bit more jalapeno  but we totally understand that they have to please a wide range of people     our server was adorable  kinda tall guy  blondish hair  very sweet  made suggestions  helped   water filled    great guy   he was so sweet we left him a huge tip   probably a working student  so we wanted tohelp with tuition       d  anyway  wish i lived closer  id try other things on the wonderful  diverse menu 
update  all i can say is  theres salons and other barbers  but you gotta come in an check this place out  ask for jose  every time i think i cant look any better than this cut  he proves me wrong    i use to get an 8 dollar high fade at sams salon  but i decided i needed a new hairstyle  so i grew out my hair for about a month and a half and decided to come here  the first time i went here it was on saturday at noon and it was so packed  i almost went home until jose said he will take care of me and i thought that was very cool of him  the he gave me a bald fade with a comb over and i was forever changed and never going to any other place  the second visit  i asked for the same cut but parted and a bit grooming on my facial hair and i walked out feeling so fresh like a million bucks  jose told me hes been cutting hair since middle school and really took the time and years to master his craft in hair  i am telling you  do not think twice about this place  just come here and i promise you its worth every dollar 
great selection of ice cream and had a fresh nutella cookie   owner was super friendly and even brought water to the table for my party   would go back again 
went here for the first time  nice little place  isnt fancy schmancy  but the chipotle chicken wet burrito was delicious  i got the red sauce and man was it spicy  not like obnoxious hot  but like a slow and strong spicy  it was really good but at the end too much for me  ha ha  i would definitely go back and try their other options  i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice quick bite to eat  the parking is scarce but was well worth the wait 
decided to stop by and check out their cupcakes since i was just down the street having lunch  the cupcakes were very delish  i got the salted caramel and red velvet  i cant wait until the next time im in the area to try the others   
this place reminds me of all the greek owned restaurants back near chicago  people are really friendly and cool  and because it reminds me of the greek owned restaurants you know the food is delicious  i try to come out here every couple weeks to show my support  definitely a worthy place to take my chicago friends to when they come visit 
this shop is just as sick as seen on instagram   been planning this tat for many months  michelle is a sweetheart and very helpful  joseph is super professional and creative  i gave my concept idea and he ran with it and it surpassed all expectations  worth every penny   great music played all day and positive vibes    love you guys and thank you   i will be back  
service is not great and they try to charge you for basic items like lemon when other restaurants give them for free  food taste was average  not much items to choose from  would not recommend this place 
extremely slow service  have to ask a lot of times before the servers remembers anything  had to wait for a table even thought there were empty seats around  small portions  kim chi tofu soup have no kim chi   will not visit again  all of the soup taste the same 
i really love their house special noodles  especially the soup and the garlic bits that you can add to it  their pho is okay tasting as i have had better elsewhere  service is okay  portions are too small and hours of operation is too short  last call at 9 45pm   prices are too expensive for some items like spring rolls  would not recommend this place for pho 
los dos molinos was located near my hotel  so i drove there one night without knowing much about the restaurant  i love it when you are not particularly expecting anything and the food turns out to be quite delicious  i did not think the salsas to be that hot  as some had mentioned  but i like my food quite hot  the service was friendly and efficient  very large serving and quite reasonable for what you get and i certainly enjoyed a couple of large margaritas 
this is a good diner  the food is tasty   the coffee is great  been here for breakfast and lunch  satisfied both times  servers are friendly and fun 
ok  so i am back  today is a much better experience than my last visit and i am delighted to be here  the happy hour choices are very good  yummy    they have bacon wrapped sliders  score    beers  wine and burgers with friends     a great place to enjoy the finer things in life  cheers 
went to hear an excellent bluegrass duo yesterday  and had dinner there    music was great  but food and drink were mediocre   i guess they strive for consistent  6 5 7 5 food   on a 10 point scale  because they can   have a big following and are busy all of the time   meatloaf was bland and green beans watery   martini was small and diluted   not worth  12   only reason to eat there is the show   speaking of the show  the music is great and the crowds are good   nighttown should spend some money to improve the venue   and the experience   for example  we sat along the back wall and could not see the singers   how hard would it be to put high tops along the wall so that customers paying  25 each for a 1 1  2 hour show can actually see the performers    
new and hip  the sls is small hotel casino situated off the strip  we booked a deal with flight for a bachelorette party for a pretty good price  the check in process was easy and no lines  upon arriving in the room  we noticed it was very minimalist yet stylish  we liked the huge mirrors and the lighting concept    unfortunately  after the first night  we experienced a severe smell of smoke and marijuana in our room  it seemed to be coming from the vent and we called the hotel to see what they could do about it  they said the only thing they could do is to send someone to filter the air for 4 hours and thats it  when we came back to the room  the room still smelled and it got worse through the night  they refused to change our rooms and we suffered through it  thank goodness we werent staying at the sls for too long or else i may have had a severe allergic reaction to all the smoke    will definitely never book at the sls again 
i cannot wait to go back to liberty market   i had the farmer pressed sandwich and it was delicious   the side pasta salad was good  too   the other sides and desserts looked amazing   i want to go back and try everything   also  staff was very friendly   you just get a good vibe being in there 
giving this place 4 stars  when i walked in  i was a little deterred by the wat it looked inside  very small  but we sat down  the waitress was very nice  she helped us with the menu since not all of the items on the menu had a description   we ordered the creamy mermaid  jalepeno bomb  volcano roll sunset roll and rock n roll  the food tasted fresh and came out quickly  i would not order the creamy mermaid again or the rock n roll but everything was pleasant and i had a good time  they even had a wheel to spin for a prize on your next visit  would recommend and return 
theyre very inconsistent with their taste  i ordered a mango a gogo and there was no taste at all  ive been going to this jamba juice since i was a freshmen at 2011  i completely stopped going once they got a new staff and the quality of their drinks became horrible  no taste whatsoever and ive given them more than two chances  and i still got drinks with no flavor  so ive definitely avoided this jamba juice since then  also  this new staff is much slower than the ones before 
went here to get mt samsung laptop fixed  they were able to fix the damages  since i dropped it  but they also  changed the program features of my laptop  before  i could zoom in  zoom out and slide up and down with me mousepad  but that feature disappeared once i got my laptop back  along with it were features from windows 7  i went back to get it fixed  because i wanted those features back   a tan asian guy with sticky hair and gauges didnt help out at all  he acted like he was the supervisor  but he did not  help me get back how my laptop used to be  he pretty much shrugged me off and said i had to reboot the computer to get those features back  keep in mind  i still had my warranty and have a geek dquad membership   he acted like he didnt know what i was talking about when those features clearly existed in the other laptops  stupid customer service with a supervisor who was no help at all   theres no point of getting the geek squad membership  its a ripoff and theyre not going to be much help  disappointed  you work to help resolve conflicts with your customers and those who have a membership  do your effing job 
i want to highlight that i had some hiccups in my purchasing process  but was contacted by mark santos the general sales manager and was able to voice my concerns  he was quick to ensure i was properly taken care of and more than made up for the inconvenience i experienced  he is a true professional and centennial toyota made a great choice when they put him in charge  great management makes a great company  thank you mark for taking great care of me  i will continue to be a loyal centennial toyota customer 
i love this place i take my fur babies here this is the only vet thats allowed to see my babies my puppy needed surgery and they took care of her i couldnt be more happier with a vet keep up the great job of taking care of fur babies i tell everyone about this place
came here once and i am in love with their broken rice  good food for reasonable price  will be back 
lots of hype  paid for the  12 00 wash and it came out dirty  this was not what i wanted or paid for  the entire front of the car is still filthy from sitting at the airport  i thought maybe by paying for the top of the line car wash  id actually get a clean car  since i didnt leave the car until we got to the house  i didnt see the dirt  buyer beware  check the car before leaving the property 
service really good  they will describe the menu for you  so dont have to be worry if you cant speak french   the food is fabulous  everything here is worth to try 
i have finally found my  soulmate  gym  workout   ive done several of the  bob  award winning places in charlotte  but they cant hold a candle to this   heart rate based training so i know how hard im really working out   know if i need to step it up   cleanliness is very important at this place which is a big thing for me   plus  its well air conditioned  even the treadmills have fans      great staff   trainers 
no doubt about it  the history of this establishment is inspirational  that being said  i doubt i will be going back there very soon  i am not a pizza snob by any means  and have eaten everything from frozen pizza  airport pizza  fast food pizza  and genuine italian pizza  but this pizza just fell off target  i got just a slice of the plain cheese pizza and could tell that the cheese was definitely fresh and the dough homemade  however  the sauce was overly sweet  the dough was a bit tough  and overall it was a rather bland piece of pizza  it fell somewhere between italian pizza and american pizza  but sadly failed to be either 
awesome experience  she is passionate  professional  and extremely knowledgeable  shes helped us train our husky puppy who is 5 months old  the training has curbed leash pulling and has taught our puppy several commands  worth every penny 
delicious food  friendly service  and a great selection of beers  i used to go to the shadyside location  but i really like this new location  the decor is modern and appealing  and it makes for a nice atmosphere when they open the garage door style windows during nice weather  its an awesome new option for good food in oakland 
well worth the wait  highly suggest the fried chicken benedict   the chicken was moist   the cream sauce was delicious   spicy  only negative was the bland bloody mary
we had such a great experience at the trump  for the people who are complaining that there isnt a casino   did you do any research on the hotel when you booked the place  hell  even hotwire lists that its a resort  not a casino  we really enjoyed not having to walk through the smokey casinos to get to our room  the trump was immaculate   so clean and smelled so fresh    the saturday we opted for a cabana rental which was so cheap  we paid  150 for the entire day and that included an air conditioned cabana with a fridge full of water and sodas  our own daybed outside of the cabana and a waitress  the staff was really good and we always had a drink in hand  it was well worth the price  especially considering just how expensive other cabana rentals are at other hotels    all in all  we think we found a great gem  its a little off strip  close to the mall and they have a shuttle that can take  pick up to wynn and caesars  i think we will for sure stay here again for the price  the service and the overall experience 
ive been there many times and they are always very good  when you go out to eat with five people ordering five different things  usually one is not happy with their meal  this is not the case at casa del sol  the staff is great  the food doesnt take long and the price isnt bad either 
i was extremely disappointed  truly poor customer service  for a birthday meal  i organized a group of friends to meet  i have 3 food allergies for ingredients that are not typically listed on the menu and the waitress said she  had too much going on  to help me pick an option i could eat  she did not even go ask for more information  i asked other staff  including the hostess  and they would not help me either saying that wasnt their job  when i pressed on with the waitress  she asked me about ingredients by naming them in spanish    i dont speak spanish  we waited 70 minutes for a table they said would take 40 minutes and it was not worth it  overall  a terrible experience and a huge let down on a birthday with friends 
i ate at this restaurant with my parents and this was not a pleasant experience at all  despite all the hype weve heard about it  both my mom and i have multiple allergies  first of all  the allergy menus were depressing even to look at  and the food options were extremely limited  it was over priced when you have to take out big ingredients to make it work  but pay for everything anyway  we were given the wrong menus  dinner instead of lunch  and ordered from that  then had to go through the whole process again with a different menu  it was extremely disheartening and took a lot more time since its so difficult to find something we can eat and actually want to eat  after that  we were given an incorrect drink order  our server didnt apologize for either mistake and had an unpleasant attitude throughout the entire meal  the server asked what kind of medical condition we had that caused our allergies  or if it was a lifestyle choice  my medical condition is personal  and i find it rude that the server asked  by asking if it was a lifestyle choice  it felt like the server doubted our authenticity and felt we were being an unnecessary nuisance for needing help with the menu  overall  everything was handled poorly and i see no reason to ever come back 
this is my first time ever dining at a portuguese restaurant and went with 6 people  waiter was the only server but spoke very good english  had a great personality   was attentive to all tables  and explained dishes well  chicken  steak  cod  salad and paella were all fantastic topped off with the red house wine  would definitely go back if in the area again 
i needed a job done before christmas and they delivered  great job from my friends at this great locally owned business  framework came out perfect and they really helped make the art stand out with their expertise 
always an interesting menu concept and the place to be for craft cocktails  numerous legends frequent behind the bar here  if you want an amazing cocktail that youll never find anywhere else  this is your spot 
best kept neighborhood treasure  good food  plenty of room  great service  and so close to home  will definitely make more visits here  dim sum is pretty good  too 
this jack in the box experience went south really quick  we pull through the drive thru because my brother was hungry  when we arrived the greeting was  hello  like the conversation  was taking place on a cell phone  i was taken back  but continued saying   one moment please   i rolled my window  up  so my brother could gather his order without confusing the drive thru worker david  david made a remark that we needed to hurry up  my brother immediately lost his appetite  and keep in mind we were only at the window 2 minutes max  we called to speak to a manager and got the run around from the shift lead lashawnda  a simple and easy visit went south due to poor customer service 
best in vegas  omar and the servers are great  bean dip  chips and salsa to start  everything tasted authentic and fresh  will only eat mexican food in vegas here 
so far my stay has not been great  mostly because the service at this hotel is poor  hilton honors members not treated well    they say you get a free drink  good luck redeeming it    had lunch at the beach deli  the club sandwich was dry over toasted poor  the matzo ball soup had very dry chicken in it  i suspect not really made in a pot    come to vegas 3 4 times a year  wont stay here again  nobody cares 
the best sushi in town    dine here daily never had a bad experience service is excellent and always have the freshest fish   thank you mr  takashi  
rude  rude  rude   if i could give them a rating lower than a 1 star i would   the lady that answered the phone claimed to be the owner  manager  supervisor and would not connect me to george so that i could complain how rude she was   dont see them being in the insurance business for long   
i have had the pleasure of having dinner at both cut three times over the last three months   while i believe cuts food is near the best in las vegas  i actually believed delmonicos had a slight edge with service and i am just a big fan of ribeye in general    however  this past week  the impeccable service at cut made me a true believer   the general manager gianni toffonello is extremely professional and did all the small things necessary to make our dining experience truly amazing    we were there last night to treat our good friend to one last blissful dinner before his deployment to afghanistan   among the people in our group  we tried the japanese kobe  american wagyu filet  and waygu new york sirloin   the quality of the beef was apparent with each bite   and most importantly  there was no flaw in the service   i am a huge believer in customer service and i believe that when my friends and me are treated with respect  it makes me want to share my excitement about the restaurant with the rest of the world  i have no doubt that i will be returning to cut during my next trip to las vegas   it is now a staple of any vegas trip 
we wanted to try somewhere different  the food was good  everyone that was there were extremely friendly 
the ambiance here seems fun and the food was good and reasonably priced  i had a banana tiki drink that was fun  i had the tofu bowl  which is huge   super filling as well  it had perfectly crispy tofu on top of rice  beans and plantains  a great green sauce was on it as well  i also tried the wasabi mashed potatoes  didnt really taste the wasabi though  the only reason i didnt give this place 5 stars was the service was off  the table was dirty when she sat me down even though it was a slow night so there were plenty of other options  it had sauce splashes all over i had to wipe myself because it took some time for the waiter to have time to come over   even though there were maybe only 6 other tables at the time  id go again with a group  vegetarian friendly 
sara the owner is very friendly some one is at the front desk to answer any questions massage and salon areas very clean   i enjoy hot stone massages by stephanie
food is great    on the pricy side but i think its worth it  the service is just so so 
not really my go to place for shawarmas  they messed up  singed  my chicken so badly it was like eating ash  didnt even ask if i wanted the special sauce so all i got were maybe two tiddlywinks of it to mask the gross chicken taste  not to mention they premade the chicken hours prior so it was lukewarm at best    two stars for the beef shawarma  it tasted really nice  how a shawarma should be    not premade as its pricier and not what people normally order
kick ass fries    no more mccrappy meals for me ever again     went through the drive through  got my food and started driving away  started to eat the fries and went  hmmm something different about them    they were perfect  potatoes  oil  salt  thats it  not the tiniest bit of grease on my hands or the bag and cooked perfectly   the burger was the best fast food burger i have ever had  seriously   again  they keep it simple   toasted bun  tasty meat and not greasy at all  howd they do that   people  next time you need fast food  and i know you all eat it dont lie  go here and see for yourself    the chains are crap  this place does it right  and its a cool find your friends dont know about 
so  i went here for the uye yesterday and for their monday yelp specials    for a dollar   the margarita was very good   where in the hell were all the other people that said they were going to show up  it was just me and two other very nice yelpers   the place was dead while we were there and i didnt get any food   will go back to check out the roof when its open again  promise 
we came here with a large group and had a blast  the room was challenging but fun  definitely worth checking out 
we had a quick lunch here after my winning streak at the wynn and before heading over to window shop at the mall  the man went with the special of the day kobe beef sliders with fries and i had a caprese panini    both of our dishes were served on house made rolls which were fresh and tasty  the sliders were beautifully presented and delicious and the fries were crispy and perfect for sharing  my sandwich was nicely balanced with ripe tomatoes and good pesto which was mild enough for my guy to eat  he doesnt typically like pesto   we sat outside under a large umbrella with a waterfall right in front of us giving off a lovely breeze  it made me think of being in hawaii and i forgot for just a moment we were in 105 degree weather   the ice cream concoctions other guests were eating looked yummy as well  but we abstained 
as a creature of habit or maybe a new tradtion  mom  grandma and i had dinner here my first night in phoenix  yes  grandma had a coupon and yes  i tipped behind her  but the service and food were good and those cheddar biscuits are still the bomb    long live this rl location 
every time i come to vegas  regardless where i am staying  i have to trek over to caesars just to go to the forum shops  i have loved this place since i was a teenager and though there are tons of high end places  there are more than enough regular old places to shop as well    restaurants have come and gone  i miss the stage deli  but have found pj harveys now  and luckily can spend hours here without spending a lot of money  unless i want to    i will definitely be back 
by far the best italian restaurant in arizona  i feel like i am back in italy when i step into this place  when i get my food and take my first bite its like my 100 percent italian grandmother was in the kitchen cooking  complete satisfaction from the service to the atmosphere to the food  even the valets are cool   a  highly recommend 
this store is wonderful  as are sean and sister mary who work there  they are so warm and friendly  and i always am able to find great catholic books and items here at a great price  i recommend coming in with a good amount of time on your hands because there is so much to see  lots of hidden treasures   but i have also walked in and out of the store within a few minutes when i have come into the store with a specific item or book in mind  definitely worth a visit 
the service was fast and good  really enjoyed  the girl helped me work on my knots really well and give extra attention to my head when i get some headache  will def come back when im back to vegas 
menu selection disappointing  cob salad was good though  being named the adobe restaurant i expected a couple tex mex selections   nope  typical golf club restaurant   expected more from the biltmore   bummer 
the atmosphere of this place is awesome especially if you can get a seat outside to watch the bellagio water show  when visiting vegas this restaurant stayed packed  they have some featured drinks with dry ice  seemed cool but it was to early for me to try  i did have a mimosa and you can order unlimited mimosas for  23  my meal was the classic burger which was delicious  i rarely finish an entire burger and i was very close  my husband ordered a chicken sandwich and he seem to like it  the wait staff was friendly and attentive  this restaurant is good just a bit pricey 
wow  so nice and shiny inside   went to see the swell season here and they sang a couple of songs off mike and their voices carried very well through the entire theater    acoustically speaking  quite an accomplishment    no security guards  just little old ladys showing you to your seat  so i guess you could bum rush the stage and start a mosh pit if you really felt the need too   ill check the schedule and see what they have playing soon and then get a dressed up and act adult like for the evening    for a change   bad news  they they had only two bars with one server each for the whole event 
what you gonna do  its fast food  very basic and devoid of character   the only saving grace here is the communal salsa bar   sure fine  this place is alright  not disgusting or the best ever   just as average as you can get 
average  average  average    had a few beers and tried several others   all were fine but seemed watered down a bit   had a few apps and they were standard issue   meh   id rather go here than an olive garden  i guess thats the best way to sum up how i feel about this place 
yay for me  they open at 10 30am   service quick and helpful  owner  i think  was present and seemed to know quite a few of the regulars  i had the panko chicken with an egg roll  both were simple  yet above average  quite a selection for such a small place   all of the items i saw were pretty big or almost too big for a single serving   prices are a buck or two more than you might pay for at your average rice bowl shop  but its worth it   ill be back  soon 
dissapointed  again   i visited arabica with friends for lunch today  what a mistake   i knew it was under new management and they have a new selection  so i decided to try their hommous   my friends and i were shocked at the acidic taste it left in our mouths    i am middle eastern  so i know good  bad  and exceptable hommous    this was the worst i have ever had   i later noticed the date on the bottom of the package read 3  16   today is 3  25   the acidic taste was probably because the hommous was rancid   it makes me wonder what else they keep for so long and sell   additionally  it was overpriced   i wont be going there again 
good portion sizes and prices  i ordered the grilled chicken and it was amazing  nice and juicy on a bed of cabbage  their white rice is good too  overall  good experience  ill come back here again 
great french bistro in yorkville    delicious food  wine and fabulous outdoor patio   highly recd 
true italian restaurant with simple and fresh ingredients  i had guests with me that had a few allergies  they were more than accommodating and very gracious in surpassing my guests expectations in their meal selections   i have dined here four times this year  i truly believe that they have the best veal dishes in the city  chef valerio always takes the opportunity to check on his guests that are dining    i highly recommend the calamari in the spicy red sauce  request no breading on the calamari    the salads are simple and are served with very fresh ingredients   they do offer gluten free pastas for dinner    the 22oz long bone ribeye steak was perfectly seasoned    carry on valerios  i will be back for more 
i wanted to give this place a 1 star but since i didnt order steak i figured i wasnt getting the true experience  the place is decently set up  nice decor and ok atmosphere  the chairs at the tables are an atrocity in groups larger then 4 people  they dont scoot back  only swivel side to side    the worst part has to be the service  it was very slow to start  my friends have been to cut in l a  and they were surprised how lackluster the service was in comparison  the servers tend to like to shove themselves in between you and the people next to you  typically surprising you and brushing up against you   it was not acceptable  it made the meal continuously awkward   i got the sashimi tuna steak and was suprised to get roughly 3 4 slices of sashimi  about the size of a medium sushi piece   the outside was mostly seasoned with salt and the whole thing lacked any real flavor besides that   i understand the place is going to be pricey but i couldnt help thinking that i could have gone to an excellent sushi place and got great sashimi for half the price  so i guess take my opinion with a grain of salt since im the guy who orders fish at a steak restaurant and is supervised when its not too great 
all you people that gave bad reviews are crazy    the burgers here are amazing    ive been to vegas way too many times and i have to stop here and get a burger every time  i think the reason people dont like it is that they are used to the fancy  glittery restaurants that are dominating the strip  this place isnt really decorated  it kind of reminds me of a high school cafeteria   however the burgers are deliciousssss  who cares if they didnt waste time decorating  i didnt go there to look at the walls  i went there to eat    i personally think the prices are very reasonable  like what the hell  you arent gonna get a burger and fries for 8 dollars anywhere else on the strip   i love this place  cheap and greasy  i like it 
with pretty much every other club in vegas  as long as youre with a group of girls and youre dressed nicely  like ive said before nice for vegas   the shorter the dress the better   you should have a good time  ive been there 3 times and ive never had to pay the cover charge  walk up the strip during the day  youll easily get on the guestlist or get passes within 5 minutes  saturday night was fun  we got there early around 10 and got in immediately  the drinks are expensive  but pretty much standard prices for clubs in vegas  it was ok  my friends and i were already drunk before we got in there and the rest of our drinks were paid for by some random guys from south carolina  around 1 am it got really packed and i literally couldnt move one inch in any direction  however  i was drunk  i didnt care  i got drinks spilled on me more than once   however i was drunk  i didnt care  i almost got knocked over at least a dozen times   however i was drunk  i didnt care  the music was kind of out dated but i didnt mind  i was drunk  the outside upstairs area is really cool   you get an amazing view of the strip which is great for taking pictures if youre a tourist   its a cool club but if i had actually paid to get in i probably would have been disappointed  its definitely over rated but i had a good time  oh p s  sunday nights are dead  there was only about 15 people on the dance floor with us 
the fremont street flightlines were a great stop in vegas  and well needed on one of the hot and steamy nights that we were there    20 gets you suited up and taking flight down the infamous neon and led lined fremont street  after you pay downstairs  you go to a nearby elevator to the top of a parking garage and to a corner of it where you wait through a series of turnbacks  im sure the wait wasnt as long as we made it out to be  but when its 95 degrees at 8 30pm  you just want to get to where youre going and fast   once you get into the suiting area  the boys instruct you on how to suit up and you head up to the flight deck  if youre a guy and you get a tight feeling in the area down below  make sure you tell the boys at the suit up area  trust me  it only gets worse from here   at the flight deck  the zip line crew hooks you and your party up to their respective zip lines and then your stomach starts to sink   even i got a little nervous  and ive bungee jumped before   the flight down lasts a good 30 45 seconds  but its so much fun  the breeze is a great break from the baking desert sun   the crew offers photos of your journey via strategically placed cameras throughout your journey  i was hot and sweating throughout the ride  so i didnt want a hi def photo of that   but some people would   great attraction and id definitely do it again the next time im in downtown las vegas 
i thought the food was very tasty  but the portions are next to nil  im all about paying big bucks for a really good meal  but even for tapas style  this shit was way too expensive  but if you have the cash to spend  130 for food that does not fill you up but tastes really good  then this is the place for you  now we can say we tried it but probably wont be going back 
just another rave review for oscar and dealers choice  this place is amazing  like so many other reviewers oscar treated my car like it was his own  he and his expert staff did an incredible job on my vehicle and went way beyond what they needed to do   i had my car painted and the finish is impeccable  like it just rolled out of the showroom  but thats not all oscar did for me  he and his crew fixed and touched up a dozen items that werent required in the scope of the job  they just really want the work to exceed your expectations  think about that for a moment      these days who does more than they need to  dealers choice does  dont hesitate for an instant  call them or stop by  your car will love you  i wouldnt go anywhere else 
great quality ingredients with gourmet toppings that you would order at a nice restaurant or bistro  friendly and efficient service    they even gave us free spicy garlic dipping the sauce the first time i went  the complimentary kettlechips are better than the ordinary brands though probably not homemade    take out for a small pizza works out to be the best option as the pay by the slice section tends to be empty and you can get a fresh pizza in 20 mins  i like the abruzzo  spicy italian sausage  and the maple hawaiian has huge chunks of real pineapple not from the can  will def have to try the truffle pizza at some point 
it really is the size of a pocket  we wandered around koreatown looking for coffee on a late saturday afternoon when a dingy door with coffee pocket on it caught my eye    inside is a narrow little hipster box with only limited bar stools where you can get a perfectly sweetened vanilla latte with soy milk in a papercup  of course  to go   they also give you a tiny glass of water as a chaser for the espresso  the barista said they put two espresso shots in everything    closes early at 5pm even on a saturday 
horrible experience    we went here a couple of weeks ago  around 830 pm  and they made us wait to be seated when it was not even busy  ok  fine  after a 10 minute wait  the host sits us at a table that was not assigned to any wait staff at all   we ended up leaving  but before leaving  we spoke with the same host  and we were told a very blah  ok   he honestly seemed to not care  i called the manager  who confirmed we were sat at a table that was not assigned to anyone  and we were invited back to enjoy dinner on them  nice gesture  but when we returned the next week  the waiter we did get  was another blah person who did not seem to care  i was given 2 cracked straws  and to his reply   oh the come from the manufacture that way  no apology  and the food was just ok  with the many dining options out there  i will not be returning to this high school run restaurant 
this place is slow  whether theres a lot of people or a little bit of people  theyre very disorganized often making you hold your urine cup because they never have a designated place to put it and when they do  someone takes it away from the front  last time i was here i held my urine sample for 2 hours before it got tested   the way the hospital is set up is definitely a turn off  everyone unless youre brought in an ambulance sits in the same blue chairs once you go back to get your registration and blood drawn  it makes me want to burn my clothes when i get home knowing that people who came in with flu symptoms and people who came in with back pain are sitting in the same exact chairs  theres only two of them    honestly  i would never come to this place if it wasnt so close to my house and in a decent area 
quick service and hot food  they only offer kfc sides but luckily kfc sides are good so it wasnt a problem  you can only order inside the restaurant and it would have been nice if there had been some sign on the outside of the restaurant to indicate that before i got stuck in the drive through behind cars but the quality of the food and the customer service made up for it 
the eggs benedict are some of the best in town   there is never a wait  fast service  fresh squeezed oj  red velvet pancakes are ok but its hard to top babystacks  otherwise for a breakfast place this is a great spot that we always default to if there is a line somewhere else 
have to say we stopped in for a couple drinks and a few apps and we had a great time  our bartender renee was witty funny and engaging  she even put up w my buddys asinine jokes and made the whole experience even better  i ordered the scallops which were good  could of went w a larger or more scallops  they served 3 small ones but still good   the steak tartar was really good   the matzo balls wrapped in bacon were different and ok  but like i started off with renee made the place worth going back to and i will definitely bring my wife back to try their steaks
tourist trap   classic case of over promising   under delivering    sort of reflective of sections of tos upmarket    hype driven  dining establishments   food 1 5  5 how do you mediocritize tacos      even little tuck shops in liberty village like brunos do it way better  we tried 5 dishes  all were at best average or flavourless   service 2 5  5 have had better service at a sportschek    decor  4  5  value 1  5 when you are asked if youd like guacamole and chips as you sit down  chances are ppl are going to think it is complimentary  and definitely not expecting to be eventually charged 15  for a guacamole dip  sneaky  regardless  the quality of the food is not on par with the prices charged   would not have gone here if we were not already in the area for the christmas market   repeat  not even if this is the only place standing in a post apocalyptic toronto 
been here another two times  regardless of the lineups or the time of day  service is always friendly and helpful  food is fantastic  especially for the price   cant go wrong with anything  to date have tried 5 spice pork bun tacos  pulled pork  beef bao  fried chicken   everything is good to very good 
this is a review of their espresso bar inside galleria italia    ambience  4 5  5  food  3 75  5 everything served at the cafe is good   service  3 5  5  notes  great cafe  only issue is on weekends and during special exhibits it can get overcrowded with little room or privacy to catchup with friends  to access the espresso bar you will need to have either membership or purchased tickets    repeat  yes
great fun but overpriced  with all the great golf options locals are better to leave this track to the tourists 
one of my favorite courses to play in lad vegas  rtj jr  design 27 hole facility and always if great shape  the staff is friendly and the value is amazing  glad they are letting public play 7 days a week now  i hear they have good membership options as well 
loved my results  a great alternative to eyelash extensions  heather was professional and knowledgeable  i would definitely recommend heather to anyone i know 
theresa is perfection  from just brows  to wows  having just moved to town  finding the right person to do your brows is a daunting task  luckily for me  i found theresa   benefit brow bar   she didnt disappoint  she gave me amazing brows that were perfect   on point  go see theresa      shell make you look like a rock star 
one of the coolest bars in montreal  full of charming people  champaign and a good dj  we went on a saturday night and the bar had an upbeat  fun buzz  it makes sense that this bar makes all the  best of montreal  lists 
dinner   lunch  indian crepery   ambience  3  5 functional   clean    food  4 5  5  service  3  5  friendly   efficient  value  5  5  repeat  already did  probably the best in the city both in terms of quality and variety 
decor  ambience  4 5  5 cute  kitschy   cozy  comfortable in their skin  dont come across like theyre trying   service  3 5 friendly  americano   latte  2 5 3  5 youd walk into a non descript coffeshop in europe and get delish coffee  but not in north america   value  3  5
great presentation  friendly staff  baked stuff are nice  overall 3 5  5  bottom line  would not seek nadege out 
dinner  ordered  rib steak and salad   food  service ambience  4  5  value 3 5  5  repeat  not sure  notes  extensive wine list  setting is more like a saloon  parlor 
picked up caramel cake from here  it was amazing   many many hours later it was still moist and delicious  i had to be forcibly held back from devouring the entire cake     repeat  yes 
we had both the chicken and  spicey  pork options  and theyre delicious  though i like my broth thicker for the pork   service was prompt and helpful  ambience was warm  yet chic    repeat  yes  but unlikely on a weekday  when itll likely get crazy  
10  22  2011 was the date of our visit   food was just okay  server was just okay   the manager climbed up on the food prep counter to fix a light   we felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do   he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew   needless to say  lackluster service  mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will never return 
getting together with a girlfriend of mine involves nolen kitchen 9 times out of 10  why  its predictable  solid food  with a variety of drink and menu options  plus  theres a patio thats lovely in the summer and heated in the winter  count me in   i always order the zucchini chips and the country greek salad  every time  and usually some sort of relatively inexpensive wine  the zucchini chips alone are enough to send me in the direction of this location   parking is nothing short of nightmarish  and youll find yourself parking half a mile down the road  or across the street  illegally  mind you  just to enjoy dinner   service is top notch  ive never had an unpleasant experience 
what sends this local business aficionada back to a monster coffee chain again and again  you ask  simple  location  friendly staff and consistent menu options   im a fan of small  local business   the lone ranger against the corporate giants  but occasionally  i need to be able to walk to a coffee shop to meet with a friend or coworker  and this spot does the trick  no other coffee places are within a comfortable walking distance from where i live  and its proximity to the greenway is also a plus  grab a coffee  take a stroll   something to note  i think the new er  manager is making some good strides in giving the staff something to be proud of  id still like to see more customer interaction and less internal banter  sometimes its frustrating when they just keep talking to each other and griping about this or that   i must admit  though  you can always count on them to have the same things across the board  i appreciate their sampling of new products for you to try and many are quite tempting options   my favorite aspect of customer service to observe has been the free water situation  years back  they had a big cooler and small cups available for a self service water station for all the thirsty greenway walkers who didnt have enough sense to bring a water bottle or use a water fountain  then it disappeared for a while and they gave out cups of ice water to people who waited in line to ask for it  finally  theyve settled on a slender water bottle and small cups in a secondary location that makes water accessible for all  but in a classier way  its fantastic   i love the outdoor seating area  and have spent many hours out there  im also a fan of a few of the seasonal drinks offered  who isnt    i really appreciate the organic packaged convenience foods by the register  too  sometimes  despite its deliciousness  you just cant justify ordering a giant muffin or slice of cake 
you cant go wrong at woodlands  even if youre not of the vegetation persuasion   the menu is chock full of flavor and i defy you to leave anything other than stuffed to the gills with amazing food   a favorite of mine is the paper dosa  even if it sounds intimidating  you should order it  the sheer visual impact is enough to make it worthwhile   lots of chickpea dishes with splendid seasonings  id recommend ordering quite a few dishes and sharing with your dining party    naan  check  samosas  check  chana masala  check  everything else i havent tried  probably going to be awesome  too   make the drive out to woodlands  eat  eat and be merry      save the animals 
i chose salon piper glen because of its proximity to my home and have been incredibly impressed   since i called in desperate need of a haircut  i asked for the first available appointment  my stylist was lauren  and i adore her  she is super personable and connects well with clients  im a very simple person and so is my style  she understood that immediately and suggested   executed a no fuss hairstyle that i loved    they also incentivize first time customers with a sizable discount  and do the same for a couple of follow up appointments   prices are fairly low  considering that youre getting really high quality and service from the staff  less than i expected for a shampoo  cut   if you have been settling for unsatisfactory hairstyles because youre intimidated by a big salon  break up with great clips and give salon piper glen a try  you will leave feeling fantastic with a perfect style every time 
great food  great desserts    a variety of explosive flavors that blend well with their amazing sushi   lady gaga   bullets are my go to at all times   i highly recommend their ice cream   staff is very friendly and help explain menu 
friendly service   awesome friendly service   good food   not great but good food    i expected better but prices are not bad   too be honest your better deal on the strip than horrible casino prices    it wasnt like awesome sea bass but it was good   it wasnt like oh you got to go here but you wont be disappointed    its a far better option than say ceases or wynn restaurants    far better   go here over staying at casino restaurants 
this cafe is extremely frustrating  its a total gong show on the weekends and youll be very lucky to find a table  the staff can be pretty rude and really i cant blame them because they look so overworked and frazzled   as for the food   its not good  expect frozen chicken  iceberg lettuce  gravies and sauces from dry packages  basically anything you would think can be microwaved or deep fried quickly  i stick to the poutine when i am absolutely starved for food in high park and must have something  anything other than fries or a hot dog and you are asking for trouble  the prices are absurd for what you get   11 for a club sandwich   7 for a western  etc    the reason i say this cafe is frustrating is because high park is gorgeous and amazing  but why are we stuck with this awful  1970s truck stop style cafe and cuisine  its embarrassing for the city  im embarrassed to take visitors from out of town here and try to avoid it at all costs  i wish the city would let some food trucks into the park or let someone else take over the lease of the space  i cant believe the grenadier cafe still exists with this kind of food  and this service in 21st century toronto  and in the middle of one of the lovliest spots in the city no less 
unfortunately this business prefers making the  sale  over keeping the customer   they were paid for the service done today but lost a customer 
great nail salon  my favorite thing  though  is that they take appointments and respect them  your technician will be waiting when you arrive  ive gotten acrylics as well as pedicures  all the technicians are great  but deena is my favorite   
i love all the options available at this spa  red light therapy is so healing and there is no pressure by the staff to buy stuff  you can spend a couple of hours in this lovely place and enjoy the soothing energy as well as detox benefits of each station  the showers are clean  lockers are free  nice people good place 
very nice place with an old time feel to it  they have marilyn monroe and elvis pictures in the walls   service was quick  they have a nice sitting area outside but its quite small  they also have a water bowl for dogs outside so they get bonus points from me for being doggy friendly 
the view is the star at jekylls  with its perfect location overlooking the falls  but the food is also excellent  if a bit pricey  the happy hour is a good deal if you work anywhere near chagrin falls  with  5 sushi and pizzas  and decent deals on wine and cocktails  if you stilll play pokemon go  you can sit at the bar or patio and hit 2 3 pokestops plus catch tons of water pokemon    the bartenders are friendly and attentive  for dinner i recommend the scallops  which have always been cooked to perfection when ive had them  it is too bad that they are not open for lunch 
went here on a first date recently  it was a sunday night  we were seated promptly  i love asian food  and korean is one of my favorites  so i was really looking forward to trying seoul garden  happy to say  i was not disappointed     for starters  we had the ddaek bok gi  it is a favorite standard and this was as good as ive had  we also had a spicy tofu soup that was so satisfying on a chilly night    my date recommended the beef bbq  which he cooked for us on a grill they brought to our table  the first grill wasnt cooking properly  and the staff noticed immediately and replaced it without us even asking  the beef was thinly sliced and delicious  it is served with large lettuce leaves and rice to make wraps  the dipping sauces were excellent  i cant decide which i preferred  of course  we had an array of korean sides  and these were all very tasty as well  we also had the egg custard which was creamy and delicious   as a side note  the waiter was very polite  attentive  and adorably cute  i felt like we were in a kdrama restaurant scene  and they had cast an idol to be our server lol  he reminded me of baekyun from exo   sadly  our waiter claimed that he cannot sing  yes  i asked heehee   we drank quite a lot of soju  mostly because my dates friends  who happened to be there  dining too  thought it was cute to send it over to our table  so just know that if you get a bit too happy and decide to turn the parking lot into an outdoor dance floor with your car stereo blaring  someone will call the police   props to him though  he was cool and just asked us to take it somewhere else lol   so a fun date  and a great restaurant that i will visit again 
i like taco bell  i like kfc  i dont eat much fast food but these are the two i prefer  so i love that i can get both at one place  sadly the experience doesnt live up to the expectation    i would give this place more stars for the food  but both times ive visited  3 years ago  and this week   the service has been the absolute opposite of fast  i literally could have gone into a regular restaurant and ordered food and probably had it on the table faster than i got my food here at the drive through  no joke  i waited almost 20 minutes start to finish  and you cant get out of the line once you are in due to the layout  when i got to the window for my food  finally  i could see the same few people waiting in line inside  so it doesnt seem to matter where you order  you will be waiting a looooong time  id give the drive through zero stars except the girl at the window was actually very pleasant and apologetic  and she got my order right  everything was hot and fresh   if you go  i recommend the nashville sweet and spicy chicken  the coating kind of reminds me of sweet bbq potato chips with sriracha its actually quite hot  enough that my lips were slightly irritated  and i regularly eat and enjoy spicy food  korean  especially  as a reference  so f you dont like heat  you shouldnt try this    so two stars for the food and the window employee  if they had one of these anywhere else convenient  i would not go here due to the horrendously slow service 
i love this place   it has excellent food quality  atmosphere  and customer service  we ordered the jackpot chicken  rice for 2  baked mussels  winter melon soup  deep fried chicken skin and the coconut rum drink  everything was great  my favourite was actually rice which was very aromatic  light and fluffy   the seasoning was fantastic as well  its probably even better than some highly recommended places in singapore ive tried  my only dislike is the fried chicken skin tastes like its old ans definitely was not fresh   laura  our waitress was so welcoming and friendly   their coconut rum drink is served in an actual coconut and so refreshing and light  never thought coconut and rum would taste so good  in terms of atmosphere  it was very hipster and modern with great music  the lighting was a big dark for my liking but it was manageable   overall  i would highly recommend coming 
loved the service and variety of dishes  food was good quality and service was impeccable
made an appointment  got my confirmation  no call  no show and no one answers their phone number  thanks for making me wait around half the day just to have my phone not fixed     terrible 
decided on this location because it seemed like all the others had equally bad reviews and this one was close  i had a gift card i needed to use so went for a drink and appetizers  interesting place     the staff was friendly enough but seemed clueless when it came to customer service  our waitress commented on how cute my children were  when she finally figured out we were in her section  and then went into a long story about her own kids    forgot to provide us with plates to dish up the appetizers  the bahamas mama drink was really good    the appetizers were not  if you go in expecting unhealthy  over processed  greasy bar type food you will not be disappointed  i would recommend this place for happy hour 
love this place  great ambience  food and service  the sandwiches and posole are incredible  live music on the weekends make this a great place for brunch  drink menu has a good variety  restaurant feels spacious  had my small kids with me and didnt feel totally packed in like we were invading other diners space 
i love sitting outdoors on their patio during nice weather  the staff are friendly and efficient     constantly monitoring for empty water glasses and empty plates to take away  the waiters use a  team effort  approach  everyone watches and helps every table  there is no specific server for each area  pizza and salads use quality ingredients  always taste fresh  the brussels sprout pizza is my favorite  try the lunch  salad combo for around  12  its the perfect amount for lunch 
boyfriend got a gift card here so we decided to go  weve both been before  but never really had the desire to come back at any point    service was very strange and awkward  walked in and got a strange vibe  barely friendly  very much to the point   have you picked the entrees you want    our server had lots of facial hair and we would watch him touch his beard and put chapstick on in the back  but never saw him wash his hands  that grossed us out   the food wasnt bad  we both ended up full but its definitely not authentic chinese  i remember coming here after a trip to china and having been disappointed i never came back  either way it filled us up but it wasnt anything special   i feel like this place tries so hard to pass off as elegant and what not  but i just wasnt getting that from this experience  hardly friendly people  without good sanitation practices  with over priced entrees that you could somewhere else with larger portions for a cheaper price     safe to say my boyfriend and i left disappointed and agreed that we wouldnt ever come back  i dont get why other people would get so excited about coming here  nothing special 
i wish i could give this place 0 stars  do not buy from this place  hands down this was the most stressful day of my life  i love my car  but wow  i will never refer anyone to buy from camelback kia 
food was absolutely delicious   my friends had the falafel pita and i had the chicken kabob pita with a side of spicy potatoes  the wait staff was nice and the decor was clean  zetas is a hidden gem in the west valley 
tina is the new owner of this salon   its beautiful  she does fantastic work   she really cares about high quality  go see them soon  youll quickly become a regular   tina has been doing my nails for a year now   i refuse to go to anyone else  it can be so difficult to find someone whos concerned about taking care of people rather than the  turn   burn  attitude  but tina is amazing  and my nails look phenomenal every time   dont be swayed by any reviews older than 2 months  those are about the previous owners  give tina a chance   youll have found your new favorite nail salon 
this place is such a pile of shit  went in there for a friends birthday and the funny guy bartender pored him a shot of food coloring that stained his teeth for the rest of the night  it was kinda funny but only if he had it coming   and he didnt  at the other end of the bar  the dump truck fat ass of a bartender carded us and i practically needed my mothers maiden name to get a damn drink  the people in there were clearly over served  some drunk chicks were making out on a table  crashed to the ground  and broke it  the bartenders didnt do anything because that was the most pussy theyve seen in their pathetic lives  to end the night my friend almost got in a fight with the karaoke host for skipping him so he can sing a rap song to a bunch of blacked out chicks to lure in his nightly date rape    check this place out to see if you like it  even though you will most likely want to torch it or shit on the ground as you leave       steer clear from this
if youre not near chinatown  this place is a good replacement if  you dont mind sitting on your neighbors lap dirty tables in abundance service is slow  unfriendly  and sometimes wrong  but  it serves the purpose  next to yogurtland so you can get a delightful treat afterwards 
i think their services have been improved  cox their staff were really nice  and the food is really good  better than other usual fast food 
we came in with a party of 9  7 kids  we waited 15 minutes so we asked for fries while we waited for food  they did not bring any  we had to ask for campfire three times  no one checked on us for refills  i had to get up to ask for the check  we were there a total of two hours and they were not busy  but they had plenty of help to gather in the kitchen and talk  this is the fifth visit and none were good  so sad  go across the street to mod or cafe rio 
so cool  a few of the machines ate my money but other than that it was so awesome  there are machines from the 60s  present day  and all the years between  maybe even some earlier  a cheap getaway if you need a break from all the commotion on the strip  they even have an old pac man and donkey kong machine  the older machines only cost a quarter to play     this museum also houses the last working penny gum ball machine  worth the visit 
very interesting place to visit  we got the groupon deal so it was much cheaper than buying tickets at the door  it was a little more interactive than i would have liked and i was a tad freaked out  in the last room there are loud gunshot noises and crazy lights which i wasnt a fan of  however  there is a great deal of historical artifacts and pieces which were very cool to see  plan on a couple of hours to visit because its a huge place 
driving in from the south  the imposing dome of st  josephs is visible from 20 km out   the first visual confirmation that youre getting close to montreal  for a tourist  this hulking presence is almost impossible to resist  and all the guidebooks confirm that the church is a top 10 attraction  so of course you make time for a visit    as you pull into the parking lot  picking your way through tour buses packed with pilgrims  youre struck again by the sheer mass of the building perched atop one of the highest points in the city  as you climb the interminable stairs up the side of the mountain  you start to anticipate the architectural beauties that await you at the summit  several hundred calories later  you finally enter the sanctuary  ready for a payoff that never really comes    turns out the oohs and ahs of st  josephs are mostly generated down below  at the top  the views are endless  but not especially awe inspiring  because youre looking away from the montreal skyline  and the inside of the church is nearly spartan in its simplicity  with very little to distract your eye from the huge dome overhead  what little effort is made at decoration tends toward a monochromatic  slightly depressing style with a nod to chagall 
not sure why people are giving this place less than 3 stars      just tried this place out on nye and it was pretty good in my mind  although the wait was a bit irritating since we had a party of 6  but not much to blabble about    service was great  waitress  hostess  even the manager were all friendly    food in my opinion was nothing less expected from gr    ordered the euro burger  rare  and the truffle parmesan fries    both were amazing  burger was cooked to my order  the fries were dericious  when they were still hot  the 2 sauces  truffle aioli   ketchup  that came with the fries made my taste buds go insane  i especially liked the in house kitchen ketchup  it had a sweet flavoring to it    overall  i would recommend this place for people visiting vegas to at least try it out   will definitely come back and do another review after trying more of their menu  
we got the  22 ayce and it was decent  the server had problems understanding our orders though  we had to tell her a few times  for the  22 you can only order the first 2 items once  i say go to tofu hut 
my shellac peeled and chipped within four days   it was a french mani and though the colour and shape were fine the white line was just okay   i went back and they fixed four nails but the nails started to peel again within two days   i have had regular manicures last longer   the girls have no personality and some are very inexperienced 
when i go to daves  i go because its convenient   i would much rather shop elsewhere  but when time is short  i usually go   the prices are not that great and the brands are limited   i am especially disappointed in their produce  i have never had so many vegetables and fruits go bad so quickly  as the ones i buy from daves  no bueno   i got some glazed donuts for a meeting once  and by the time i had gotten home  the glaze had liquified and the donuts were disgusting  stay away from their baked stuff  on top of that  the stuff they have is very expensive   hi price and low quality do not sit well with me   the staff is always friendly though  and are helpful if the need arises   in the end  id rather shop at zagaras  but i usually dont have time   only go to daves if you really need something and cant go anywhere else 
this place is so authentic   i cannot express enough how happy i am that we have a place like this nestled in downtown champaign   my husband and i are instant fans 
i came here a few times with my friend after buying a groupon deal   we mostly took zumba with a certain instructor every time who was really good   we tried a different day with a different instructor and the instructor i am sorry to say  was terrible  didnt talk to us or explain anything during class  was off beat the whole time  stayed on one side of the room instead of the middle  faced us vs  facing away so we could copy her  and the movements lacked energy and enthusiasm  and werent even done full out   if i wasnt there with my friend  i would have walked out  no one should have to pay for that  service     also  there is one front desk check in person that is not friendly or inviting at all   we walk in the door and are literally inches from her  signing in  and there is no  hello  or anything  yet when its someone she knows  its miss chatty cathy seems very cliquey there  then on our way out  me liking to thank a business for providing a service to me  says  bye  thank you  right at her  and absolutely no response  very unwelcoming    i have more classes to use for my groupon  but might not use them at all 
i am growing extremely tired of hearing  golden turtle  and  best pho in the city  together in the same sentence  the pho   gt is good  but not excellent  nor is it near the best in the city   after coming across an article this morning whereby seamus oregan claimed gt was the best in the city and that he had eaten pho in vietnam  i decided to give gt another chance after a couple subpar experiences  overall my bowl with rare beef and well done flank was ok and nothing more  i like how it arrived approximately 120 seconds after i had placed the order  but there was nothing else to remember   for me the  1 trait a bowl should be judged on is the broth above evrerything else  unfortunately gts is seriously lacking that kick  punch and jab that a solid bowl should have  the portions are good and the service is prompt  but it is not the best pho in the city   pho tien thanh down the road has my vote as the best in the city and once you try the broth there you wont eat pho anywhere else  ive eaten pho all over toronto  richmond hill  markham  mississauga and waterloo and ptts broth is boss  its clear  succulent  spiced just right and gives me weekly withdrawl  in fact  i know where im going for dinner 
this 5 star review is based on the turkey   bacon club at the hot spot  this sandwich is one of my go to  slayer meals  when im at school and prepared to eat a meal for 2    i eat this sandwich so often i only have to show up at the door and the sweet chef will begin toasting the bread for me    were looking at 3 whole wheat pieces of toast spread with mayo  a stack of sliced turkey breast  tomatoes  hot peppers  lettuce and five strips of bacon  the amount of bacon in this sandwich is perfect  you get a crispy piece with every single bite  it is so damn satisfying i have gotten at least ten of my friends on to it    now  dont go there and order a bacon and egg sandwich  which is killer btw  or some chicken salad wrap and msg me and tell me that its not 5 star worthy  read the first line of this review and then comment    five strips of bacon   this sandwich is perfect  yah i said it 
hit church sunday night for the first time in a little while and was not disappointed by any means  prior to hitting it up i attended the beats ahoy boat cruise which was amazing  and reign where addys b day celebrations were rampant    no matter where i go hover  nothing quite compares to zone  the quality of music is always so good that i really question why i go anywhere else    i got there in time to see arguably my fav dj carlio smash it  followed by kabuto of costa ricas prized kabuto   koji  who equally smashed it  it appears to me that zone is entertaining more and more international djs these days which says a lot for the venue    any haters must be deaf  or there simply going there for the wrong reasons    there is no place like zone 
soooo i began cheating on veronica roughly one year ago as i started to get my hair cut by random hairdressers in richmond hill  much closer to  home  truth be told my hair was never the same  a few months ago i returned to veronica and low and behold the top of my head began looking proper again    when i first wrote my review on veronica from the barbers chair i mentioned that shes always booked up and you have to book her at least a few days in advance  now  id say shes even busier and still the quality of her work has not decreased one bit    thanks v 
i love everything about apple  especially their customer service   long story short  my g  fs iphone was acting up on her  her text messages were coming in hours late  she was getting tons of dropped calls and you could barely hear her if you were on the line with her  as her warranty was ending 12  12  09 she decided to get it looked at asap    her appt was for last saturday at 3 50pm at the yorkdale apple store  due to some unexpected traffic we ended up getting there by roughly 4 15pm  although the store was packed we managed to see a rep right away at the genius bar  withing minutes the problem was detected and she got a brand new iphone right away    the rep was very knowledgeable  courteous and offered some advice to my g  f  more than anything i was amazed at how efficient and smooth the whole experience was  apple has incredible products and incredible customer servicce  no wonder they are doing so well 
by far  my favorite mexican restaurant  their chips and salsa are great  drinks are great  food is great  and service is great 
good food is good and the service matches it  friendly and attentive wait staff  food was fresh and the staff seemed very open to customizing it a bit  came here for dinner and would certainly go back    my only slight disappointment is their pita bread but not a big deal at all 
burritos are incredible  both breakfast and lunch  you absolutely cant beat the prices for the quality of food  best mexican ive had in arizona  the service is pretty basic but very quick  do yourself a favor and some some homemade tortillas home with you 
what a  great experience    after car wash  i lost one of car part  and the manager said i may put some glue in order to not get lost next time 
terrible grooming service  8 hours after dropping my dogs off only to find their haircuts poorly done  unevenly cut  ears not cleaned nails not trimmed  when i asked why werent the ears cleaned they replied its only upon request  really   i will never bring my dogs here again 
carpet monkey came and cleaned my carpet yesterday morning  what a fantastic job   super nice and friendly people also  my carpets look almost new again  would definitely use them again 
i ordered teppanyaki grilled tuna   shrimp marinated in coconut milk   fresh herbs w   miso soup  salad  veggies   steamed rice  21 95  this was way over priced   this plate was not freshly cooked and the veggies were not fresh as the carrots were so soft  the miso soup was not hot  my friend ordered the seafood noodle soup  13 95   the soup was warm it had artificial crabmeat  it had very fishy taste  everything just tasted like we were eating left over food  if you want this type of food i would recommend sake express 
tried the burritos hoping it was better than the last one i went to  it was a little better but not authentic enough  the steak was not cooked fresh  it seemed as if it was cooked earlier today and was reheated  this is probably why they served it so quick  they poured too much cheese over the burrito  we asked for guacamole and we got slices of avocado  they do not have unsweetened tea  the waitress was new and was friendly  according to the pictures i see here in yelp looks pretty good like the tacos  ill probably give a second chance and try a different order  coming from california its just ive had great mexican food and ive been to a lot of them 
very upset   asked for my nails to be done a certain way  should have asked for the guy i knew could have done them correctly  the guy that was doing them cut the first tip correctly but after that they were all different  even the same nail the sides didnt match  they were not busy at all so shouldnt be due to being in a hurry  i told him to stop and i wanted the tips removed due to not being what i asked for and not even matching  he refused so i asked for the guy i knew who could do what i wanted  he was upset by this but got the other guy  told him i wanted the nail tips removed  only tips had been put on at this point   he said he could fit without removing i said i dont see how he could make the shape i wanted with the way it was cut but said he could with the power  refusing to remove the tips as well  i didnt want to leave without nails so let him finish them  he did make the shape the same on all of them but like i said couldnt make the correct shape due to the first guy cutting them wrong  so  i told him just to paint all the same color instead of what i had first wanted due to the fact i dont see me leaving them on even a week why pay more for designs when i hate the nails  i need to let my nail beds heal before taking them off and a new set put on or i would already be breaking them off    i hate hate hate the shape they are  i know some may like that shape  the guy trying the fix said he liked it better but they are my nails and i have to like them  for the 1st time in 20yrs of getting my nails done i didnt leave a tip and im leaving a neg review    i will never go back to this shop and would advise anyone who likes to have a say in the way their nails look dont go either as they dont care what you like only getting you in and out even when no one else is there   
great service  great staff  i wanted to get some good hubcaps for a good value and didnt want to be sold on expensive hubcaps  they offered me exactly what i was looking for and got me setup with new hubcaps for  50 for all four  this included them putting them on for me and shining them  dont go anywhere else 
found this company here on yelp  great communication  fair price and super fast clean up  communicated mainly by text which is more convenient for me since i work a lot  the guys were very polite  showed up exactly on time and did an amazing job on my backyard  i had over grown trees  bushes  weeds and a lot of dead leaves on the ground  my backyard really needed some tlc  very happy i found this company and will use  recommend them in the future 
was here judging the world food championships and several other judges told me to go have a slice here and i would love it  boy  they werent kidding   im a pizza snob for sure  born in ny and raised in la  but mostly only had great pizza in ny  there are actually a few good places here in sd too    but that slice i got from here was off the charts good  even though the toppings were great  the crust was the star  crispy  yet chewy with a slightly sweet flavor that just made all the toppings pop    i got it topped with purple potatoes  prosciutto  feta and pesto  wowza  even loved the taste of the oils running all over it  yes   6 is a lot for one slice  but it was totally worth it  the pepperoni and cheese is only  4  i just went with fancy schmancy    i will def be back next time im here 
stumbled upon this place while tooling around the freemont experience  good stumble    i only had a salad with golden beets and feta on it  but it was delish with that orange vinaigrette on it  yumm   i wish i had more time to come back here  but def will in the future  the owners son was so nice   and cute 
las vegas is an amazing food city  you almost cant go wrong with picking a restaurant here  thomas keller is one of my favorite chefs  but thats not why i give bouchon 5 stars   so i used to live in las vegas  and as a matter of fact  i worked inside the venetian so this place was very close and convenient  i loved popping in for a quick lunch or meeting friends later in the day for a nice dinner  oh i miss you bouchon   bouchon is what i imagine a typical french bistro to look and feel like  simple items on the menu  done right  steak with fries  pan roasted trout  blood sausage  etc  everything delicious    excellent staff  very friendly and accommodating  the restaurant itself is simple in design  however not so simple in workmanship  the details are just right  coming together and creating an incredible atmosphere and ambiance    if youre in vegas  treat yourself and have dinner here  you wont be disappointed  however  make reservations   now for some really exciting news  there is to be a bouchon soon in beverly hills  woooohoooo 
gordon ramsay has several restaurants in vegas  but by vegas standards  this one is probably my least favorite   i say vegas standards  because  in my opinion  you can be more discerning here  there are just so many fantastic restaurants here  and theyre all pretty much walking distance from one another   ive been here twice now  this last time  i was here for a convention  and actually favored going to mesa grill  however  the wait was ridiculous  so gordon ramsay pub   grill it was   i digress  onto the food   ive had their grilled beef burger as well as their grilled lamb burger  my issue with their burgers is mostly their bun  it could stand being a bit more fresh  its on the drier  crumbly side  maybe people just dont order enough burgers here  so their bread doesnt move as fast  for a burger at the  20 mark  it should pretty much be flawless  their fries are good  and the patties themselves are great   for a much  much better overall burger  go to gordon ramsay burgr  located inside planet hollywood   service is spot on  and the interior looks great   food  2 ambience  5 service  5 value  2
i cant stop craving it  the atmosphere is great  the food is delicious  and the wait staff is friendly and helpful  very prompt service even though they were really busy and have only been open a week  i cant wait to go back 
the service and servers here are a mess  ive been here late night about a handful of times and enjoyed myself  this recent visit was unfortunately  the worst service i ever had in my life   my friend and i decided to stop by park after running the glow run  we went to the back patio and sat at a table  there was one server and one busser running around  the server never came by so we had to wave her down  she rolled her eyes and annoyingly asked  yes   ok  i understand there is only one of you but i am a paying customer  i couldnt believe she said that  we ordered with her anyway because we were starving after that 5k  15 minutes passed   25 mins   nothing came out and we havent seen the server since  we stopped the busser and told him that weve been waiting and he took our order again  again  another 20 minutes passed it just wasnt worth it to wait  i will never come here again  they should have been adequately staffed for a busy night and hire friendlier people 
looking for the best time in vegas without any hassle  tavo is definitely your guy  i was recommended to him from a friend to get into marquee one night when it opened three years ago  i have always gone through tavo ever since  not only is he professional and reliable  he is super friendly and makes sure that you have a great time  i feel like a vip every single time  i am not bias because we did become great friends over the years  i also work in the hotel industry and trust me  no other host can top tavo and his service  he responds quickly and makes booking tables for day clubs and night clubs easy    with that said  go and party your butts off 
went here on a tuesday evening  it wasnt busy and we were seated right away  the staff was very kind  attentive  and knowledgeable of their beer options  i got the fish and chips  my friend got some sort of chicken sandwich and both were excellent  it wasnt too loud  price was good  friendly staff  would definitely return 
so i wrote to days inns corporate office to get this figured out before i wrote a bad review  they said they would look into it  three weeks have passed and ive heard nothing  so here we go   the pool was closed the entire time my mother stayed at this hotel because the city shut it down for what im assuming was poor maintenance resulting in a dangerous pool  my mother is disabled and cant drive on her own  so she was stuck in her room for two entire weeks without even a spot to sit and read by the pool  unacceptable   the people who work in the office were so unbelievably rude and badly trained  it was like pulling teeth coming down there asking for coffee    rooms were disgusting  housekeepers didnt keep it clean either  dead baby roaches  grimy sinks and tub  never got towels or coffee or other amenities like changed sheets without asking  when they did change the sheets  they didnt put a fitted sheet on the bed    you really expect anyone to lie on a bare mattress in a dirty hotel    no thanks   honestly if we got an apology for the service there or at least a freakin response from days inn about it  i wouldnt have ripped this place  unfortunately  days inn as a company seems to just not care about their customers 
great food owner and waiter are sooo nice    try the curry tofu and crab puffs 
ok ive been a loyal oliveos fan since i moved to tempe    never had an issue  but the last 2 times i ordered delivery from here i was given dry crumbly pita bread  sides of hummus that were in containers not properly closed and got on everything else  greek fries that were stale  not even exaggerating  they tasted like day old fries from the fridge   delivery dudes were usually cool but lately theyve been so bitchy and just kind of throw the food at me and bounce  ive always tipped them well too  the only perk to this place is that whenever i order  always weekdays  theyre very fast  but id like to have food that isnt gross    might as well go to haji baba instead  way better service and food 
staff here has been sweet and helpful to me   so far    havent run into any especially terrible members here  its either full of asu girls or elderly couples  if you get a membership  be sure to ask for their peak hours chart    it has been a lifesaver  they have a lot of cardio equipment that there will never be a shortage of even at their busiest times but their strength training equipment  barbells  dumbells  machines  etc  are few and far between and its a good idea to go when theres not people hogging that area  everythings sparkling clean  no judgmental atmosphere  its actually a pretty cool gym  and everythings purple  also plenty of bike racks outside  and its right by health food places like sprouts and thrive  acai bowls 
my garage door was a old  loud and falling apart   joey came out right away and recommended a door and opener that was reasonable and updated   it needed a few adjustments after installation because of the position of my house and how the sun hits and i recieved a call back immediately to get it resolved   professional and efficient service  thank you 
unbelievable javier kyle jeff were absolutely wonderful   absolutely best moving experience ever   they showed up promptly at 7am clean happy and ready to work   i mediatly i noticed that they were non smokers  they didnt smell bad and didnt take smoke breaks which is important because we were paying hourly  also young and in good shape and never stopped moving  this crew was very careful with our possessions   they worked constantly never complained and were concerned that they were doing everything in their power to make our move as stress free as possible  examples  disconnected and reconnected washer and dryer disassembled and assembled granddaughters crib even removed and replace closet doors to allow large item to be installed in closet   exceeded expectations not only of movers but also best service of any service industry company in memory   belive it
public areas were nice and spacious  pools were sparkling but it was too hot to use the pool  113   rooms were large  however the air conditioning unit was loud and blew so hard that the curtain was constantly flying    pros the staff was friendly and accommodating  jds had good food and not just limited to fried bar food     cons having to drive past their laundry facility and trash area to get to the rooms  their breakfast buffet was really limited but our server was so much fun we didnt care 
we love the pizza here  being from nj  ny ourselves it is definitely high quality food  the pizza sauce is what stands out the most  it is absolutely delicious  they also make a great calzone  the only downside is it is definitely a little pricey for a pizza place  but we are never disappointed when we order from here 
best workouts i have ever had   the results are amazing and i couldnt feel better   
i usually stay at courtyards while on business  however the one across the street had inflated rates due to being close to capacity so i booked at this springhill  i have stayed in a few other springhills locations that seemed a little nicer than this location  this one wasnt too bad  my main complaint is the bed  mattress  it was pretty uncomfortable and i didnt get a good nights rest  both myself and my husband woke up with sore backs  not sure if it just happened to be an older mattress in that particular hotel room or if all beds are like this throughout the hotel  i have slept on air mattresses more comfortable than this hotel bed 
my tattoo is so rad  thanks for this custom piece  joeyhamiltontattoo at  revolttattoos  afrotattoo  afropuffs  nappyfro  curls  inked
this is a food review site  but let me rant on zzeeks as a local business    1   local family owned business   first and foremost  im a huge proponent of supporting local business and community  and when i have an opportunity to buy locally rather than a chain  im going to do so   in our little cul de sac of ahwatukee  there are several great restaurant options but jodi and zesty zzeeks stands out from the rest      2    supports local community   almost every other week  jodi is doing something to support the local community  whether its fundraising night or charity causes   my sons boyscout troop holds events here  and my daughters dance company friends always stop by before they begin dance class   jodi and her staff is always there  with smiles and zzapoles      3    customer service   ive seen zzeeks engage with the community when it comes to their food and customer service   they reach out on social media  and they correspond on their reviews   when i say  they   its the owners who do that  because they truly care about the food they make   this speaks volumes for any small business owner that puts the time and effort to engage with their customers and community      4   food  ive got young kids   a cheese pizza will suffice   but for my snobby foodie tastebuds  totally kidding   id highly recommend the hawaiian pizza and margherita pizzas   they are my go to   ive ordered for delivery  and they show up on time  professionally and the pizzas are in tact  still hot   we just hosted a party this past weekend  ordered 3 20  for a group of 40 people  and it ran out quick   i even had to order a second batch   fan favorite all around     thanks you zesty zzeeks         
horrible customer experience   situation  im calling during a lunch rush  which i understand it is a busy time   im placing a big order for a party my family is hosting   the lady on the phone was not polite at all   at first  she kept asking my name  when im trying to ask a question   at one point she was being super aggressive in asking my name  when i simply wanted to let her know i wasnt picking it up until 330pm   i called her out that she was being impolite  and she rudely told me that she has a  line out of the door and im asking a million questions    i asked one  can i have this ready for later pickup   of course she didnt hear that bc she wanted to be a robot and just get my name first     point is  1   you cant treat customers   on phone or onsite  yes ive ordered a lot from you guys over the past few years  like that  ever  2   i understand i was calling during busy hours  but it makes no difference   i was a recurring customer looking to place an order  even though if it was for later pickup    update  looking at reviews  it seems like the manager is pretty consistent on how she treats her customers   that sucks 
maggie devine is devine   she got my hair color perfectly and the cut was fresh but not overkill   she really listened to what i was looking for and is an incredible human being 
packed and flavorful sandwiches   awesome cookies   owners are down to earth and if this place was in a more populated area  it would be slammed non stop 
beautiful sushi  classy ambience and service was good   pricey  but it should be given the quality of food 
great coffee  baked goods  and breakfast to go catch up with a friend   little gift shop on the grab and go side is cute 
fantastic service from sid and delicious coffee   vibe is very cheery and a really nice addition to old town   have to try there waffle on my next visit  everything is made from scratch and a very simplistic but fresh and delicious menu   thank you for such a great start to my friday 
ordered twice from there  the food is  in all honesty  disgusting  i had fish and chips  and poutine  i was astonished that the poutine was subpar  i mean  come on  how can you mess up quebecs national dish so badly  as for the fish and chips  the fries were decent  while the fish itself was not very tasty 
slow service  their skewers are smaller than other restaurants  and the price is similar  therefore you are actually paying the premium price  food was just soso  i guess a big part of my bill goes to their yonge finch rent instead of the food 
this is the worst place ever to get ur nails done i repeat do not go total waste of money the ppl are rude    i went for manicure  gel on my nails yesterday  first the lady didnt even clean my nails  soak in warm water  scrub etc   then i notice she didnt evn clean up my cuticles right nor did she evn get under my nails for the dirt  once she put the gel on she made it super clumpy and had the nerve to tell me that she was done after she clearly can see the dents and bumps  i can tell she got mad when i told her something  so another older man came amd said hed fix it  he was soo rough filing the top of my nail to remove the gel he cut my cuticles the lady did not get the first time he was in such a rush didnt paint them right  next day my nails cracked  it was such a horrible experience  ive been to cheaper places that do such a way better job and actually care about their work  this place was definitly not one of them  they just want your money   i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone   if i could zero stars   worst nail experience ever hands down 
this is a must have for every trip we make to vegas   hubby and i shared the alaskan white chowder and the combo pan roast    omg so tasty   first of all    neither of us eat like birds and it was plenty of food with out fighting over the tasty tidbits either   i love that everything is cooked right in front of you and it seems so simple   i highly recommend the pan roast and the chowder   we had spice level of 4 and it was just right to give me the sniffles but still really enjoy   get there right at 11am when they open if you dont want to wait in line    there are only 13 seats  period   but if you do have to wait    let me assure you it is worth it 
prior to seeing  o  that evening  my mom had put in her vote for a  steakhouse   and left us to decide between fix and prime  after browsing through a few reviews  in addition to reading through the menu  we decided on prime  the restaurant itself is absolutely stunning  and the front row seats to the fountains  both indoor and out  certainly didnt hurt  the waitstaff was out of this world   attentive  humorous  and knowledgeable  ask for howard  you wont be disappointed   cocktails were perfectly balanced  and dangerously delicious  their gluten free menu was extensive  and howard made sure every side that could be made gf was  as well as oversaw the plating to ensure neither my mom nor i got sick  i dont believe there is a bad dish on the menu  from the colorado lamb to the filet mignon  the steak tartare was divine  and both the truffle mashed potatoes and ginger sweet potatoes were out of this world   while certainly not a restaurant we will return to daily  this will absolutely be our go to spot for special occasions 
i cant say enough about j2 cleaning  they were incredibly responsive  and were able to schedule me within 48 hours  even offered to  hop the sensor in the garage  to ensure the house remained locked after their departure  the carpets were impeccable  after a year of a black great dane rolling and drooling all over  there was no sign anywhere that a pet had lived in the home  i will definitely be using them in the future  and cannot recommend them enough   i cant wait to see what they do with my cream sofas which have been my dogs favorite for years

good drinks nice clean atmosphere but i have to say scattered ass everywhere sad thing is its young teenagers with shorts that dont cover anything and groups of girls shaking their ass when u have children and families trying to have a good time where they spend their hard working money  sadly there should be a dress code to the point where its respectful for the person and others    sad to say their parents dont know they dress like this    but for the most part its decent
this place is okay    but i tell you one thing the staff there is really rude and customer service is not one of their strong suits  and heavens forbid you dont understand their consignment hours especially in the weekends they will have ur head on a platter i think i thrill found the queen of hearts there and she will be off with ur head   lol  i would go to the ray and the 1 10 location best 
the black bean  plantain empanadas are so yummy   and they have great vegetarian options 
older of the hotels  and you can tell from the smell  appearance and lack of presentation  not a lot of restaurants to choose from  aside from that the employees are very friendly 
chickachanga  unique yum  you must try this  you just think it and you want one  perfect service delicious food quality ingredients  potatoes super yum the toast is super yum  try otro restaurant too  yum     pancakes
safer to go to target instead  if you value your life  at entrance i feel like im walking through a prison yard  gauntlet  why does wm allow loitering   felon types  tweekers   drug addicts  beggers just hang there all day   evening  go home  go to park after you buy or after you piss on the sidewalk     wm do something   stop hiring an 89 year old to drive security  hire a young vet who means business  why do i constantly have to be hit up by beggars for money   goodbye imbecile we dont give a damn mgmnt  forget you   your ridiculous store  im shopping at target  started last night boycotting you  at target for baking soda ended buying vacuum cleaner  dress  p s  your employees are wonderful but its just not worth jeopardizing my life  and god bless all the broken  homeless  felons  tweekers but walmart is not the prison yard  welfare office  park bench  fire hydrant  drug alley   its a store period       goodbye walmart 
just sat in the drive through for 10 minutes waiting to order with no one here because the only two employees here didnt want to work  so may mcdonalds these days drive the extra two minutes to the next one 
went here as part of a party of four  service was slow  general tsos chicken and orange chicken were burned  teriyaki chicken was too sweet  will not be returning to this restaurant 
lets pretend  lets pretend its a world of no answers  only questions   are stylists supposed to have anything in the way of people skills  do customers have any say in the phoenix of 2015  if its a bad experience what happens if im un pc enough to not automatically assume its all me 
such a cute little diner  me and my boyfriend stoped in cause we had never been there before we were both pleasently suprised  great food nice waiting staff at a decent price  will for sure be back  
we stayed here while boating on lake mead  the staff is friendly and helpful  our room was a mini suite and was roomy  the house keeping staff did a great job and kept our room spotless  the food was ok  nothing too exciting but when we had a complaint at one of the restaurants the asst  manager took care if it quickly and hassle free  the movie theater is awesome  power recliner seats and you reserve your seat as well  were coming back
after reading countless reviews and curious to try haggis i finally made it here and was not disappointed  started with the taste of scotland and fried pickles which arent to be missed  main was the haggis which again was fantastic  great food  welcoming staff and overall fantastic atmosphere makes this a destination not to be missed 
my preferred location  plenty of parking  large store  wide aisles  quick checkout and garden centre always has something of interest   on the negative often common items are sold out  their car service centre will get the job done but expect to wait   store service is non existent  but thats to be expected after all this is a canadian tire 
made reservations and visited tonight with a group of 14  not 1 enjoyed their meal  after ordering we waiting 1 hour and 50 minutes for our food  what we got was an assortment of over cooked meals  when i say over cooked i mean the pork was jerky status   others had the steak which looked at though it had been microwaved and tasted freezer burned  the salad was drowned in vinegar and the clams were cold with a gelatine like sauce over them  all of our complaints were dismissed with apologies from the inattentive waitress   needless to say i confident that no one from our group will be giving this place a 2nd chance 
after reading some great things about this place  myself and my boyfriend  including a couple of friends  decided to check it out one sunday afternoon  im also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future  so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research    it being a busy afternoon  we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated  one drawback to this place was the size of the hallway  with people ahead of us already waiting  we had no choice but to wait out in the rain   the layout is very long and narrow  with a simple brick wall  very few artwork on the wall though  i saw one in the corner  so nothing to catch your eye while youre waiting for your meal  although the bar was neat to gaze at    once seated  the service was fast and friendly  i ordered the hardy gal breakfast   9 95  and the cafe latte   3   the latte was delicious but disappointing that it was served in a glass cup  as it makes it difficult to hold the hot contents   the menu was one page with the second dedicated to drinks  there was also a little section welcoming and thanking customers  with some history of the place included  a nice touch   our meals arrived exactly 9 minutes after ordering  pretty fast  and considering they were full on packed  quite impressive    the meal was good  but nothing spectacular  the bread was pre buttered which im always in favor of  there was also a small shredded apple salad included which was lovely and complimented the rest of the dish nicely  when i asked for ketchup  it was served in a shot glass  hmm  although i was satisfied with my portion size  the rest of my table was not  total bill for the two of us   30   overall  nice food  nice buzz but a bit overpriced 
the night shift manager  mr hernandez is a great manager  he greeted me upon arrive and treated with with so much respect  you can tell he has a lot of management skills  definitely had a great experience because of this guy  i will be coming back
never get seated    wait for 3 hours     me and my boyfriend was trying to get a table around 7pm and the guy outside said they have no space right now if we want we can come back at 8 30  me and my boyfriend agreed and booked our name for 8 30  so we came back at the time because i really wanna try their seafood risotto  the guy told us he was surprised that they still had no space blablabla and told us to wait for another half hour  i gave him my number and asked he to call me immediately when table is available  we were sooooo hungry and cold  me and my boyfriend waited across the street for a bit and saw people walking out like they were just finished    and he just dont let us in     we waited till 9 20 he never called me or anything  we end up having instant noodle at home right now   i just dunt understand why he dont let us in  like 3 hours     and he said they have no reservation after 8 30  until close     no space   guess he just dont want us in  but why    it feels like we are on some black list or something but it was our first time ever  he can just told us sorry that we cant have your guys tonight so we can choose to have sth else not wasted all night waited for nothing       this is just soooooooo unforgivable 
first time i went there and will never come back again poor service and get rip off   they even didnt ask for our drinks   rushing for order without explanation when i told them im first time there  they didnt stop by my table to ask about anything at all plus they wasnt busy  i usually very easy and understand when the restaurant get busy but i have to say very bad service  and the food not worth it  
came in early tuesday evening for dinner  just did ayce korean bbq which is  22  i usually judge a korean restaurant by their banchan  banchan was meh  we had to ask for kimchi  they give you a dipping sauce to start  but if you want samjang or sesame oil with salt pepper  they have it upon request  they also have radish wrap and lettuce upon request too   we had ordered a lot of things during our first go  and our server forgot a few which we reordered and eventually got  spicy garlic edamame  was meh  tasted like they were steamed from frozen  mushroom poppers and green onion salad was good  steamed egg was weird and strangely  holey   full of air bubbles and was rubbery  not soft and fluffy  bf said they probably used powdered eggs  friends ordered the cold buckwheat noodle  said it was okay  wasnt exactly cold  more like room temp  cool  their pork belly is a little weird too  not your typical strip of  three layered  pork  all the other meats we had were okay at best  kind of hard coming here with kbbq standards from socal  norcal 
i have been going to this place for over 10 years  i moved back to mt and when i visit vegas  i always go to hh  i get the cheeseburger and the hot chicken tenders  yum 
excellent meats    they gave us a taste of each one before we ordered  hard to pick one   luckily dont have to   you can getter than one with you meal 
gorgeous new store   wide isles  salad bar  sushi bar  starbucks  deli   a large variety of different brands   many brands of like items   the marketplace items  dishes  kitchen appliances  cookware are a welcome addition   it is possible to get all shopping done at one store    the staff is upbeat  professional and helpful   i have shopped there over a dozen times and have always had a positive experience   there are many promotional sale items    it offers outside seating overlooking the golf course if you want to have coffee or lunch with a beautiful view   it offers a redbox outside 
i took my 3 year old grandson   1 year old granddaughter for an afternoon   it was a great time   the tall slide is fast and fun   my  grandson was able to maneuver himself in the climbing nets and jumping areas   the big draw was the climbing wall   the gentleman working was more than happy to put the climbing belt on him and give him the basics of climbing   my grandson loved it   there is an area for little tykes like my 1 year old   she had a good time in the baby play area that was more mellow   there are arcade games and a concession area for lunch   everything seemed in tip top shape   they offer kids foods like mac   cheese  lunchables  hot dogs  nachos  ice cream  juice  milk   more   the staff was very attentive   they were very happy and helpful   we had a great time   we will go again 
this is the best pest control company ive used in the valley  they did a great job with my monthly service prior to me selling my house  in addition two diffent times i had bees in my back yard  once under my tough shed and over a year later coming into my house  both times cam responded quickly and resolved the problem for a very reasonable price  if i ever own a home in the valley again  they will for sure have my business 
the 3 of us went in for a light dinner   drinks  the drinks were very weak   paid 14 00 each  ouch  then two of us shared a fajita   one had a side  bean burrito   our bill was 75 00  plus tip  the dinner was good  but the drinks are rediculouse  why try   make a fortune on the alcohol  because we will not be going here for a good time  hey  maybe the rent is so high  they have to make it up on the drinks  if you want people to stay   spend more money  lower your prices  or make stronger drinks  the dinner was average 
this is the best nail salon i have ever been to  they are extremely professional  with an artistic flair  if you want to be spoiled go to sun lakes nail salon 
super friendly cocktail waitress who knew the specialty drink menu  just stopped for a drink on way to dinner  would definitely go back
best subs in montreal  the pizza is also excellent and more ny style than napolitani style pizza  its not a pretentious place and the quality of the food is what keeps people coming back after all these years 
great ambiance service food drinks and all the way around an amazing place  must go  we had peel and eat shrimp  tacos were great and my non burrito bit ate his in about 5 minutes 
this was my first time with a moving company as well as moving into a place by myself for the first time as well and they did beyond an amazing job  i had a two man crew with just unloading services  i moved to the 3rd flood of an apartment complex  and with the arizona heat they had full kitchen  dining set  living room  full bedroom and more than 60 boxes up in less than an hour  i know that sounds crazy but they did it   i was beyond surprised and relieved  with the stress of moving into my first place they took a lot off of my shoulders  whenever i do move again they will be first people that i call 
why are mexican dessert places always so dirty    i like the location  i like the selection of treats and snacks  although i think im probably 20 years past the tostiloco phase of life   i like the prices and the friendly service  unfortunately  the ambiance leaves something to be desired  dirty tables  dirty ground  cluttered ordering  serving counter  empty napkin and topping dispensers  seriously  they couldnt even give us napkins when we asked   although i know its not really their specialty  i would really really like a fresh fruit raspado  overall  i wont go out of my way  but when the girls or i are in the area  craving a raspado  mexicali is a good stop 
the pizza at this place is pretty much 2 stars  its fine  but ive definitely had better  the crust is plain and a little on the soggy side  and the sauce is too sweet for my tastes  cheese and toppings are fine  though  and everything is in large enough quantities   i didnt try the wings but my husband said they were just ok   garlic bread was good  but the breadsticks were a little bland  id recommend they look into the seasoning that pizza hut puts on theirs   its delicious   im bumping them to 3 stars based on value  if you get the yelp deal and the pizza n wings special  you can get 2 larges  2 dozen wings  and breadsticks for  20  which is a pretty cheap way to feed a crowd 
some of the best craft brew in the city with delicious food to match  im a regular at the indie and have yet to sample something i dont love  the beer flights are a great way to discover the beers  though im partial to the broken hipster  the witner toque and glory and consequences  there are lots of hoppy ipa choices too  of course  but its one of the only craft breweries in the city that has delicious options for the non hoppy beer drinkers too  theres a retail store so you can pick up your favourite growlers too  in january of each year they sell a limited number of memberships where you get a monthly growler   but they do sell out quickly  delicious pizzas  burgers  smoked meat specials and the bacon grano padano popcorn is a must 
holy cow  we had an incredible breakfast today  lots of food  excellent bread  the meat was juicy   potatoes were hot and tasted fresh and not like a reheated afterthought  we will absolutely be eating there again 
incredible service  nice ambiance and excellent food  had the veggie pasta and the avacado pasta dinners for lunch  food couldnt have been more perfect  pasta was al dente and spiced just right  definitely one of the best 
we have used dunn edwards throughout our entire home and are very pleased with the quality  this is the second time matthew  the color advisor  has assisted us in choosing colors  the first time was to paint the outside of our home  he was able to take our photos and show us different shades of paint with trim colors  the colors we chose turned out wonderful  the second time we visited with him we were struggling with a dark accent wall that needed to be changed  he was able to come up with a color to tie together all the other shades we had in a room  including walls and decor  he is very patient and very good at finding the colors that work specifically for you  i highly recommend taking the time to visit with matthew before choosing paint 
went here for the first time this past weekend   fast and cheap  for sure  but the manicures dont last  mine started chipping the very next day      i have been getting opi manicures for years and they are usually intact for about a week   while i was there  i noticed one of the staff topping up opi top coat bottles from a larger bottle that was most definitely not opi branded  i suspect they may be using opi bottles but filling them with cheaper  poor quality stuff   im not going back   id rather pay more for a manicure that lasts more than 24 hours 
weve been to this location many times  and have never been disappointed with the food or service   the sushi is always fresh  and once we discovered the super volcano we automatically order it upon being seated  their mussels are dee lish  the sashimi always tender and the prices are oh so reasonable  we highly recommend this place to anyone 
just moved to goodyear and went in wanting something new  brought in a picture of what i wanted and angel worked his magic   my hair turned out better than the picture i showed him  he completely rocked my new hair color that i wanted  the experience was great very personable 
we enjoyed our outdoor patio meal so much two weeks ago we decided to return for more of the same last night  unfortunately  the weather wasnt as cooperative second time around but the meal and service didnt fail to live up to prior expectations    things are a bit more crowded and noisy in the restaurant than out  and even though wed dined inside once before a couple of years ago  we hadnt realized theres an additional patio area to the rear of the establishment  so in order to have conversation with our friends we did have to raise our speaking voices a good deal to be heard over the volume of the large size bar and friday night crowd but seemed to quickly adjust  our server appeared quickly  gave us a warm welcome and reviewed our options  including the missions signature drinks and table side guacamole   as an aside   two weeks ago we decided upon medium spiciness but it packed a punch  this time we scaled back to mild and it was perfect for a delicate palate  server was very attentive to providing more chips as soon as we made our way through the dip    my husband knew he wanted to save room for dessert so ordered steak tacos which were limited to about three small but favorable slightly bigger than bite size tacos  i selected my favorite  jhidori chicken  tender  succulent chicken slices spread over rice  with two flavorful sauces  desert was their flavorful churros and one serving was actually enough to be shared four ways    parking can be challenging in old towne but its worth a little extra walk to go the distance for a gastronomic experience at the mission 
met friends here last night for our second enjoyable dining experience at this fine dining establishment   this time we chose to eat inside  although the outdoor area is lovely  albeit due to the somewhat confined area  we had noted the tables to be somewhat small in accommodating everyones plates  water and wine glasses during the main course   it was the first time for the couple we had joined us and they were very pleased with our selection  except for the lack of valet service id assured them the house provided as they had last time  my husband and i had lucked out by getting the last spot in the small parking lot but in downtown scottsdale at prime dining hour on a saturday night  spots are not easy to come by  apparently  theres a little known lot around the corner in which patrons can park but it would help to be made aware of this at time of reservations  confirmation    in any event  we sat directly across from the kitchen but were pleased to see   and hear   that not only was it not noisy  but how efficiently orders were placed  with attention to detail as my husband and i heard while awaiting our friends arrival    and then picked up for delivery to the tables  our own selections were well prepared to our specifications with the appropriate amounts of time between seating  ordering and courses being brought to the table  my husband and i both enjoyed the arugula salad followed by chicken atop risotto   at first we thought the entree looked small and regretted not having ordered a side dish but it turned out to be plentiful and succulent  our friend is wine enthusiast so we deferred to him for our wine selections and were pleased with his choices     aside from the presentation and preparation  the staff was attentive  accommodating and friendly   truly made for an excellent dining experience 
what a disappointment   a beautiful patio full of cigarette smoke   even the menus smell bad   according to our waitress she re sat us in the  non smoking section of the patio  on the fake green grass   this area is right next to the smokers and the bar is directly adjacent where patrons were smoking there  as well   we then moved to the inside where unfortunately the onion rings we ordered were way over cooked and too greasy   we just went for appetizers and wine   service was good but nothing else was   what a poor business decision considering the area it is located in has far more non smokers than smokers   i didnt even think it was legal in gilbert to allow smoking where food was being served but i must be wrong   we wont be back 
what a nice job upgrading this little theater   i was afraid that due to low occupancy this theater would close or become a dollar theater  however  they went the other way   the theater now has a more intimate feeling with large reclining seats and definitely more of an upscale feel   good job   purchase your tickets online to guarantee a sea this theater is small and intimate   i hope they take it a step further and bring in a liquor license which allows for wine and then also food service   please please please   gilbert needs this and it would differentiate you even more from the big harkins  amc 
excellent indian food and food service  i think it is the best in the east valley and i have tried all of them   they always make me chana shaag which is not even on the menu 
food  asian wings  chicken salad  and cajan sandwich  and beer were good but the prices were a little high for the amount of food  quality was decent  nothing out of this world  the service that we received from lacey was some of the worst that we have ever had  took forever for her to great us  didnt refill drinks  was snobby when she asked questions   is she done with that   when the plate had a napkin covering it with the tableware in top making it clear that it could be taken away    slapped the check down after her rude  did you save any room for anything else   and when she returned with the card  slapped it down once again and rudely said  thanks   if the food and beer werent good we wouldnt even think of coming back to this place 
great burgers  nice atmosphere     be there early if you need a table for four or more  otherwise youll be waiting a while 
i find it hard to believe the owner  woman  is from buffalo  as she is the rudest small business owner in nc  we have been to this rest several times  and are blown away by her poor attitude  stingy portions  extra charges for sauces  and general lack of customer service  today was the best one yet  in that she made us take my babies sippie cup outside  because they dont allow outside drinks    ummm yeahhhh      last time well spend our money here  and this is why 85  of small business fail in the first 5 years  enjoy your stool by the window 
just completed my second case with cogburn law  brenda  alexandro  and everyone else at the firm were very helpful in ensuring that my case was handled in a professional and timely manner  i would highly recommend them 
space   looks modest from the street  but its pretty nice inside  and not as tight as it looks  though it looks tight    i was first drawn in via the large open air window in the front   often  when i come here  i sit at the bar   its central located  but never in the way of the staff or other customers   there is a very nice patio in the back  which i did not even realize existed until my second visit   incognito   service   great   friendly staff who give excellent food related advice and recommendations   in fact  it was a bartender here who first recommending klb raspberry wheat to me when i asked what beer i should have   ive never looked back   food   its great   boasting a wide variety of very tasty burgers and burritos    as well as  of course  less heart attack inducing fare    makes this place an instant win in my books   the burgers quickly become delicious catastrophes on your plate    which all good burgers should   rating   five las estrellas   i love the people working here  the atmosphere  and  importantly  the food 
i got seaweed salad  black tonkotsu with thick noodles  bamboo shoots  mushrooms  and and extra egg  i also had a couple of sapporos and some hot tea  the meal was fantastic  it came out quickly  was very reasonably priced  and tasted great  the place is not very big and easy to miss from the street  but it was quite nice on the inside  i was seated almost immediately and the service was very responsive  i would definitely recommend this place for ramen 
this was my first experience here  crab and shrimp dip appetizer was good  my wife and i ordered a deep dish pizza with spinach  feta cheese  pepperoni  onions  banana peppers  and garlic  they forgot the banana peppers and the garlic  we also had a few long island iced teas  we sat near the bar  the bartender  waitress wasnt really very good  the food and atmosphere was awesome  i wouldve rated it better except for the bartender  waitress  we went there around 2 45pm  so it wasnt like it was too busy either 
just an update  i had the misfortune of trying chili by beverlys gourmet at the south end chili cook off   it was easily worst of show  thats some really bad advertising   well deserved for a crappy business    i had the misfortune of buying a groupon for a cooking class by beverlys gourmet   i soon realized that given the large number of groupons sold relative to the extremely small number of cooking class slots allotted to groupon holders that it was going to be nearly impossible to book a class  while i was having a very difficult time getting a class booked  groupon was again offering this  deal    after numerous attempts i finally managed to get a class scheduled   i left work early to get to the class on time  but upon arrival i was told that the class had been canceled   i was not contacted in advance to inform me of this which i consider to be extremely rude and unprofessional   unfortunately  i was unable to get my money refunded   my time was wasted   my money was wasted   total rip off 
are you hungry  really really hungry  then this is the place you should check out  the restaurant is tiny with limited seatings so you might be seated next to strangers  which we were okay with   i really wished i knew how much food each entree was because i would have shared a bowl of noodle with my boyfriend  we both couldnt finish the food and felt overstuffed afterwards    they bring out some veggie appetizers before the actual meal which was refreshing to eat  i had their spicy beef noodle while my boyfriend ordered the nouilles de zhajiang  the noodles were really fresh and so good  both dishes were flavorful and not overly salted  spicy    for the amount of food we got  it was well worth it  come check this place out 
what a great addition to the plaza midwood restaurant scene   ive been twice now and am pretty excited about this new place   my family and i went on a saturday for brunch   we are two adults with an 8 year old and 3 year old twins   we really  really liked the brunch menu   my husband had two different fancy beers  which he liked   i didnt have anything to drink  but saw some other folks having yummy looking bloody marys and mimosas   but it was the food that was delicious   husband had a burger and i their version of a blt   the kids had burgers and grilled cheeses   we were all very happy with our meals and i thought mine was really yummy   today  i went back for lunch with a girlfriend   i had the vidalia onion bisque and my friend had a chicken wrap thingy   she loved her lunch and snarfed it down   my soup was fine  but im honestly less of a cream based soup fan than a broth based soup fan   so i would have liked a broth based soup option   it was still fine     we are planning on going back again   when we were there for lunch  the let us wander around the place looking at the views   the upstairs view of downtown is worth coming and having a drink or three with some friends   kind of fancy for plaza midwood 
awesome twist on asian and mexican food  wonderful decor  beautiful plates and delicious hot tea  bravo             
i liked it and got a kick out of the name so wanted to try it  pretty awesome            
to us it was a perfect place and the rooms were clean  my parents stayed next door and liked it also   my bed was comfy and the employees helpful  you cant beat the value for the price and i would recommend this place to people who understand that its a family run little motel and want to support local business owners  thank you again     
first time to arizona and i fell in love   lori was absolutely fabulous and very accommodating  she gave us good tips about the surrounding places and made us feel at home  met up with my soon to be mother in law and we all had a wonderful time  it was very quiet and the pool was very refreshing 
service was average  had to ask for refills which took a long time  if you are looking for the experience and a  snack  by all means visit this restaurant  we ordered the  get your feet wet  for my husband and i with the  hot and juicy  seasoning  which was horrible   big pieces of garlic  left the place hungrier than we came in  the pound of shrimp translated into about 6 7 large shrimp and  a few crawfish  the edible portion of the meal was only about 15  with most of it being the potato and corn  wouldnt go back 
no dialog  and slow moving had me dosing off within 10 minutes if it was good i was considering seeing the others now i dont plan to waist another night in vagas on this company
the food is really good  but they really need to work out their service issues  there seems to be varying levels of experience in the waitstaff  i started by ordering some hot tea  and the server tells me they dont have it so i pointed it out on the menu  he says again that they dont have it which i took to mean that they ran out   i then asked if the green tea is sweetened and he says a little bit but they can always make it sweeter  i said i actually dont want sweetened tea so i ordered an unsweetened ice tea and he proceeds to ask if i want sugar packets  i got the sense hes new to waiting tables and doesnt know how to veer off from script   he then comes back 5 minutes later and apologizes for forgetting to start up our grill  he walks away and we had to flag him down to take our order  that was the last we saw of him  after that we were waited on by a girl who seemed more comfortable at interacting with people    i noticed the table next to us was asked whether they wanted their grill changed out while they were still cooking their food  uh  where are they supposed to put the raw meats in the meantime  we werent asked whether we wanted our grill changed until we were ready for our check  i think management should work on establishing more consistency   we quite enjoyed our meal until it came time to pay  i think this restaurant is trying too hard to be hip  instead of having your server take your payment or going to the front of the restaurant to pay  you have to wait for the designated person to come to you with a handheld card reader  our server apologized for the wait and said there would be no wait if we paid cash  doesnt the restaurant realize people dont carry cash anymore  and dont they realize they are a full service restaurant and not a little food truck or cafe  there were so many irritated people waiting to pay it was unbelievable    please invest in a regular cash register  i understand it takes away the coolness factor  but itll make your customers so much happier  heres a tip to fellow diners  ask to pay your bill 30 minutes before youre ready to leave 
my daughter and i went there yesterday to get our hair done  it was such a wonderful experience  megan did my daughters hair  and jackie did my hair  they both are such nice women  the salon is great  and my hair looks better than it has in many years 
good sandwiches and nice atmosphere   great selection of pop and beer   coffee is good  but not fantastic   friendly staff   tends to be the hang out for all the goth and dead head types  but its nice that they have a place to go   open almost all the time  often the only place downtown that is   
moved in the first of the year and thought we found the perfect place to start our new life in the las vegas area while we looked for a home to purchase   nice complex  nice units  a little on the pricey side but we felt like it was a good safe start until we got familiar with nevada   it wasnt long before we realized that many of the tenants in the complex with pets do not clean up their animals waste even though the complex provides stations with bags   we brought this to managements attention in january and again in february   after complaining yet again in march we have been told by management that this is common among complexes that allow pets and it is impossible to enforce the complex rules regarding this matter   we knew moving from a home of 20 years to an apartment there would be some adjustments and differences to get used to  but we never imagined animal waste would be one of them   we thought it was nice that apartments allowed pets  they didnt back in our day when we were renters  and had no idea such problems existed    not sure which is more frustrating  management that admits it cant enforce its own rules or people with such lack of consideration for their neighbors    if you dont mind neighbors who leave animal waste  the flies and other problems it creates  then this place is perfect   being new to the state our experience here has not left a very good first impression of the area or its residents   needless to say we will not renew our lease and cannot wait to get out of this complex 
love this place   the decor is the most plain youll see in vegas  yet  we always have a great time here  fantastic beer  really nice service and they have games like cards against humanity behind the bar  just ask your server for a game 
all the reviews are right   wow  so good  i had the miso  7 25 for a bowl of delishesness
so  i first was going to buy a car from empire motors next door  but it didnt work out due to them not being helpful and false advertising on their website  so i went here and the first thing that happened was an employee opens up the door for me  i explained what kind of car i wanted and the monthly price range and within 10 minutes they pulled a couple cars up for me to look at and test drive  i made my choice and then the financial guy did take awhile to get everything sorted out  but thats what will happen when you are a college student with barely any credit  so he worked on getting a deal and he found one and moments later i drove off in my new  used  car  i loved the service  plus  the lady that helped us was named keyyah so she fit the job very well  she is a great saleswoman and was very patient with me making my decision  she didnt influence me on which car to buy  she just told me the information and the choice was mine  will be buying another car from here in the future 
small little place down to earth quiet setting awesome biscuits and gravy you have to come before 11 or you wont get breakfast
i ordered a powerade which was pictured clearly on their drive thru menu  was told that they dont have any  then i asked for a water bottle instead  and again  i was told they dont have that either  never once did she mention that they were out at the moment  but that they dont sell that     then why would it be on the menu   then as i drive up to the window it is in an awkward turn which leaves me more distant than usual at a drive thru window  the same girl handed me my drink but then quickly withdrew and refused to give it to me until i paid  very unprofessional  she shouldnt have tried to hand me my  2 drink if she thought i wasnt going to pay  i always hand over my card or my cash first thing  and who goes to a fast food place to rob them of a drink    she must think it comes out of her welfare check or something because it was pretty uncalled for and unnecessary  good job whataburger for hiring incompetent hs drop outs with no common sense 
this hotel is the southern most hotel on the strip  closest to mccarran  its about a half mile north of the welcome sign   we booked through southwest airlines and their vacation package  and it was a pretty good price for what you got   check in was easy  we got to our room   its a king room  we booked a double queen   we got moved  to the infamous room 11111   i had to put that in there   sweet  everythings good now  room was decent  there is a minibar with snacks in the room  which  like every other hotel  is ridiculously expensive   on site starbucks  rather the 3 of them on site  charges about  5 for a cup of coffee  so thats cool   its a huge complex  with a large gaming floor and youll get lost real quick  i got my bearings after the first night  it gets easy later on   if you have an m life card  thatll get you a discount at their restaurants  and the other mgm restaurants throughout vegas   and its a fairly significant discount  so get that   theres a tram that takes you between here  the luxor  and the excalibur  and from the excalibur theres a skywalk that can take you to ny ny  mgm grand  and tropicana   staff was nice  and everything was great   4 stars  however  because the pool was ridiculously busy at literally every time of day  its full of kids  i never used it   i would probably recommend staying more center strip  somewhere in between planet hollywood and wynn  thats where all the shopping and  fun  stuff happens   other than that  its a pretty nice place with lots to offer 
after suffering a serious concussion i found cornerstone physio therapy and have worked with both joon and jocelyn   i have had serious back and foot issues and tried many physios   and lets face it there are good and bad ones   i cant say enough good things about cornerstone   joon cured me of my bppv  vertigo after the fall that caused the concussion  and helped me to be confident back on my feet asap  and actually with better balance than before the fall   he recommended jocelyn to help with the whiplash i suffered from the fall   jocelyn has magical hands   she knows exactly where to push  pull  stretch  hold to help loosen and heal   the office staff at both locations are patient and kind   this practice is professional and caring   i have recommended them to friends and family 
this store is what got me in love with katsu curry  it comes in a pretty big portion  enough to fill you right up  they also let you choose the level of spicyness but i usually only get 2 or 3  their takoyaki is also really good  i usually always order the same 2 things from here  but i wouldnt mind venturing off either cause everything is amazing 
  when we got there and seated  the waiter had a  i hate my job  vibe  when she gave us our jinya bun  she basically just threw it on the table  the restaurant just didnt really have a friendly environment  which  is probably affecting my reviewing rate quite a bit      the jinya bun tasted good  but it tasted like any other siopao  for  3  i guess that would be reasonable for any bun  we ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the original chicken ramen  the noodles had a different kind of texture that arent typical for noodles  it reminded me of potato noodles  which are really good  the ramen itself  filled enough for one person  which is enough for us because we ordered 2      the prices ranged around  10  20  i believe the noodles i ordered were around the price of  11  12     would i go there again  yeah  i think i would  to try the other kinds of ramen they have  as for the service  thats something they should probably work on  im not going back for the good service  but the good food      rate  6  10   price    
  let me first say something  ive tried other kbbq restaurants  but this is  by far  my favorite lbbq of them all  they give so many sides that the table is basically full and i love the sides  this is probably my 3rd time eating there and it ceases to disappointment      once you walk into gen  you get a feel of the aesthetic look of the restaurant  it looks like it would be one of those super expensive restaurants youd find at the strip  but let me tell you something  the price is great  for all you can eat  its  16 for lunch and  20 99 for dinner  it sets a great romantic mood because of the darkness and pastel lights  its usually busy there but its really nothing to be worried about  the wait to be seated was very short  sometimes theres no wait at all  although  on the days its really busy  its kind of hard to get the waiters attention so you could order more      for the sides  they give clear noodles  kimchi  spicy pickled cucumbers  rice cakes  peas  salad  and others  im not sure what they are tbh   they all taste amazing and i could basically just eat them and get full  but anyways  we  2 of us  lasted for about 4 rounds of orders  our favorite orders would probably be the gen chadol  beef brisket   gen beef bulgolgi  marinated beef   and chicken bulgolgi  marinated chicken   of course weve tried a bunch others and theyre just as amazing  theyre all flavorful and not bland like other meats in some kbbqs      would i go there again  yes    i have and will continue to do so  so far  it still marks as the best kbbq for me      rate 10  10    
although the business man special looked rather appetizing  my business skills were not up to par this week enough for me to afford myself such a  luxury  i had the green chili pork  and just like jim g i thought it was bomb  i was fortunate though to have one of my business associates there with me   and as he had a great week  he allowed himself the business man special  he got the shredded beef   best in town   the taco he had was also said to be bomb  great meal all around  
just like the govt to have a satellite branch but no signs on the building that the henderson branch does not replace cards or provide new cards yet if you ask one of the brilliant clerks they are not a satellite branch  how can a city of over 1 million have no offices in henderson 
salad was good so many options soup was good also corn claim cowder   dis was my first time here i most def   will be coming back
my 7 year old garage door opener system completely broke down yesterday trapping my car in the garage  i had the idrive type of opener system and i didnt realize that wayne dalton had discontinued this system  i got three bids  one from a1 garage door service  another from eagle garage doors  and one from garage doors 4 less  not only did adrian beat the other bids but he was  300 less than a1  he is very customer service oriented and i was completely satisfied  the total job entailed converting my idrive to a spring type and replacing the wayne dalton opener with a chamberlain opener  he also replaced my basic rollers with the ball bearing type  he programmed the remote controllers too  overall  i was very happy that i used adrian from garage doors 4 less  save yourself the grief and give him a call  youll be happy with adrian from garage doors 4 less 
far and away the best greek food ive had in az so far  havent had a bad meal there yet  they are always very busy so i recommend ordering ahead for pickup or getting there right when they open   my favs  falafel hummus dolmas greek salad  delicious 
came across this place by accident  and was shocked at how great it was   very clean interior and a complete american style menu   the club sandwich came with nice thick turkey breast slices   this is a new favorite spot 
best coffee is vegas hands down  everything from the baristas to the manager to the ambiance  the outdoor seating is prefect for late evening before of after dinner drinks  a great place to have a coffee date or drink solo  if youre ever undecided what to drink let the barista know what youre in the mood for and they will definitely deliver 
ive ate at this place a couple times during my trips in vegas  the prices here are ridiculous but then again  its vegas  the portions are pretty big but their pho isnt as authentic as the bay areas  i would say the best dish here is the beef stew  definitely something to try    brilliant idea to put a pho place here though  its the best hang over food ever  haha  if you end up staying at treasure island  they also do room service for this place 
do not waste your time coming here  slowest service ive ever experienced  its was not busy and theyre clearly not short staffed  just ridiculously slow 
we recently purchased a 2013 altima at earnhardt nissan     all of the transaction paperwork was completed using an incorrect vin from another vehicle on their lot   loan documents  registration  purchase contract  mileage verification  etc   we insured and registered the vehicle with the incorrect vin and drove it for 10 days before being informed of this negligent error   this was obviously unacceptable and the  oh well   mistakes happen  attitude of their finance manager made it insulting   they placed us at risk through their negligence which is unforgivable   when they presented the corrected paperwork to us for signature it was clear they had again not thoroughly reviewed it because the purchase price had slightly increased   how do errors of this magnitude occur and why arent members of the sales and support team working together to avoid placing their customers at legal and financial risk     if  treat everyone the way you would treat your mama  is their mantra  i sincerely hope that someone else has been granted medical power of attorney for family members   i also purchased a new hyundai sonata at horne hyundai in apache junction the same weekend and the experience was remarkably better   the transaction took 1  3rd the time  the paperwork was was correct  no games during the sales process and the finance manager was very competent and reviewed their work   horne seemed to work as a customer service team which was much different than my other experience of the day   my recommendation is to consider the 2013 altima  its a great car with excellent mileage  but to buy it elsewhere   earnhardt lost our trust and confidence and we will never buy or service a car at one of their dealerships 
despite many of the extremely poor reviews that marcellos has received on yelp my wife and i decided to take a chance and dine there last evening   the short of it   i wish we hadnt    service was generally good  the waitress was attentive and the restaurant had a suitable ambiance   a good combination of family style and traditional italian   the food  however  was a much different story   my wife and i both ordered pizza   i ordered pepperoni and she ordered canadian bacon with pineapple   both of our pizzas were the most absolutely tasteless  bland concoctions we have experienced   there was literally no sauce on either of our pizzas  just greasy cheese  a very flat  bland crust and a small amount of toppings   without sauce  the pizza was just terrible   it was dry  somewhat greasy from the cheese and it literally had no flavor whatsoever   this was the most disappointing meal that i have had in quite some time and it came to  40 including tip for 2 pizzas  2 soft drinks and 2 salads   when i told the waitress about the quality of the food  she simply mentioned that they have a new person preparing the pizzas in the kitchen and that things may be a little off due to the transition   it seems puzzling that someone  despite how new they are  could forget to put sauce on the pizzas   honestly  im not sure sauce alone would have been sufficient to revive marcellos tasteless pies   if you are hungry for pizza  you will be much better off buying a tombstone or a jacks for  4 at walmart and cooking it yourself   or better yet  go to boulders on broadway or grimaldis where you will get excellent food and great service at a comparative bargain price 
jason c provided us with excellent customer service  we walked in on a whim not really knowing where to start with our yard and he went above and beyond to show us our options  well definitely be back and look forward to the great service again soon 
rustic  hectic  packed  fabulous  cozy cafe with a parisian flair in both decor and flavor in old montreal  stumbled upon this gem as we came in from the metro and decided to walk as much of rue st  paul as possible    three of us did not finish every bite on the diverse charcuterie board of bread and various meats  pates  fruits  and a tealight melting cheese trough  bon jour  gorgeous    an enormous brownie somehow made its way to the table  and was so decadently gooey we had to cross the canadian border to get it  the baked goods in the case at the rear of the cafe all looked scrumptious  as did the freshly baked baguettes being loaded into an overhead tray    some folks seemed to come in for takeaway  lining up in the back where the register is and where you pay your bill  they take credit cards     a terrific and vibrant atmosphere with self proclaimed crazy frenchmen  and chic decor galore  they spoke french until it was clear we were not fluent  and they transitioned into english out of pity and not snobbishness  thrilled to have found this tasty  enjoyable spot and would recommend any hungry yelper seek it out  cest magnifique 
michael was an incredible person to work with   my iron door is amazing  but the install took several times to get it right   michael was there every step of the way to make sure the finish was perfect   he is very knowledgeable and stays true to his word   i highly recommend iron doors arizona to anyone who wants to change the look of their home from average to outstanding 
very professional  extreme attention to detail and completely reliable  trustworthy judgement and time effective results  sam is the best thing thats ever happened in my life    
after work drinks  around union station  decided on loose moose  took everyone quite a while to get their drinks after repeatedly being told they are out  and super slow service in between  ordered the sweet potato thing  actual name in the menu  to share and it was alright  nothing special  we were there relatively early  but started getting busy after 5pm and people were holding the doors open so cold drafts were getting in  otherwise  nothing too special 
im new to scottsdale and i decided to try out new serenity spa based off of the positive responses i saw on yelp  im so happy i did because my experience was wonderful   i already have another appointment set up to go back in a few weeks 
super fast repair and awesome customer service  their prices are completely affordable too 
stopped in for lunch on valentine day just to get out out of the brutal cold for awhile  what a pleasant surprise this place turned out to be   service was fast and friendly and the food was of good quality  my lady had the feta omelet  food was fresh and tasty accompanied by a crispy caeser salad  i opted for the bangers and mash  sausage was nicely spiced and tender  the mashed potatoes were authentic  lumps and all  very good   a nice rich gravy and sauteed onions added a nice touch  the peas that came with the dinner were frozen but still complimented the dish  check this place out  good food at a reasonable price 
since moving to nv  my husband and i are trying all of the buffets  golden nugget seems to be our default place when we cant decide on one  its nice and simple  clean and friendly  food is pretty good  nothing orgasmic and its reasonibly priced  kids enjoy it too 
after some lengthy investigating  i made an appointment with roxane  super friendly front desk staff and super friendly masseur  i did 90 min massage and cupping  it seriously went by so fast  because im so tense and knotted up  the deep tissue massage was uncomfortable for parts of it  once roxane got it to relax  it felt delightful  this was my first time cupping and it was not painful but more uncomfortable and pinchy  she explained in the beginning it would be like that   the best part was when she released the cups and rubbed over it  i felt my muscles in a true relaxed state  next day i was pretty sore  again though  i was so tight  i expected to be sore next day  today  just a tiny bit sore in some places and cup marks on my back  expected   i have much better range of motion since im not as tight  im going back in a month for another massage  cupping sess  i cant wait 
i havent been able to find a good nail shop since i moves here a year ago and this place is amongst the worst ive been to  im speaking on the actual quality of work   im not even done getting my feet done right now  the water was cold  the girl doing the service hands are like ice cubes  i got a half has light pressured rub  my one year old probably could have rubbed my feet better   i was going to get a full set but just 5 minutes in i knew i would never be back here  i am down right dissatisfied   if im paying for something shit better be done to specification  this place blows hands down
outstanding  me and my family have been coming here for over 10 years  food is great and the customer service is even better  thank you and keep it up  cant go wrong with this place 
ordered fiesta nachos   total disappointment   albondigas soup  chips a salsa   salsa tasted like canned tomatoes with a little cilantro and onion    the nachos were soggy and loaded with tasteless shredded chicken and beef  soup was slimy and the meatball tasted like un seasoned hamburger  the only thing that was good was the cold beer  
tired of being caught off guard by having your food arrive quicker than expected   well this is the place to be  your food is guaranteed to never arrive promptly or even on time  if your in the mood for some chilled wings look no further than gametime eatery  proudly serving the best chilled wings in the gta   extra star given for acceptable service 
stop searching for landscape artists and hire this team  after reading the yelp reviews i just had to meet tony to see if what i read was true  it was   this guy is a true professional   he took my ideas and put them with his expertise and created a backyard that i am completely satisfied with  just know that i am so picky on details that i usually do everything myself  my biggest pet peeve with hiring home services is communication and lopez has done the best job  they used email  followed up on phone calls and even used secondary phone messages when we didnt answer the first phone number  we knew what was happening and when it was happening during the entire process   with the quality and detail  i really felt like they were working on their own homes   on one day i saw an oddity on the edge of barbecue construction and before i could bring it up to tony  he had already caught it and was having his guy fix it to his standards  and ultimately mine    my job included pavers  irrigation  plantings  gravel  lighting and a barbecue 
taking the recommendations of a friend of a friend  i headed to maison kam fung to get some takeaway   the restaurant is on the 2nd floor   and the only way i found it was because of the neon sign in the window  you go through what seems like the entrance to an apartment block but its actually a mini mall  upstairs is a huge room full of round tables and most of the customers are of chinese descent   the staff seem friendly and are bustling   it took longer than they said it would take but i was in no rush  the food was fantastic  i went for the steamed shrimp dumplings  tofu and vegetables and steamed rice  way too much food   the dumplings were by far my favorite and i wished i had just got a few sets of dumplings  the tofu and veggies were generous with huge chunks of lightly fried tofu  big chunks of broccoli and mushrooms  its like they read my mind  my favorite veg  id definitely go there again and would recommend to go for the dim sum 
we had lunch at meat chix on a tuesday   it was later in the day  around 2   so we were the only ones eating  but 2 other tables came in after we ordered   the service was fantastic  very friendly   the food is made to order  so we had to wait a bit  id say about 10 minutes   food was piping hot when it came out   my wife had the corn dog bites  which were enormous and only  8   these are clearly handmade  the batter had excellent corn flavor and the dogs inside were thick and juicy   they are served with housemade honey mustard  which was solid   also good with ranch  or my favorite  classic yellow mustard   on the side  the wife had cottage fries   these were a little overdone and crispy  which i like  but she doesnt   these were probably the weakest dish of the meal  but were still solid   i had the bourbon bacon cheeseburger and onion rings   the burger was cooked to a perfect medium   i feel like a lot of places these days ask you how you want a burger cooked and then cook it medium well no matter what you say   not mcw   very juicy and flavorful   the bun was a soft sesame seed bun  which tastes good but loses something in structural integrity   i had to finish with a fork  but that was fine  it was a fantastic burger   the patty had a nice crust  and was juicy to the end   lots of bacon and they use a nice cheese   i would order this burger again   the onion rings were unlike any ive had  i would describe the better as almost funnel cake like   it was light and very crisp and had a bit of sweetness   we really liked these  and an order is huge   definitely share these     excellent service and quality handmade food   recommended 
was pleasantly surprised by this place   decided to get a quick lunch and didnt want typical food court stuff   so  checked this out   they have a  4 99 blue plate specials   sometimes it comes with a side  other times it doesnt   today  it was the salisbury steak sandwich   i tried it with a side of potato salad   the sandwich was a large hoagie roll  and it was soft   i was impressed  it was very fresh and a solid bread for this sandwich   there are 2 good size pieces of steak on the bun and brown gravy   the brown gravy was again  better than i was expecting   i wanted more in fact  it was a very good representation of traditional brown gravy   other specials are hot turkey sandwich  fish and chips  etc   ill definitely come here again  and likely get the blue plate special again   very solid deal   drinks are  1 99 for a small  so thats annoying  but the price on the special seems to be a good deal  based on this one visit  
awesome awesome awesome  not only was the service spectacular but the food was even better  it didnt cost an arm and a leg either  great coffee  and almost everything is made from scratch  christina was our server and she was excellent  definitely stop by here its worth the 20 minute wait for breakfast or lunch
went here for a pedicure mid week  mid day with no wait which was great  they dont have pedicure chairs so youre just in a chair with a foot bath while your pedicurist is on a stool  they do have lots of opi and essie colors to choose from  no advertised prices that i saw  but my pedi was  20 and was unfortunately surprised that they are cash only 
this place is great for your estate planning needs  super informative affordable   convenient  highly recommend 
i hated going to the dentist until i found dr  wood   he and his staff are so friendly and considerate   i wouldnt go anywhere else 
we ate here for the second time this weekend and it sealed its place in our minds as the best sushi in cleveland  the fish is so  so fresh  the sashimi just melted in our mouth  the staff was friendly and accommodating and it was way less expensive as many of the places closer to downtown  so good 
this was a great find and far exceeded our expectations   the american kenyan fusion is more like american fare with kenyan style and they have a variety of options   the portions are huge and everything our party had was outstanding   check it out 
this arena is awesome  why becasue this is where they hold frozen fury  go kings go  the set up is great  no bad seat in the house  the flow   layout is nice  only bummer is getting out  as with any arena  everyone leaves at once and it gets a little jam packed with drunk people  the arena is very well staffed and has a ton of security 
first review    a very romantic and ambient setting  the music in the background makes it seem like you are somewhere else  and its not loud so you can hear the other person talk    the food was just amazing  we started with dim sums for appetizers and they were so yum  i ordered the seafood special  i believe it had shrimp  calamari and scallops  and they were all fried  just amazing  he ordered the chicken with mushrooms  also very good  definitely recommend this place for a date  or even for a get together with your friends   not a place to be very loud though so maybe not a big birthday party or anything  hope this helps   
after reading the rave reviews  i was excited about bringing our groom and his friends here before his big day   it was underwhelming to say the least   no a  c  claustrophobic space  and a rude woman at the register   maybe she was just having a bad day   either way  after waiting 30 min  the pizza was meh   soggy  ingredients falling off  and a weak crust     other this place being a famous relic  i dont really understand the big deal   i was going to give 2 stars but having folks in our crew who dont eat pork being forced to buy a full pizza bumps this place down to 1 star   goodbye bitondo  i wont be missing you 
hands down best pho in town  also try the beef salad and tom yum soup  i have yet to try the sandwiches and rice dishes  definitely coming back to support the business  i found my new spot 
rampart buffet isnt very good the salad bar is very meager and the food not too good except for the chinese section which was excellent and all toghether i would give it a c   the italian food was also good
i left my review on softaplv about my experience but decided to copy and paste it here as well to let other girls know that mirror mirror does permanent makeup   i had my eyeliners done in another salon  somehow i had no idea that mirror mirror offers this service  and i ended up running to tami begging for help to fix my eyeliners  they werent even with some blank spots   i loved my experience  i would say that softap is way less painful than a regular tattoo machine  most of the time i felt that tami is tapping but it was painless  of course there were some sensitive spots but i didnt feel like im about to jump off the chair even once   besides that tami was very gentle and caring  she listened to me and did exactly what i asked her to do  i love the result and am very excited to see how it will look when i heal   tami  you are the best  i love you  thank you   p s  tami  i promise to remain loyal to the mirror mirror salon from now on  i learned my lessons  cause this was not the first time i ran to you begging to fix something that was done bad at another place  lol 
since i am an avid fan of the pavillions car show i go to ycs and have for over 6 yrs   let me explain why you see an update from 6 months or a year ago the and one from 6 months before that    ive been involve in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years in one capacity or another   i also have been trained in the old school french ssicsl fine dining so i know a little about more than just being a foody       you dont go to ycs  for a sit down dining type abiance  it is the food yet also everything that incorporates good fun and a great experiance     servers   well not exactically   but they will help you make decisions based on what you tell them you like in flavoreds or spices they arent afraid to point you in a direction its your choice to take it       the food is cold and fresh and dated on the cambros they use for storage   they will scrape the circular grill if requested and usually do on a repeats basis   stack the food high and lots    it will shrink as cooked  but personally i use a small soup bowl for my ladles of sauces    i have never been disappointed with any other people here    employees and guests alike   good food   fun atmosphere and above all else   consistancy   good   logistically you dont have a place they does the business they do with out being above average   theres just to many other restaurants to go to in the area if the wee just average  i see reviews here like  its too loud   not healthy etc   yes moderation is the key   case and points  i will sometimes not use any sauces or noodles   i pile on chx and spinach and veg with some ginger and garlic and its awesome and for 10 00 i can eat for two days 
i was very pleased with the entire experience i had getting new glasses here  made my appointment  filled out some paperwork and away we went  got the eyes examined  the optomitrist did a great job explaining the difference in my vision compared to my lasr exam    signed in to begin picking frames and lenses and what not  roxanna was my optician  she really was bringing her  a  game  answered every question i had  she was very professional  had a great attitude  knew the products they offered inside and out  it was very easy to tell she truley enjoyed helping her customers see better  and had good taste for fashion as well    great job eyeglass world  and thank you so much for helping me get two awesome pairs of glasses roxanna  your an all star 
my husband and i shared a sandwich the other day  it was awful  bread was wet  wilted lettuce need i go on  there were crumbs and other things all over the floor  we wont be going back  just thought you should know 
this place is super shady  a group of us had a really bad experience here  people standing near the club were passing out  free  passes and  free drink  wristbands to lure you into the club  they end up making us stand in a long line for absolutely no reason other than to try to make the place look cool  because inside it was dead  after they finally let us in after about 30 minutes of wasted time they charge the guys  10 each  even though they said it was free  but after wasting 30 minutes they decided to just pay the 10 each  we get in  and the wristbands dont work  the bartenders say they are  out of all the free drinks   so they lied about everything basically  just to get you to go in  the place is not even nice or playing good music  the staff is totally shady and fake  and its tiny  i cant believe i wasted any time visiting this place  please dont make the same mistake 
2 5 stars  review is not on install or his product but on customer service    answered his phone like he was a random person   hello  with kids in the background  thats ok and all but at least reassure the caller that they are calling a company by using a professional statement like  checks epoxy  or something similar  that does not begin the business deal off on a good foot   sent email over a week ago after speaking with him and never received a response back  ekkkk      while he is very friendly and confident in his work  his pricing is on the upper end of all the quotes i have obtained for the same  similar professional epoxy from a company like apf  he leaves the impression that this is a business he runs on the side and not what he makes a living doing  shop around you will find a better deal with the same warranty  quality  grinding service etc 
dr leo odle is very thorough and has a great bedside manner  the group recently moved into a new building and they have a lot more space  wait times are normally very reasonable and never that long after being checked in  i have been a patient for about 4 years now and have no complaints  i have seen the other docs as well and they have a great knowledge base to diagnose peculiar issues that may come up  overall highly recommended 
i thought i had a broken cable  i spoke with the actual repairman  owner bill  he provided a flat upfront cost for the cable and then if it happened to be the spring he also told me that price  there were no surprises and my tenant was impressed by his quick response and professionalism  with better rates than other companies i called i highly recommend affordable garage door service  i did everything over the phone and email  super easy 
the owners are great guys and they know how to make some quality food  i loved the reeses pieces cookie dough treat they gave me  the prices are good and the food is tasty  they have some very creative menu items that are worth trying 
easily the best bagel place in the 6ix  the same owners of fat pasha however they really did a great job with this place  you gotta try the different bagels each time you go  i loved the chubb hubb 
who likes going on walks  runs or bike rides  well i do  i love this ravine because its literally just under me and i can hop out of bed and go on a stroll  this ravine is super long  extensive and will make you work for that meal  always try and bring a friend on a walk  this ravine is a hidden gem 
i thought cracked egg was very good  but not great  good variety and good food  the service wasnt anything to write home about  but nothing to complain about either    i had the peanut butter stuffed french toast  which was tasty but became too sweet to finish    my wife had the chile verde rancheros  she said she will definitely order this again  but it was a portion large enough for her to skip lunch because she was still full    we also shared the coffee cake based on recommendations on yelp  and i would skip it next time  tasted like a cake mix     expect to wait on the weekends  and note that the prices are a little high for a breakfast place  but not crazy  well probably come back  just not every weekend 
staff friendly   overall very clean restaurant  food was fast and great tasting       manager  justin  very upbeat   people person    we will be back    thanks
the packaging was well done  the dry ice froze some of the food  other meal service companies that provide a better product  the  zucchini pasta was good  turkey meatballs were salty  hoping they step up the food quality  all and all below average 
when your second grade student profile in your elementary school  yearbook  says that your favorite song is  ill make love to you  by boyz ii men  i had terribly permissive parents apparently   theres really no way i wouldnt enjoy this  its fairly inexpensive by vegas show standards  and if youre a fan  there you dont need cirque du soleil level spectacle to enjoy yourself   they perform a wide range of songs  from their early hits to motown covers  they even cover a song they say was offered to them and they turned it down  the song went on to win a grammy for the group that ended up recording it  youll have to watch to see which song it is  the only single i didnt hear that i wish i did was four seasons 
what surprises most people when eating korean cuisine for the first time is the banchan    the sides of pickled vegetables and other goodies brought to the table to accompany the meal  its something you didnt expect  and in some respects is like a complimentary appetizer  korean bbq   rolls takes it to the next level  the owners  a delightful husband and wife team  set down two plates with 6 different pickled vegetables  this was  however  preceded by a bowl of creamy chicken soup  after the pickled vegetables came a grilled salmon salad  and finally came pajeon  a thin scallion pancake   and this was all the stuff we didnt pay for  directly   it was all delicious  the salmon was still tender and flaky  a hair overdone  but thats just nitpicking   the kimchi was tart and perfectly seasoned  and homemade    for the main dishes  i was able to sample the bulgogi  pork katsu  they have a japanese flare as well  probably to attract more business   the jap chae  the bibimbap  and the kimchi fried rice  you wont be disappointed with any of those  and likely not with anything else on the menu as well  i ordered the kimchi fried rice  and it is a very flavorful  hearty dish  if youre hungry its a good meal  if not  its two good meals  the bulgogi is some of the best ive ever had  after dinner  we were treated to a cup of sikhye  a sweetened fermented rice drink   delicious  of course    and complimentary  if you like variety  youll get to try around 10 different dishes just for ordering a single entree  itll run you like  12  15  youll also get the best service around  other than ambiance  there is really nothing bad to say about korean bbq   rolls 
came here tonight excited to eat some fish  1 5 hours later and several very rude staff members later i still have no fish  maybe tomorrow when i get the meal i can update you all on how it tasted 
weve recently moved to phoenix and weve been looking for a fantastic indian restaurant  and i think weve found it    the restaurant is nice  with nice decor  the service was friendly and quick  the waiter was a pro and we loved one to ten spicy scale for our dishes  i ordered veggie korma  he got the chicken tikka masala   and we shared some naan and the assorted snacks  vegetable pakora  samosa  sheesh kabab  papadum   everything was delicious  giant food baby  well be back for the lunch buffet and we cant wait 
i waited for a year to write this review as my dealings with this dentist just unfortunately even became worse with the crown he fitted me breaking a part    long story short    i visit this dentist   he recommended a crown and root canal and despite my misgivings about the practice  see previous reviewers comment about their antique x ray machine    went ahead and did the procedure   everything just went wrong after that    the crown never fit right and when i came back for an adjustment   they charged me for the visit  when i asked the receptionist why   she goes in the back   consults   with the dentist and returns to tell me that   usually they would charge me for the return visit but he would do me a one time favor   the nerve    before i even opened the door to get out   he himself comes out to remind me that root canal procedures can go wrong and that since i did acknowledge that  he would recommend a removal if my discomfort continues     for a price  of course   unbelievable    anyway   i walked away with a painful crown   been using sensodyne to calm it down and finally the crown just broke apart   barely after a year 
went here with a  10 off  50 or more coupon  ahead of time i wrote down the prices of all items in the ads on sale that we wanted  it was slightly crowded in any of the food aisles  but this was after church on a sunday  therefore that can be understood  they offered all items that we wanted and are a full grocery store   they dont ad match or take credit cards or bag your groceries  all items that we wanted were cheaper or same price at winco than walmart or the ad prices  there was an exception for a few items such as name brand cereal  coke or pepsi products  russet potatoes 10lbs was  3 49 vs ad of  1 49  that was the biggest differential i found  steaks and ground beef was over priced    with that said  we spent over  100 and were very pleased with everything  just have to know to shop elsewhere for select few items  also beware of the community drums of food  health hazard with kids and peoples dirty hands all over that stuff  stick with the tall cylinders or pre packaged items   we will be doing most of our grocery shopping there from now on  they must of had 12 15 check out lanes open  no wait at all  how nice  great store overall  
went here in a group  i got the turkey club sandwich  it was good while the french fries were hot but nothing special  others got breakfast    service was good and all the food came out together    overall real good place to go to for lunch or breakfast with average prices 
here is the short version  awesome best chinese food in arizona with super fast carryout and short to the point  cold phone etiquette   i drive past two other chinese places to get food from here  when i call to place the order i already have my shoes on and once i hang up i immediately leave  they usually say 10 or 15 minutes but the food is always waiting on me when i get there 10 minutes after i hang up  you better be ready to order once you call  a guy who answers is nicer than the female  but they all have a accent  they will only ask you for your phone number and what you want  then say  10 minute   they are very short and to the point   ive never sat down to eat there so i cant comment on that   you walk up to counter  pay and walk out  not much to it  but the food is awesome  only place that has chicago size larger egg rolls  for some reason places dont carry them out here 
service was fast and friendly  prices were high  beef no cheese or peppers is now  7 50  beef was cold and not dipped as i requested  flavor was ok  but maybe thats because im now spoiled by portillos  fries are great  i wont be back for a beef but would for a hot dog 
if you want five star quality food for high five star prices  this is the place for you  you definitely get what you pay for  this is not one of those expensive seafood steak houses where they charge an arm and a leg and the food is average  all the food is of high quality and tasted amazing  they give you complementary bread and butter  the waitresses and the busboys all very friendly and all english speaking  this restaurant gives you the feeling that they take care of their employees  and pay them well enough to have good people working there   i ordered the 8 ounce flame mignon steak that was  39  it was by far the best steak i have ever had  they offered to butterfly the steak to spread it out and i think that helped make it amazing  i cant wait to return 
2 5 stars   entered and place is small  has 3 sitting rooms  no music so if you have a older couple right by you who don t talk like we did  they just sit and listen to you  creepy  not a good place to sit and talk without many people hearing you as its super quiet   anyways we sat for 5 10 mins no server so no drinks  in the end we had 3 tables sit after us  eat    leave before us  so maybe our slow service was an anomaly   after finally getting our food  french toast arrived without syrup  really  yep    waitress was nice and kept coffee full  food was slow to come out   eggs   bacon on the side were cold  eggs are better at home than here  french toast was good but not amazing  i would try pancakes next time    overall it was ok  but not anything i would die to come back for   to wash hands you have to leave the restaurant and walk across the parking lot as thats where the restrooms are located  not convenient 
brought in my imac that i bought in 2008 to get help at the genius bar  i made an online appt  i could not figure out why when i added a new contact on my iphone and tried to sync it with my computer that the contacts on the imac were never updated  they provided all the cords  mouse  and keyboard  all i had to do was bring my ac and iphone in   the genius was very nice and helpful  after about 10 minutes i walked out with all my contacts on my phone and imac both the same  it was a problem i had by adding new contacts to yahoo rather than the icloud   the hardest thing for the genius to do was figure out how to get my old contacts from yahoo onto my imac  he had to download a vcard and then i approved them to be merged hoping it would work  and it did  even the genius said i had an unusual problem   that is why i love apple  i have a product from 2008 out of warranty and yet i still get free help on it  way to go   that is how a company retains customers 
i am most likely not your average reviewer when it comes to las vegas  it was my first time at the las vegas hilton and my first time in las vegas all together      i enjoyed staying at the hilton   it was a little tacky for a hilton hotel  but it was nice   the room was large  great nights sleep  great view  amazing bathroom huge tub   the staff was amazing   the shops were fun   the restaurants had good food  but could use improved service   the whole place was incredibly clean   and i highly recommend the spa  a great experience   also  there is a shuttle that takes you directly to the strip 
the food was delicious and there was excellent customer service  i would definitely eat there again  very classy and great atmosphere 
i stumbled in here looking for a cheap and quick meal  and was pleasantly surprised  all food is under 10 dollar and pretty decent  dont expect any culinary surprises  but their pho and rice dishes are flavorful and more than worth the money 
fun candy warehouse to shop while visiting cleveland  some large bulk packages were overpriced  they had a nice easter candy section  also bought some specialty sodas 
had a phenomenal dinner last month at bistro 185  i could not find something to complain about if i tried  delicious and fresh  we will be back here for sure 
horrible sandwiches  got our orders all wrong  and the bread was all soggy  not recommended
first time trying a local foot spa  and to no regrets  in fact  it was the best full body massage ive ever had  and ive gone to many luxury and hotel spas in las vegas    me  my boyfriend  and his brother all came in as walk in s 8 oclock on a monday night  we were quickly accomdated with enough massage specialists to have us out the door at the same time  i requested 60min and my person focused on every part of my body in an even amount of time with perfect pressure    you do not remove your clothes here  so i recommend coming in wearing a tank and shorts so they can make the most contact over your clothes  price was only  35  i will definitely be a repeat monthly customer 
dr  nahin and his nurse jennifer are great  it was a two month wait to see him as a new patient   so though that was daunting  he was very easy to talk to about concerns i had  after doing research of doctors in las vegas  i chose dr  nahin because of his great reviews and speciality in diabetes  it runs in my family so i had specific concerns regarding that    the docked star off has nothing to do with dr  nahin  more so  just piggybacking on the comments regarding the gals at the front desk  first off  the placement of the check in desk in the lobby is extremely awkward because of the chairs right in front  so its impossible to form any sort of line without invading the space of the person in front of you  which i dont like doing at clinics due to private information being exchanged    the gals dont seem warm or welcoming  lighten up  people most always dont see doctors for great reasons  so the least you can do as the first face we see in your office is offer a smile  great customer service would be a delightful bonus     im additionally peeved that one of the girls mentioned the quest lab in their office was open on saturday mornings  when i showed up on a saturday  the security informed me that theyre closed and always closed on saturdays  __  sort of a huge lapse in information from the front desk  dont ya think 
from the moment i walked in i felt comfortable and welcomed  the store is clean  bright and modern  theres lots of places to sit in the waiting area  it wasnt busy when i got there so i was seen right away  i will be going back for sure 
i placed a time sensitive order from their web store at the beginning of june  when the items hadnt arrived by the end of the month i attempted contact with the business  no live person answered the phone and the messages went unanswered  much to my surprise  the items arrived 2 months after the order was placed   there were spiderwebs inside the packaging and it seems that the box had been sitting for awhile     i cant speak to the quality of their training but customer service    support from the store is severely lacking     shipping confirmation was received about 7 weeks after the order was placed  
i am so fortunate to have found detox salon   ive been going to the same stylist for 15 years but needed a change for a variety of reasons   i was nervous to try someplace new   every time i received a personal review for a salon  id check the yelp reviews and they didnt agree   or id see a place with great yelp reviews and hear personally from someone who had a bad experience at the salon   i found detox through yelp  the reviews were great but it was the pictures that sold me  the final products were all wonderful   while it was close to home and looked like a cool concept  all natural  no toxins  clean and unique interior   i was nervous to try  a place without knowing anyone personally that had been there   i threw caution to the wind and called to schedule   the woman i spoke to  super sweet and helpful  by the way  recommended cat   from the minute i met cat i knew id made the right decision   she knew exactly what to recommend for my hair   she was also extremely personable and fun to talk to   then i saw the final product and i was blown away  i love my hair   love the color  cant even figure out how she was able to get it so perfect    love the cut  its improved but doesnt make me look like someone totally different   just love love love it   i was so excited i already booked my next appointment to return   i cant recommend this salon enough   its comfortable and clean and the stylists and staff are second to none   thanks  cat   i love it and cant wait to come back 
went here for the first time this weekend and i will definitely be back    very cute and open decor with a large friendly staff   there was a little bit of a wait when we arrived but it was worth it    from there signature drinks to take on brunch  i think this place is definitely sticking around   i had just an original mimosa w  oj but they offer many other juices to mix   for my entree  i opted for the snooze spuds deluxe  a heaping portion of our hash browns  covered with melted cheddar   jack cheese  scallions plus two veggies   meats  or combo of your choice   taken directly from their menu  so good and our service was fantastic    i would eat here every morning if i could 
i am writing this review based on what just occured between my co worker and the supposed manager of this restaurant  my coworker ordered pho  take out  and when she opened the container and sifted through the pho  there was a bug  to anyone this has happened to  or even if it hasnt  this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food   she called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money  when the  manager  told her they didnt want her business and it wasnt their problem   this is absolutely unacceptable   and it gets worse  my co worker went back with another co worker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in  the container cracked  opened and the bag was filled with the pho  to which the manager said  yelled to them   get that sh t out of here  i dont want it   he proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant   while other customers were present   that is how you run your business  yelling and swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden      get the hell out of here   disgusting  and i  along with many many many employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant   will never be back   you are trash for speaking to a customer this way    so if in fact the manager was involved with this encounter  i hope your doors soon close  and if this happened to be an employee posing as a manger  then i hope you lose your job and the real manager make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process 
seriously    i went through the drive thru again and knew i should have just went someplace else as every time we have been here our order was wrong   this time takes the cake  i went thru drive thru and placed order    tried to order  chicken tacos  and the girl said we are all out of those   i asked her how can you be out of chicken tacos at 5pm    she said sorry we are   i said cancel order and started to drive out  i then decided to get the managers card and complain   the cashier went back to the office and retrieved the managers card which i decided to call from the car   dayania ortega picked up the phone and i let her know i was not happy  she decided to lecture me saying i didnt order correctly and should have said the fried chicken tacos  i asked her if maybe the girl at the window should have asked and she told me no because they have such a large menu   as she was lecturing me on how to correctly  order the  fried chicken tacos   i again pulled into drive thru and identified the fried chicken tacos as manager ortega had told me according to proper procedure at el pollo loco   after ordering the exact way she told me the window girl again said sorry we are out of those       i said no the fried chicken tacos  and she said yes sir we are out of them  are you f   ing kidding me      to top it off ms  ortega got on the mic and said we can make them for you but it will be a wait   this restaurant is the worse i have ever been too  which really sucks as when they get the food right it is good   i am shocked that they are able to stay in business as this seems to be the norm at the summerlin or just outside of summerlin location    no use complaining to corporate office as ms  ortega said it just comes back here anyway  lmfao  i am still in awe     
i found this pedicure shop on yelp and based on the reviews gave them a try   i ended up being very disappointed   the nail polish selection was ill kemp and disorganized   the seating at the foot dryer were  10 ikea chairs and not something i wanted to sit on   it is true  they do offer disposable liners but you dont get massage jets as the liners are placed in plastic foot baths within the spa   they put a mud mask on my legs that they left far too long and it ended up burning the backs of my calves 
horrible experience  someone broke into my room while i was sleeping and stole my things  there is no security at this hotel im never coming back 
nice museum  i love the variety in the different floors  spend about 3 hours here  but could easily spend another hour  food at the cafe is good  if you have time left  its a good way to spend it here 
my go to place when im craving for a good steak  i usually get the bacon wrapped shrimp and chopped salad as an appetizer  they are amazing  then for the star of the show  the bone in ribeye steak  it is so tender and very flavorful that is if you dont mind a good marble on  your steak  if not do the lean cut and tender filet mignon  the charred sweet corn and creamed spinach for sides are must try as well  but the best part of the dinner are the long time servers that makes us feel special  always attentive and top notch service  we will be back again 
steaks were off the charts good  but wow the prices hurt  visit after you win big 
waste of thousands of dollars  i had 1 speeding ticket     1  the secretary caused my attorney to completely miss my court date   2  after they finally did represent me in court  they never called me to inform me of my case   3  i had to keep calling for updates  i never knew what was going on with my case unless i constantly called them to ask   4  when i would finally talk to them for an update  it was never good news  they would say  two weeks ago when we went to court  this  happened       and i was completely unaware of what was going on at all times   5  they promised to get my speeding ticket off my record     its still on my record 6  i have no idea how they are rated as  top traffic attorneys in the area  because this is the worst and most expensive service i have ever gotten        you might as well save your  1700 and represent yourself in court  
the first time i came here i got a facial done by kayla  i absolutely loved it and have been going over a year now seeing kayla every time  everyone in this store is very passionate about their work and the products and amazing customer service  they also give the best advise when it comes to skin products for all skin types  i have learned so many dos and donts from everyone here  skin bar is a very good quality salon and worth every penny  you only have one body so better take care of it  skin bar has taken good care of my face for over a year and i have had amazing results   
i have never stayed here myself but i did do some exploring around to see what they had to offer   this is my story   walking up to the hotel you see all these bright lights that are characteristic of vegas   once you get in  you see that the lights are there to blind you so that you do not see the how dirty  crappy and run down it is inside   went the an event at their carnaval  sp   and had an okay time      cover was decent and bartenders were crazy with the drinks  thats the one star    went on the dance floor and noticed security snuffing out anyone having fun   seriously  security needs to take a giant step back   i had some skeezy guy come up to me  which is normal i suppose  and security did nothing even though he was right there and i was vocalizing my distaste while being called a bitch by said skeez ball   i see a crowd next to me having fun and getting rowdy with some friendly moshing and security jumps on them   dude the guy on stage was stage diving and you expect people in the crowd not to start moshing or carrying people on their shoulder   ridiculous   so just remember if youre looking to have fun  security will stop you   if youre looking to rape someone or get raped  feel free to do so   this place sucks ass   if i had some super powers that would let me destroy this place i would 
i just moved to carnegie and was looking for a good pizza joint  i put my order in for a chefs salad and fried mushrooms and after over an hour wait time i was less than excited about what i got  the mushrooms were soaking wet the first one i bit into had so much liquid i nearly choked  the salad when i first opened it was literally just cheese i poured on the dressing and shook it up and when i opened it back up it was 60  meat 30  cheese and 10  veggies  while most people wouldnt complain i was little upset having to throw away what felt like a pound of meat because theres no way any human can handle that much in one sitting  i cant comment on their pizzas or customer service as i ordered online  but from my single experience its not something i plan on doing anytime soon  maybe ill try again in a few months if other places dont pan out 
what an awesome  awesome place   went here with my mom for a casual friday lunch and really enjoyed it   the bread and pesto are amazing   the reason i am giving 4 stars is because the menu is a little too funky for my taste  i am more a fan of the basics   the dessert menu is also amazing  and all of the desserts are made in house that day   definitely recommend for a nice lunch or dinner  and make sure to get dessert 
we visited this location on monday night  at the end of the long labor day weekend   upon entering  around the same time as another individual  it was clear that it had been a slow day by the amount of ready food and there was only 1 other patron in the store 3 of us in total    within 30 seconds of my arriving  numerous others came in and the store was  slammed    by the time i completed my order  the line was out the door and the kitchen was scrambling   alex  who appeared to be a manager of some sort  took orders efficiently and was effective in delegating the the kitchen and other staff how to work this situation quickly   under pressure  she kept her composure  and did so with a smile and positive attitude   kudos to alex and the rest of the team for handling a tough situation   my food was excellent and i really only had to wait about 5 mins 
i love this place  its been on my bucket list for over a year and one day  while driving to a different destination  we came upon this pinball hall of fame   not what you think it would be   go inside this fairly plain 1 story building and youll find 100s of operating pinball machines   one giant arcade   i found the pinball machine i loved in the 80s  the machines have cards describing the pinball machine and its year   i played some pretty old pinball machines that day  i am definitely going back when i can spend more time there   dont worry about being an adult in a pinball arcade   almost everyone there was an adult   they have a change machine for convenience  easy parking 
im thankful that ive met chase   this was my first psychic reading  card and palm    the reading gave me some understanding and clarity regarding some personal aspects of my life   it made me reflect on some of my own tendencies that regardless if i mean well  my presentation or communication is just one aspect  others reception and perception is another   this allowed me to be more mindful and have that extra layer of sensitivity towards how others might take things  i believe people try to be and do the best they can based on what they know or how they think they know how   i do the best i can with the best of intentions   this experience helped shed some light and brought awareness on how i express myself and it will definitely help me improve   we dont have control over other people but we have control over our actions   in my case  i need to be a bit more mindful  having the awareness  i can be better and i want to be the best version of myself that i can be     chase was also accurate as far as my past and how i am as a person even on some things that i dont share with others   it made me feel understood and not all that alone   the greatest value for me out of this experience was gaining a different perspective and understanding   i highly recommend   thank you  chase 
if you are moving and need a place to store  this is definitely it  never rented a unit before but from the first phone call to coming in and signing for my unit  this team has been absolutely wonderful  i had so many questions and marizela and keith were so helpful and pleasant walking me through the whole process   service is great  prices are very reasonable  i highly recommend this place 
best fing pizza in vegas  no doubt  i am from jersey and have a definite stereo type about pizza  carmines is the bomb pizza of vegas 
best carne asada and pastor buritto that ive ever had   i prefer no cabbage and its amazing for only  5 50  accept cash only     i live far from this spot but drive out here weekly from ne mesa 
1  they do not have a phone  if there is a fire no one can call 911 2  their sign says they take walkins  they do not 3  the people at the front desk are rude 4  the wait time for a walk in is 60 90 minutes  which at 430pm means you can get in at 830pm   thats not 60 90 minutes      5  prices are inflated  significantly higher from their other locations  6  no just dont waste your time
after having to cancel my application at another apartment complex  i called elysian west and spoke with alysha   i explained that i was moving from out of state and had come to las vegas to see apartments a few weeks before  and had seen a sister property  elysian at the district  but was more interested in being on the west side of town  so elysian west was a better location for me   selecting an apartment from 1300 miles away is not easy  but alysha made the process entirely smooth   she answered all of my questions  and even sent me a map of the property indicating where available apartments were located   the application and lease process was extremely easy  and when i arrived in town  they had everything ready for me to move in   the amenities in this complex cannot be beat  even though some are still works in progress   especially the gym  included media package  and the huge dog park and grassy area surrounding it   the layout is very spacious and has so much storage that i had way more space than i needed   the finishes in the apartment are modern and everything is well put together     at every turn  the girls in the office have made this experience a great one   i had some issues setting up my cox cable account  and they were quick to fix everything to make sure i had all of the right services and setup was ready for me when i moved in   each question or concern i have had has been addressed quickly and with a smile   i highly recommend this complex if you are looking for somewhere comfortable  with great amenities and a friendly staff 
i cannot recommend this company enough   i moved from across the country in may 2015 and have now used them 3 times  unloading a pod into a large 2 story house  moving into a storage unit  and moving from storage into a 2nd floor apartment    ann in the office is great to work with  she is flexible  and does her best to accommodate every request   the guys are incredibly hard workers  even in middle of the day in the summer heat  and get the job done quickly without any complaints   in my 3 moves  i have had 2 different crews  and all of the guys were great  personable and made the moving process very smooth   in 3 moves  i had only 1 item that was damaged  and they made it right immediately   if you are looking for a moving company  this is the one to go with   i will be using them for my next move  and recommend them to anyone who needs help moving in the las vegas area 
we love the place   dont hesitate to try this place   the food was very good and great sevice  love love love
everything ive gotten is delicious  the croque madame is delicious  savory and cheesy  the burger melts in your mouth  the hand cut fries are good too  they always have fresh teas and limeaide 
last minute choice turned out pretty good  some nice people gave us their two for one coupon so we paid only  20 18 for brunch  the selection was okay for the price   dessert was good  vanilla chocolate and mint gelato  selfish 
i ordered food from grand pizza for a large group of people we spent over  80 00   in this order there were 4 orders of 12 chicken wings   i opened my chicken wing box and found a chicken wing that still had veins and feathers on it   the rest of our party immediately lost their appetite and did not want to eat the rest of the wings for fear that the unsanitary  not cleaned properly chicken wing had come into contact with the other wings at some point in time   i called grand pizza and spoke with the most uncooperative and rude employee named ali   he told me that  its just one wing i dont see the problem  i can only give you store credit for one order of wings  and finally  maam the wing is not unsanitary its fried in high temperatures that kill the bacteria just take it out    i informed ali that i would not accept store credit because i would never order food from there again   i asked him if all the wings were in one container together before being fried and sauced and he said yes we dont have frozen wings   i then tried to explain that the other wings were not going to be eaten because they were at one point in time in the same container as the unsanitary one   i asked for a refund on all the wings which was about  25  30 of out order of over  80 and he refused   i asked for mangers names and contact information and he said  call back tomorrow after 10 am  and then hung up   i was a ride and upsetting experience since we were trying to feed a party of 8 adults and 4 of them were not able to eat their orders   i do not recommend grand pizza
falyn is awesome   get the fish tacos grilled and add another shrimp taco   total chill place 
i love the lazy river and the condo style rooms  the staff are very respectful and helpful  we really enjoyed booze and bites restaurant  bar as well  good beer and the island sale is the bomb   the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the enforcing of the rules by the teenage lifeguards at the lazy river  they are afraid to tell the guests not to horseplay or run around the lazy river   another drawback is that 3 days in a row either the pool or lazy river was completely shutdown due to biohazards which means someone defecated or vomited in the water  totally gross 
my partner and i will stay at the linq any and every time we visit vegas    linq seems to really cater to the younger crowd  which i loved  the price is right and the rooms are gorgeous  the linq is located perfectly in the heart of all the big daddy casinos    they have awesome restaurants  bars and shops located conveniently inside    my only complaint is  parking    finding our room after parking in the garage every time was brutal   also  during my stay  the parking garage flooded while under a  flash flood warning  i knew nothing about    be careful 
my friend brought me here for breakfast and coffee  its such a nice place to dine al fresco with beautiful weather  they have healthy options  i ordered a cappuccino with a spinach wrap and fruit on the side  my friend ordered some pastry  it was surprisingly delicious and well crafted  great place to chat and people watch  next time i need to try their pastries and desserts 
first time here with the boyfriend and i had the matcha green tea crepe cake since the photos on yelp made it look amazing  it was delicious and a light cake  i also had a nonfat matcha green tea latte  i love matcha green tea anything lol  my guy had the chocolate cake dessert which was sweet and rich  very yummy  will be back  kind of hard to find since its located in the back of a strip plaza shared with a vietnamese restaurant 
i love green tea macarons   i love green tea ice cream   omg i love both combined with some black sesame ice cream   cute spot  i have yet to try other flavors now that i have a stamp card  nice decor and late hours  will be back   
ive been to black bears throughout california and this one was not nearly as good as the others     the biscuits were hard and dry and i just was not that happy with our breakfast here    the portions are still crazy big but the quality of food and what you pay more just arent what i had expected     if you are going to be a chain restaurant of sorts  everything should be consistent and this location is definitely not compared to others    
my mom  my son   myself stayed here for a night   the location is fantastic   everything one could imagine is within a 1 2 mile radius   food  groceries  gas  etc   we did not eat breakfast here so i cannot comment on that    the beds  although they claim they were doubles  were nothing more than a slightly over sized twin  my son   i could barely sleep comfortably     very quiet though considering its right off of greenway   17     a decent value 
four friends and i were vacationing in las vegas and decided to try out the seafood buffet inside of rio   we went sunday evening  january 11  2015  as a last taste of great buffets before leaving for home monday morning   wow were we all greatly disappointed  everything was just ok at best  with many items not worthy of human consumption   the crab legs and oysters looked and tasted old and stale  the lobster tails were bland  almost if they had been sitting in fresh water for a week before cooking   and the shrimp were just not good   very disappointing  especially for the  50 price tag   there are much better places to eat in vegas 
dinner in paris    las vegas that is     came here for dinner one beautiful evening in las vegas    we were greeted by the hostess and was seated immediately   we placed our orders    i had their house specialty the chicken pesto penne  omg    the creamy chicken penne with pesto was sooo delicious  roasted chicken  sun dried tomatoes tossed in a light pesto cream sauce    need i say more  yummy  came with a loaf of bread and two breadsticks with dipping oil to start you off  even sweeter deal that we used a groupon offer and our whole dinner was free  sweet  keith was our waiter and he was an awesome  elderly gentleman  couldnt have asked for a more pleasant evening   the restaurant is located inside paris hotel and casino serving french italian cuisine and occasionally the servers  dressed in traditional french peasant garb  would break into song and perform throughout the night at this casual bistro   the setting is old european village of the french countryside with walls covered in murals   review  0127
observation deck  after visiting las vegas numerous times we finally had the chance to go up to the tower of the stratosphere  stratosphere can boast of its unique 1 149 foot tall vegas resort structure and is the tallest freestanding observation tower in all of las vegas and probably in all of u s  we just dont go this way too much as we mostly stay on the other end of the strip    we were able to get spectacular 360 degree views of sin city and the strip by day and by night from their indoor as well as their outdoor observation decks  the indoor deck has an angled window and it does have warning signs posted throughout to not lean on the window    um  you wouldnt want to find out why those signs are posted  they are there for a reason  the outdoor observation decks have viewfinder scopes available to use and scan the city through the lens  the panoramic views were amazing at that height    especially at night with all the lights   prior to boarding the elevators you will go through a security screening where you empty your pockets or they check your purse  backpack and go through a metal detector  after you pass that then you wait once again on the same line to get your photo taken  optional to purchase   once thats done then you go up a another escalator to board the elevator that will take you to the observation decks    have a cocktail or two at the highest bar in sin city  airbar  we enjoyed a margarita in our tall plastic drinking tower  yummy   before heading up the tower why not purchase tickets to the thrill rides and have an experience like no other  see my separate review http     www yelp com  biz  stratosphere thrills las vegas hrid 1lcyl9gla83brlnkybtklq utm_source oshare   enjoy   review  0461
karaoke place  i didnt order anything fancy  i had the classic all american burger    it was good and i loved the fries  service was okay  a little slow  at almost 10 00p  but our waitress was nice and friendly   it was a karaoke place and some of the karaoke participants were good    the mc wasnt too good  though     somewhat corny  im sorry     this restaurant is located in the circus circus casino  confusing parking area  has 3 sections   also  this was a groupon deal    it was okay for what i paid for   review  0133
yummy but expensive  this wasnt my first time here at this ben   jerrys located inside the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood resort   casino which is at the heart of the las vegas strip  it is right around where the rainstorm show is that comes on at scheduled times during the day   the ice cream is good but yikes  pricey    i guess its because of the expensive rent for having a space inside the miracle mile shops  for three large scoops  two on waffle cones  was  26 15  not including tax   we applied our discount from the free miracle mile shops coupon book that we picked up at the information center  still  the total came out to  18 26 for three ice creams with the coupon  without the discount wouldve been  28 31  really   almost 30 bucks for ice cream   next time i just need to find me a walmart and get me the 16 oz pint size for less than  5  i can do without the waffle cone    just hand me a spoon     there are seating available outside of the shop and you can watch the rainstorm show while enjoying your ice cream  during weekends  friday and saturday  it comes on every 30 minutes  no show on sundays   review  0911
we ordered from this place through delicious deliveries and it was great  my husband and i loved the tacos and the black beans were delish    will definitely be going back soon 
i am the manager of a self storage office in scottsdale and nick   his crew recently moved a customer in and out of a unit  they were super nice and showed great care of moving the items on and off their truck  even though it was quite hot outside  they kept up and finished the move a little ahead of schedule  i would highly recommend experienced movers to future customers looking for a reliable  caring moving company  keep up the awesome work em  
i have used this service about a dozen times and it has always been great  the price is as low as you can get and easy to use   the drivers are always very nice and talk with you as much or as little as you want         when i arrive in phoenix  i walk out to the middle aisle and tell the rep  where i am headed and usually within 10 minutes i am off  i call a day in advance for pickup to airport and the drivers are usually early  but never late     great deal 
this place is horrible    doctor is so rude and pushy   i went in to see if i was a good candidate for the marina  i am 25 years old and  married with two kids  when a doctor met with me she started by saying  and i quote  the marina was a good option if you decide not to have kids for five years  but that if you are only getting it for a year because  it was convenient  then i will not let you get it because there are other women at there that will actually use it for the time needed   do you understand where i am coming from   then she continued by explaining the side effects saying   you will spot for about 6 months so just be patient  after thats you will get very light to no periods  so i said  im not very comfortable with not getting my period for five years  could i possibly look into the paragard  and she snapped saying  yeah well the paragard is for 12 years  and i dont think you are planning on not having kids for 12 years  are you   and then  even said  i think that once you get out of your 1920s mentality of not having a period being bad thing i think youd really get to enjoy this birth control    wow   so disrespectful   i couldnt believe she was talking to me as if i was a child trying to bum off    and not a grown ass women who knows her body and what might be best for her  not to mention i was still paying    will not be coming here again
ive been to jt boba a couple of times   the boba is good   pricy but good    the women who takes the orders seems to always have an attitude and can be rude and unwelcoming  i asked for an extra cup to share with my son and one of the guy workers was very kind and handed it to me but before it could even be out of my sight the owner  women who takes the orders  scold me about giving me a cup   i thought that was a bit unprofessional and not to mention embarrassing for the guy  the other time i went i got a large thai tea boba i took maybe 3 sips of it before my 1 year old pulled the straw and it fell on the floor  when i went to let them know that i spilled my drink the women looked annoyed that that had happened and even bothered by the fact that they had to clean it up   what bothered me the most is she didnt even offer to refill it or even give another at discount  its all about costumer service   you want your want your customers to feel welcomed and appreciated for their service  everywhere that ive been where ive accidentally spilled a drink or dropped it they were always kind enough to either refill it or give me another at a discount  especially if it was an accident caused by a one year old   i will not be coming here again 
im stuck between a 3 4 stars   i ordered deliver from here today for the first time   the young man who answered was very polite and had great service  i ordered spring rolls  combination pad thai and chicken fried rice   the food was delivered quickly    however  it wasnt what i expected   the pad thai was a little bland   and the spring rolls were plain also   everything came out to 36 dollars   with tip to about 41  which seemed a bit pricy to me   only because ive been to places where it wasnt as pricy for good quality food   i am however willing to give this place another try   i dont think i would order the pad thai or rolls again 
horrible nachos  the chips were so old they felt like cardboard when i chewed on them   pasta was pretty basic too  the food is nothing like the pictures in their menu   is it ever   lol    even though the older boston pizza at sheppard center was notorious for their rude staff  the staff here were fairly polite  however please dont eat here  or eat at your own risk  the draught heinken was okay too 
i think they have every bridal shoe you can find online all conveniently located in this store and what they dont have they are willing to order for you with no hassle  their prices are average on most things  i was actually expecting a lot more in the way of accessories  guest books  pens  cake toppers  etc    they did have an okay selection to choose from but i guess i expected a little more from a place calling itself a  superstore   the attire half of this shop was pretty decent though  they appeared to have an acceptable amount of bridal and wedding party dresses in the store  im glad i stopped here  because i got to try on shoes and my mom got a shirt that said mother of the bride  but that was pretty overpriced at  40 for a cotton t shirt with rhinestones on it  actually  being that we found my moms dress for the wedding on clearance at jc penneys  the shirt cost more then the dress  customer service was okay  but i had a heck of a time hunting down someone who wasnt busy doing something to help me out 
been twice now  both times it was consistant in service and food  the menu isnt huge  but they are always open so you cant expect it to be  good cheap greasy diner food  the area is kinda scary  and the place could probably use some new decor  but considering the traffic that i am sure it has gotten in the many years its been open im willing to overlook it 
love rose nails   my mom my sister and i have been going to them for 9 years  they are great  my gel polish and pedicures always look amazing  rose also does such a great job on my eyebrows  i would recommend this place to everyone on the southwest side of town 
magical  food is excellent  my manhattan was also off the charts    some variation had me thoroughly impressed  cool crowd and nice waitresses
ive been here a couple times and have enjoyed it  the people are friendly  the service is quick  the all you can eat portion sizes are perfect  you can sample a variety of rolls appetizers  etc  my favorite roll is the o m g roll  the spice and acidity of the roll was in perfect combination with the sweet and savory flavor  cute atmosphere too 
this place is great  dont know why its only three stars  weve only been to the bar so maybe its on the restaurant side  food is good especially for the price  taquitos get the taquitos and the carne asada fries are a good grab too  street tacos are okay lol  nancy the bartender is great too she makes her own drinks and is very attentive  love this place check it out well the bar area for sure  good food great drinks 
came on the two days before the new years  apparently they were having a crazy sale  buy one get one on basically every type of clothes   sweaters  vests  t shirts  casual and dress shirts  it was crazy  and great brands too  we will definitely be going back all the time 
would definitely come back  was very impressed by the menu choices  came here for restaurant week  i enjoyed every last bit of each course  its definitely pricey  but id say well worth it  staff was attentive and food came out at a reasonable time  i read previous reviews that said they waited  i did not have this experience   was very pleased and will be back 
ordered take out from here  food was amazing  everything taste wise was perfect and prices are reasonable  crab rangoon  spring rolls  pad thai  crab fried rice  generous portions and great flavor  no complaints  looking forward to ordering from here again 
ok  so this place is literally a big tin shed  but thats not the issue  theres only one guy working the whole place  and everything is a bit overpriced for being an open box store  i came here thinking id find a cheap couch  but there was nothing under  500  and that was for an outdated  stained piece of furniture that looked like it was picked up off the side of the road  dont get me wrong  if i had a couple thousand dollars to spend on a nice couch  there were a few pieces i would have loved    overall  i cant tell if this place sells used or new furniture  or both  but either way  dont think youll be getting a deal if you come here 
if im int he mood for a good italian sub  i come to jersey mikes  not only do they slice all of the deli meat right in front of you  but the ingredients are always fresh  there are locations all over the valley  but this review is for the camelback  central restaurant  the staff was extremely friendly  the place was clean  and i got a free cookie just for checking in    overall  jersey mikes is where you should go if you want an italian sub  wayyyy better than subway
make sure you book this restaurant right away     our server troy was friendly and helpful   my husband and i ordered the porterhouse for two which was cooked perfectly and had a delicious light sauce  on the bottom of the plate   we had the creamless creamed corn and mushrooms   but not just plain old mushrooms  exotic and delicious mushrooms which included hen of the woods   this was probably right up there in the 5 bets meals we have ever had  period     our server troy suggested that i start off with a french martini  it was made with vodka  chambord  pineapple juice and splash of champagne floating on top   it was the most delicious drink i have ever had   we loved the open kitchen  it was clean and the smells coming from it were fantastic   we will definitely go back  this is not your run of the mill steak house 
nobody is here and i have been waiting 20 minutes to do a wire transfer that only a banker on one of the offices can do  apparently  their tellers cant do it  smh 
great staff and service  food is good but hot dogs are large  large enough to split with two  very unique style of hot dogs  buffalo chicken chowder is amazing 
i attempted to go back to bww y with my brother in law who wanted some good wings  we showed up and the location is now closed  wtf  fail   
3 5 stars  i went to crackers and debated on whether to get a lunch item or breakfast   i ended up going with a lunch item    i went with the roast beef avocado melt  the sandwich was very good and hearty  the side of fries seemed a bit small in portion and little over salted    prices are resonable for a sandwich and side  soup  fries  salad   7 99 8 99  the burger options run about the same price   the menu offers lots of options sandwiches  burgers  salads  half soup  sandwich etc   breakfast items are served all day  everday which is always a nice thing  i plan on heading back to try the breakfast since many people say this is a good spot for breakfast items 
stopped by for some drinks at loco patron  the margaritas were great and brought to the table quickly   service was great  it was nice hanging with friends and having a drink during a wonderful february day out on the patio  i just wish the drinks were slightly cheaper 
i had my first dining experience at classic italian  prior to last night  i always had carry out since i lived around the corner   we ordered the gourmet salad and we all thought the miso dressing just didnt go with this salad  that was the opinion of all 3 of us at the table   the real reason we went here is for the pizza  of course  we werent disappointed  the toscana was awesome  i ate almost the entire pizza myself  the salami  olives  cheese and crust were perfect   the basil  garlic  cheese  cant recall the name  was also very good    the service was okay  after the pizza arrived  we didnt see the server again to refill our water  the place wasnt very busy  with just a few tables full    want a good homemade  fresh pizza  look no further than classic italian 
ive used midas in the past in ca for oil changes and brakes   this is my first midas experience in the tempe area   my truck was due for an oil change and tire rotation  i went in without an appointment and i was told the process would take about 30 minutes  there was another car already getting an oil change  i was glad i got in when i did  shortly after i arrived  four more folks came in for an oil change   the wait time was about 2 hours when the last guy came in   unless you get there when midas opens  you may want to schedule an appointment to have your oil changed or take the chance your oil change may take several hours    during the oil change  the service agent notified of a possible issue with my truck  he showed me the issue when the truck was on the lift and tires being rotated  i was appreciative that he told me to keep an eye on the problem  there was no pressure to fix the issue on the spot   staff was friendly and helpful 
bison and witches is a bar and deli just off mill  i stopped in with a group of 5 to have a bite to eat and some drinks  the atmosphere is casual with a younger crowd  at least the night i went  i enjoyed the music playing  which was lithium on xm   there was a modest amount of people there at 7 30 pm on a tuesday     there is a wide variety of sandwich options to go with as well as a full bar and several beers on tap  all pints were  3  a pretty good deal  there are other specials each night  i ordered the philly for dinner  when the waitress asked me what bread i wanted  i was a bit shocked   ive never had a philly not on a roll    when i got the sandwich  the sandwich was huge  i would estimate 10 inches long and very wide   the sandwich was well done  the bread nicely toasted  but could have used more meat with such large slices of bread  with any sandwich  you get to choose your choice of poore bros  chips  bonus    i enjoy poore bros chips  especially the bbq ranch that  ive only found at dillys and no place else   now i know of another location   my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and although he liked his sandwich  he felt there could have been less bread or given more chicken  i think his chicken filled about half the bread   the waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs for several hours   there is a small patio outside and several tv s to see a game or watch espn highlights   3 5 stars 
ive gone to great clips a few times in the past  but this was my first experience in arizona  i was willing to give them a try  especially with a coupon on hand    i waited about 5 minutes before the stylist saw me  upon entering  i thought the wait was going to be longer as several folks were waiting  fortunately for me  all the stylists wrapped up their customers at the same time    i was seated in the chair and the stylist asked how i wanted my hair cut  she promptly did what i asked  she did a great job and was very happy with my haircut  the stylist was very pleasant and had a nice conversation  but not to the point she talked my ear off     i was in and out within about 15 to 20 minutes  ill take that anyday 
im a big fan of 5 guys and was excited when a location was opening up near my home   im glad 5 guys has been making their way out west and in the phoenix area  first in mesa and tempe and now in south phoenix   i was familiar with them during my trips back to the dc area and always had to  have one when i was there    things i enjoy about 5 guys  the simple menu choices  the topping choices  the free peanuts while you wait for your food and the meat is fresh   you get a very tasty and high quality burger with the toppings you like    you also get a ton of fries  even on the small order  a small fry should feed a two people no problem  if you order a cheeseburger  fries and a soda  you are looking at about  11   this location is always packed  ive been here 3 times since the placed opened at various times and days of the week and there is always a ton of people here  even with the location  crowded  your food is ready in about 10 minutes   i just wish the price was a bit cheaper  but worth a treat every so often 
i come here periodically for coffee as it across the street from my doggy daycare  the coffee is good   they used to have amazing scones but unfortunately they had to switch bakeries within the past year   pros   only place in fitchburg i can find a lemon scone  dont expect lazy jane quality    they sell day old bakery if you cant quite rationalize spending full price   they have simple syrup out for you to add to your iced drinks   nothing i hate more than adding a sugar packet to iced coffee    dollars towards free drinks add up fast on their loyalty card  cons   in contrast to other reviews  i have had really flaky service on numerous occasions    do i always come the day a new hire starts  or are they roasting something other than beans in the back  hmmm   
the products are really good  but thats if you ever get them  ive ordered 10 times there  and had to call support 10 times for missing items  incorrect charges  wrong items  had to order the same items 3 times and still couldnt get the proper item shipped   also they kind of get you since they dont offer refunds  only store credit  so each time i was forced to buy more from them  and still get the wrong orders again and again   each time the issue was the same  were a small company     which isnt justify  im very close to calling consumer protection and report them  unless i can finally get my money back from them   if you like their products  hope for the best and maybe youll receive what youve ordered  but its a gamble 
there is absolutely no way to get in contact with this location  their phone will only say the connection cannot be completed  the staff is highly incompetent and unmotivated to help with anything  place a pick up order and upon arriving they asked what we would like  we have them our name for pick and said theyd ring us up when the order was ready  we waited 30 mins for an estimated 15 and went back to the counter  she asked again what we would like and mentioned yet again  to the same person  that we had a pick up order that we waited at the location for for 30 mins  no discount and still had to pay  not to mention no a  c  thanks for wasting my time 
exactly like the frozen  eating them at 5am in vegas didnt even improve the taste  have know idea what harold or kumar were all hyped about  shitz wack    
ive actually been here a few times and am finally getting around to reviewing this restaurant  this last visit  i got a greek salad with gyro meat and a side of tzadziki  i also tried my dining partners hummus  everything was perfect  the server was friendly and delightful  i cant wait to come back 
this mall has a lot of stores and restaurants to choose from  we went there to take my grandson to the splash pad  apparently  a lot of families did that  it is such a nice setting for shopping  walking  relaxing  and playing 
i love renting from national  it is  by far  the best car rental company  they have excellent customer service and they must train their employees very well because no matter where i go in the country  nationals employees are top notch  they have an excellent array of vehicles  so you have many choices  they also have very reasonable prices 
i have eaten here probably four or five times in the last few years  i decided to finally write a review   tonights dinner was excellent  our server approached us right away  bringing us starving  hey  wed skipped lunch   guests bread and asking what we wanted for drinks  we ordered our drinks and appetizer right away   you know  because we were hungry  wine was brought promptly to the table  as were our appetizer and entrees  our server told us our entrees would be done quickly and asked if we preferred to wait or if we wanted them quickly  we really appreciated that he would ask how we preferred our food to come out  of course  we were starving  we wanted it all  we wanted it now     everything was absolutely delicious  except for one exception  and  this is just a taste preference  i dont care for the coleslaw  other than that  everything was great   we both got the burnt ends  yum  yum  yum    service was absolutely excellent 
not too bad of a wait  got some great drinks that were made exactly as ordered  the staff here are really nice and friendly  the cashier asked me if he could check if i had a free drink on my card  no one ever offers that to me  these people are great  what a treat 
i really like this casino  it appears to be very clean  all the employees i interacted with were wonderful  if you join the players club  you get a free gift and lots of extras  its easy to earn points for more extras  too  lots of dining options  really  really like this casino  nothing super upscale  but clean and nice and no overwhelming cigarette smell 
hot  fresh  and ready  what more could you ask for for a dinner of pizza  wings  and crazy bread  not a 5 star restaurant  but if its pizza you want  pizza you get  no need to call in  just go in and grab it  still love little caesars after all these year 
lots of drinks to choose from   coffee  wine  beer  tea  etc  also  they have food  i love to come here to meet with friends  it has a warm and inviting environment  plus  wine   friendly employees  love this place 
great food  great service  great music  place i go to at arrowhead mall  crispy fries  bottomless for  2 
i love how they load the groceries for you at the curbside grocery loading station  tips are not required  but i give anyhow   this is a well lit store that feels a bit more upscale than the usual grocery shop  being here does not feel like a chore 
harvest kitchen is a new american restaurant boasting creative cuisine such as what one would find in downtown  except  it is at the heart of solon  voted one of americas top 10 suburbs  with this restaurant alone  i think solon now is in the top 5   i do not get the mixed reviews  perhaps the price point  you can make this at home  dont kid yourself  lets just start with grass fed beef    with a more intense beefy taste and iron y tone to it  i had the walleye on a bed of lobster ravioli  which was not only inventive  but tasty  one of us had tender beef rib that one could part with a fork  then melt in your mouth   i loved the environment and modern loft feel to the place  the ambience was busy and energetic  on several trips here  we were seated quick and service was excellent 
ive taken several items here to be repaired or altered   they dont just do alterations   they fixed my backpack  replaced a zipper on a jacket  and fixed a cable strap for my rv awning   very pleasant and courteous staff   fair prices   fast service 
literally every time i go here i just see how incompetent the workers can be  i ask for no cheese on a burger   and every single time i check  theres fuckin cheese on there  like every single time  i have a dairy allergy and its so hard to not fuck this up but every single time  the ticket on the burger says  no cheese  and that hoe is covered in your melted plastic bullshit  how
i love bronzed    the owner is just amazing and really takes care of his clients   hes such a genuinely nice person  i will keep coming back not only for the outstanding customer service but also because i love the products they use  
this review is long over due but so far i been here twice  i have to say their hot dogs are amazing      i cant seem to find anything like this around here  i really hope your business grows  you have great staff  i am always telling people about your horchata ice cream   i have never had anything like it before  but overall you guys are worth more then 5 stars 
the pros   the store is spacious and clean   it has tons of trek bikes in a variety of of styles and prices   they do mechanical work on site  and quickly   i have never seen them too busy   the cons   i stopped by planning to purchase a bike  and it took a long time for one of the three young boys to stop by and offer to help  despite my conspicuous perusal of the bikes on display   i came to the trek store to try one of the trek womens cruisers  only to find out that they dont carry them in stock     its the trek store      how can they not have even one to show   trying to get information out of the teenage boy was an exercise in frustration   he didnt volunteer any information that i didnt directly ask for  didnt ask me about what i needed  or offer to show me bikes that were similar to the one i was looking for   when i asked for basic information about the bikes  he answered like he thought i was an idiot   getting the info i needed was like trying to brush my cats teeth  impossible     conclusion  in the end  i really needed  wanted a bike  and i left with one   my bike is awesome  but the trek store and its employees really arent   in the future when i have questions  need mechanical work done  or want to buy accessories  i plan to visit another bike shop   if you know exactly what you want  and dont require any help  then this place is probably fine   if you dont already know everything you need to  i would suggest you look elsewhere 
our family has  rediscovered  dennys and now patronize them everywhere we go  this location is no exception  their quality of meats  hand pressed burgers  and friendly staff make it a joy to eat at this age old establishment  our server  krystal  was extremely professional  kind  and helpful  she even noticed we were drinking a lot of our pop so she brought us over a carafe in case we ran low and she wasnt close by   she seemed to like the food herself and when we ordered she told us honestly  we made great choices   it is nice to go to a restaurant as old as dennys and find the food and staff get better with age  thank you dennys 
i live about a block and a half away  this location used to be a sad sports bar and lasted about a year  pho gia dinh has been a great addition to the neighborhood with the best pho ive ever had  ive tried all of the trendy places  ramen  pho    this place has the most tender tasty meat with a broth you want to dive into and stay awhile  they offer bean sprouts  jalapenos and greens along with their house made garlic chili oil  ive heard all of their vietnamese food is good but cannot seem to get away from the pho filet or chicken pho  i do love the vietnamese egg rolls too  my neighbor friend and i end up there for lunch about once a week now and crave it more often  go there and get friendly  clean service with the most delicious food  they are not open on wednesdays 
this place was excellent  i ordered islamic noodles  which is a  secret item  where they combine two other dishes  my waitress actually didnt know what it was since she was new  but luckily her colleague was able to help out  i was surprised by the interior of the place  as it was sort of casual sitting but there are wait staff  my waitress was really nice and helped me out with some touristy questions  all in all it was a great experience 
my fiance and i just moved to vegas and this place was awesome for a quick lunch  the broccoli cheddar soup was amazing and we both got frozen lemonades which we to die for  i highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a quick sit down lunch or for a quick pick up 
finally  a great bar in the far west valley and to top it all off its an irish bar     ive been there 3 times now  and the service and food have always been excellent   the potato leek soup is as good as my mothers and thats saying alot   the declans irish stew was so good it bordered on decadent   imagine a rich stew loaded with celery  carrots  leeks  and potatoes surrounding an entire lamb chop that is so tender it falls off the bone as soon as your fork touches it   my hubby loves the seafood chowder and the corned beef   the wait staff is very friendly and amazingly remembered us and our drink order after just one visit   i
so read about this place on yelp but i was a little concerned about the area  75th and mcdowell isnt the best neighborhood but i am so glad i went to the old westridge area know known as desert sky since it sounds less gang ish   anyway the food was great  they do both take out and sit down and we decided to stay  the place was very clean  food was fast and excellent  the tom yam gai soup was amazing  my and the hubby like it spicy and this sop delivered  we were very glad we didnt ask for extra spice  the soup had enough kick  the only strange thing about the soup is that it had tomatoes in it  ive had tom yam gai soup many times at many places but never with tomatoes but it was still excellent    we split the spicy basil chicken and again it was very yummy  there was a great balance of flavors as well as plenty of meat in the dish    the portions were plentiful we split the soup and an entree and we took soup and the entree leftovers home    definitely worth going to   id give it 5 stars but the area is well    75th and mcdowell but i will go back  besides if it gets to well known i wont have my new secret thai restaurant anymore   
the best ramen place here in vegas almost as close to ezogiku back home in hawaii nei 
what a inspirational soulful singer   i listened to terry at the sm pier yesterday  6 22 13  i was mesmerized   such soothing on point vocals   i was with my 90 year old mom and she enjoyed the music  but was getting fidgety  alas had to leave but first bought imagine love cd   i could have stayed all day    wishing you a beautiful world terry 
my husband gave me a mani pedi  paraffin dip and 60 minute massage at simply swank for christmas  i finally got to use it recently  the front desk greeting was a little indifferent  after that  everyone working at the salon was extremely nice  my nail technician  candice  was very friendly  the pedicure was great    very thorough  but not rough or painful    i never get manicures because my nails are very soft and the polish always chips off in 12 hours  well  i am completely amazed because the manicure i got from candice is still going strong with no chipping 4 days later  this is a miracle  i have no idea how she did it  but im ecstatic about it    the massage was a nice overall relaxing experience  the massage room is nice and the table is heated  the therapist didnt really work my chronic knots and problem spots in the way i am used to when i get a massage  so i probably personally wouldnt return here for that service  but for general relaxation it was good   the employees offered me tea  water  magazines  etc   often and really made an effort to make my visit nice  the one suggestion i would make is that at the really high end spas that ive been to  the front desk almost seems to know who you are when you walk in the door and they act like they are really happy to see you  they must just take the time to review the day or the next few hours of appointments  im even saying the current front desk approach is a problem or i am complaining about it    its more of an observation   i was all prepared to leave tips at the front desk upon leaving when i was informed that they are a no tip salon  i felt a combination of guilty and happy about this  the happy is winning out  though  and i am definitely planning on trying simply swank out for haircuts and other services 
so fun n whats even more convenient is that its 5 minutes away from home  i found this place with an awesome deal for 4 kids just in time for the weekend when i had little cousins visit  my daughter enjoyed the trampoline basketball hoop  she felt like a bball star  and despite not making it to the top  my 7 yr old definitely enjoyed the rock climbing they had  id recommend this place for anybody with children  its fun  open  family friendly  itll for sure have the kids knock out w a great nights sleep after a couple hrs of this place 
food was good   service was extremely slow   make sure you are not seated on the main floor during winter   every time someone comes in  the place is freezing   i had to wear my jacket during dinner 
great pizza and great salad  we had the shredded kale and quinoa salad  very delicious  had the gladiator pizza and the rocket man with pepperoni  our waitress was lots of help  finished off with a brownie and vanilla gelato  overall great experience 
elisa is so knowledgeable and loves dogs  my little jack russell terror was transformed in no time  she offers lots of solutions for all your less than desirable doggie behaviors  i wouldnt take my fur babies any place else 
taleda has an amazing touch and intuition when it comes to finding problem areas  not only was she committed to helping unlock my shoulder knots but she also made sure to work on areas i did not know were tight  i only wish she was in the bay area    i had a great experience and will be surely visit her again when in vegas  she was well worth the price and makes every effort to make sure that your comfort is first and foremost    i love the fact that she has a complimentary snack basket and bottled water for post session munchies  she had it stocked with cliff bars and other premium healthy snacks  taleda is first class  see her  you wont regret it 
this is the worst gas station  i would never go into this store in the evening  the man that works there is psycho  rude rude rude     has a thing against women if you reject him  id let everyone i know never go there  not worth your buisness 
i came for my birthday the pizza was delicious  but that is to be expected of metro  however  once me and my friends were seated we were practically ignored for 10 mins before our server even looked at us  it was such a shame because he was a very attached man  i could tell it was towards the end of his shift because he was very tired looking    we ordered cheese pizza  garlic knots  and my friend ordered a personal meat pizza of some sort  and all of it was very delicious 
came to this place looking for a light lunch   i had the grilled chicken salad   huge portion of salad   two people could actually share it   you get to pick two veggies to top the greens mix   i chose broccoli and red bell pepper   tons of chicken and very fresh veggies made the salad fabulous   the boys got the steak panini   they said the meat was good   too much bread in my opinion  but they said it was super yummy 
played there on mon  8  04  2 players for  80  so the good news it was cheap  course though is not in good shape  thin fairways  some of the tee boxes were simply awful  nothing but weeds and they look like cow pasture  the homes lining the courser are old and in bad shape  nice staff   good service  its sad that a course with such history is not kept better  i really wanted to like it  if you are on a budget  play it  its like 7 min  from the strip and you have some good views  maybe in better shape during fall or winter  good rental clubs  taylor made  but expensive for  59  incl  6 balls   pace was good too  finished in 3 1  2 hours 
i was so excited to have a memorable dining experience with amazing food  great service  and an incredible view  but prime only managed to come through with the view     i ordered the bone in ribeye   75 for an overcooked  forgettable steak   i ordered it rare and it came out between medium rare and medium  not an issue one should have in a restaurant of this caliber   it did come out with three sauces  two of which i enjoyed  but honestly  with a  75 steak  i dont feel like i should have to dip it in sauce to get some flavor  the steak was pretty bland   i ordered the carrot cake for dessert  it was absolutely beautifully presented  but i was disappointed that it tasted a lot more like a pineapple cake than a carrot cake  i understand trying to put your own spin on things  but i feel like it lost the essence of what a carrot cake was   the service was definitely subpar  it took them about 20 minutes after we were seated to even take our order and our drink glasses were regularly empty  nobody really checked on us to see how our food was  either   the restaurant is beautiful in the view of the fountains is gorgeous if you happen to be in one of the spots that has a few of them  which we were  but just watch the fountains outside and youll probably have just as good of a time  super disappointed in this dining experience 
as a big fan of la carnita was excited to check it out  dont get me wrong   it was tasty and all pretty much deep fried    and really anything deep fried is good but doesnt mean its great    between the four of us had most of the menu  a few highlights but most was a solid 3  5      cauliflower  best dish of the night by far   we ordered a second one    fries  as you would expect  solid fries    bucket of bones  some very good size ribs  tasty sauce    tater tots  meh   caesar wedge  meh   bologna sandwich  interesting  definitely not the bologna i remember    fried chicken handshake sandwich  good but your typical fried chicken  not the best not the worst   cocktail list was ok but not as interesting as i would have hoped  beer list was pretty good considering the american theme  but would be great to see them bring in some more american craft brews  in fact la carnita has a great interesting beer list    almost should be reversed    vibe was good   very very loud  even for us  but booth seating is great for a large group    check it out   but if youll pick a place to go back between this and la carnita   it will be the latter 
everything is awesome   i come here way too often  sandwiches  tacos  boxes  chips  salsa  you cant go wrong with anything  super friendly guys  take out or small dine in area only   go now  youll soon be addicted 
ive been coming to this place for years  i dont see why it has been getting bad reviews  i dont come to a nail salon to talk  i go there to get my nails done and the ladies in there do a wonderful job  i usually get a pedicure and occasionally a manicure so i cant speak on the artificial nails situation but they work wonders on my feet  they even do some cute nail art  we brought my niece here last year for her first salon experience and they gave her  frozen  nails  blue nail polish and little snowflakes but it was impressive they could do that on tiny fingernails  come here if you need to relax and dont need the usual hype of a salon 
they could definitely improve their internet speed     its sooo slow but other than that great place 
i have only been to sinners burger twice  but there is zero consistency   the first time  the burger was juicy  great  almost the same as burger priest  very saucy  and really great tasting over all  the second time was almost a complete opposite  the cheeseburger was heavily peppered and the patty was super dry  i made up my mind of not coming back to this place  especially that it is quite a bit of a drive from where i live 
servings are huge  my bf got the pulled pork burrito bowl aka naked burrito for  8 79  the serving is huge  the taste is good  vegetables are fresh and crunchy  however  i noticed the pulled pork is a little bit salty   i got the deep fried mars bar for  2 99  first of course i was shocked at how much larger it is compared to the deep fried mars bar at fat bastard burrito  there was too much batter than chocolate which made me feel like it lacked taste and quality  nothing too remarkable on the deep fried mars bar   you dont have to pay extra for guacamole   this place is very much similar to fat bastard burrito  if you are familiar with that place too   nothing too special  but if you are a fan of huge portions  then this is the place to be 
came here for our anniversary dinner on a tuesday night and was surprised as the place was busy  i recognized bonnie from yelp too as she greeted us and took us to our table     tip  make sure to make a reservation for dinner   first impression  amazing service  very cozy   so we ordered the garlic cheese bread as appetizer and got it in like 5 minutes  wow that was fast  the garlic cheese bread could use more cheese  really  but over all not bad   so we placed our mains order and was again surprised as the food came in like 5 minutes  definitely not what i expected  so that was great  as i was really hungry at the time   i got the buttermilk fried chicken with bread and corn and was impressed by the serving size  but not too impressed by the taste  i find the corn to be really spicy  and definitely not what i expected  but over all not bad  i regret not getting the la mac and cheese but i will definitely get that next time i come here   my bf got chicken and ribs and he was also surprised at the serving size he cant even finish the meal  but he enjoyed it still and found the food really tasty   over all i would go back for sure to try other dishes  and i am coming back because i was pleased with the service as well 
their cakes and meal combos have an uncanny resemblance with lucullus bakery goods   tried this place out today  as i noticed that even though they have very few reviews  the reviews are of a higher than average rating  so that piqued my interest   it is a small nice and clean bakery with few seating  when i came in on a saturday afternoon around 3pm  i noticed they didnt have much baked goods left so i thought i would order me a meal combo   before i even mentioned what i wanted  the lady immediately said they only have one type of food left from their all day lunch menu  which is the curry chicken   5   so we got that  and also i got myself a luncheon meat sandwich from their all day breakfast menu   3 50    i wasnt even done paying and the curry chicken meal was already prepared and delivered at the table   right off the bat  it so reminded me of lucullus bakery  and how their pre packaged boxed meals get sold out pretty quickly  when the curry chicken came  it just confirmed my suspicion that they probably have the same supplier as lucullus bakery  as the size of the boxed meal is identical to lucullus bakerys   the luncheon meat with egg sandwich is average  nothing too special  i guess i could say that about this place in general  its just an average bakery   after lunch  i ordered one slice of cheesecake for  2 80 and again  it looks exactly the same as luculluss cheesecake from my previous photos i took when i went to their location by the new cineplex theatre in markham   the cheesecake was soft and rich  and really filling  the cake is not light and fluffy  it is not that sweet  but it is really rich and a bit more dense than a japanese cheesecake  its just okay   the good thing about this place is the cheap price  but i probably wont go back as there are better choices in the area that prepare fresher food on site for the same price    review 42 of 100
i havent been to donburi in a year and i miss going here  so i thought id try them out again  i came here on a sunday evening and place is a little busy  but we were still able to find a booth   i want to try their smaller snacks and my bf wanted to get a donburi gyuu don  i find the prices quite high for such a small portion   and i was reminded of the reason why i have stopped going here for a year  the long wait  we came hungry and we had to wait 25 30 minutes for our food   so overall  long wait for food  high price for the serving size  but what could be worth going to is the taste  their food is tasty i have to give them that  but then again i could say the same for grand noodle  which is much cheaper   so whatever 
wow  i just came from the south and the biscuits and gravy here is better than what i had down there   the gravy was fab boo  so rich and flavorful vs white paste  and the bloody marys are nicely spiced   heavy on the meat here  just note 
i really enjoy coffee shops like grouchy johns  there is a special connection that the owners of spots like these have with coffee and it shows  grouchy johns is definitely a spot that i would probably be at all the time to study and have a great coffee if i were in still in college  i guess that really shouldnt stop me because i guess one could say i could write up reviews and still have a great coffee  alas  i digress     as i mentioned  it is a great spot to study or do some computer related activity because they have wifi  coffee  access to outlets  and snacks   they have almond milk which is a bonus because i drink way too much soy milk from other coffee spots that dont offer it    i get the iced almond milk latte with an extra shot of espresso  delicious  unfortunately i tend to kill it before i even make it to my desk at work   then this john gets grouchy also 
with over 1700  reviews what can i say that hasnt already been said   the burgers are good and the service is sometimes hit or miss at times   they do tend to get crazy busy on the weekends and peak hours but the quality of the food remains consistent  even on the busy nights     personally  i like to build my own burger and add bacon and the point reyes blue cheese   i get that this is a fusion burger spot and i might be missing the whole idea  but i have had nearly all of their burgers and i really liked the black   green burger minus the spinach   which seems to just all fall out anyway   it seems to make more sense to people that i build a burger rather than say a  black   green burger   no spinach  because that seemed to confuse people     other things i would recommend at bachi burger    salt and pepper garlic fries   oxtail chili cheese fries   and both pork and duck steamed bao sandwiches   try to time your meal here outside of the normal peak periods and you should be able to enjoy a good meal without a wait 
i was really impressed with our server   he was serving the entire dining area and never once wrote down an order  everything with spot on  the sea dragon roll was phenomenal and the veggie fried rice was superb    its a bit on the expensive side  but its las vegas so its to be expected 
thought i had the right coupon and they took it anyways   very quick and professional  will be back there next year 
my friends and i stopped by for a late lunch   we only had a few hours before dinner so we werent super hungry   i ordered the baked brie  served with roasted garlic and toasted bread   one of my friends ordered the arugula salad with walnuts  grapefruit and goat cheese  and my other friend ordered the smoked salmon  served with bread  capers and creme fraiche    we ordered a small carafe of a st  germaine cocktail  it was  12 50 for the carafe and we got about 5 short drinks out of it    before our food came out they brought us warm bread with delicious butter  and this grated carrot salad marinated in honey along with other things   it was delicious  our food came out shortly after and we loved all three of our dishes   i forget our servers name but he was super nice and prompt   i would love to go back to try their entrees   our dishes were a little bit pricey but definitely not too bad for being on the strip 
i cannot get enough of this place   its got a pretty diverse menu so everyone will be able to find something they like  if they like chicken that is      i love that it is no nonsense   you order your food  they call your name  you pick it up   the end   the people who take your order have it down to a science   they are fast yet friendly   the only exception to the rule is the really tall guy with long hair   he is the rudest person ive ever met  but he seems to be part of the establishment  although i havent seen him in a while      the food  i love their corn bread   it is amazing   its sweet and moist and flavorful     i usually get the chicken and rice con queso   then i add the tico sauce thats on the table   i dont know what this stuff is  but its so good   its not hot  but it does have a lot of spice and vinegar     my favorite sides are the squash casserole and the pineapple casserole  but this is only served occasionally    the daily sides are listed up on a board above the counter     also if you go on wednesday  its chicken pot pie day   they have an excellent chicken pot pie   its huge and could feed at least 2 people  if youre willing to share      overall   if you love chicken  youll love this place   they have a great selection   they even have wings which ive heard were great 
definitely not impressed  look for a scathing review following this one from my girlfriend that is the main lease holder   we have a backyard that is dirt  a stockade fence that is chipped and falling down  we have termite damage  we have water damage  that hasnt been fixed   only spackle patched we have a sewage smell emanating from the mudroom that fills the entire house  though intermittently  that has been  fixed  three times  we pay through the nose for a house where the neighborhood comps are 30  less  we have an addition where the walls crumble when you put a nail or screw in them we have a leaky toilet that is costing us alot more money on our water bill each month  we have neighbors that are hoarders and have been infested with ticks and rats  we have the neighbors dogs breaking through the fence and attacking our dogs  we have flys  presumably from the hoarders everywhere in the back yard  we have a dirt backyard as i mentioned that is uneven and full of divets and concrete patches that are dangerous to people and our dogs   though response to some of the bigger problems have been fairly prompt  they seem most comfortable blaming us as new tenants and simply putting a band aid on things    would recommend against 
awesome    hole in the wall  dont expect a five star place  its not that   the food and the prices are great   7 street tacos and a couple of beers for what  twelve bucks   and soooooooooo delicious    my girlfriend and i go frequently  birria de chivo  goat  tacos con todos  carne asada  horchata  everything ive had is delicious   no complaints 
terrible experience never going back treated me badly because im 20 after scratching my teeth he threw the tools and walked away
would not accommodate in switching tables  my mom told the employee that she wanted a larger table and the worker told her no because it was their busy time and if a larger party comes  we would have to move  there were 2 empty tables and it was past 2pm  are you kidding me  go find another restaurant that would ease your dining experience  theres so many different sushi restaurants around the area that you can go to 
justin has helped me more than once and he has been very prompt with getting back to me with all the information i need  he made sure my case was taken care of to the best extent and was very knowledgeable about the law and other regulations  definitely would recommend 
pizza huts food takes like crap 
whats up with the bogus  resort fee     18 a day for internet and a newspaper i dont want  plus the drink coupon   sorry  id rather go buy a drink at a different bar of my choice and not the smoke infused one by the elevator   i think that it is completely bogus to charge an addition fee on a hotel room that i booked through one the hotels com  expedia  orbits websites   i have never been charge an additional fee at any other hotel when i have booked online   the hotel room was nice but when i complained about the smell of weed on my floor coming from one room the waitstaff just shrugged their shoulders 
i wanted a new nissan altima  so i went to nissan online and sent  requests to all of the local nissan dealers   auto nations tempe came back with the best deal   i received an out the door price from the salesman   john g  next morning i called him to verify it was an out the door price   he said it was   i said i would send my wife down with a check to pick up the car   when she got there they wanted an additional  500 00   she called me and i talked to the guy    he said he had given me a finance price and cash price was  500 00 more   i said  that was wrong and i had verified the price for my wife to bring the check  he said if i would finance it  they would honor the price   i said can i pay it off when the payment book comes with no interest or fines   they said yes i could   saturday i received my 1st payment book and my wife called to get the payoff   it had  115 00 interest on it   tempe nissan seem to tell you anything you want to hear to get the sale  i will never do business with them again and do not recommend them 
this is a review on misael apponte as a professional hair artist in hair color work  i know misael in the context of an industry peer and out of the many true artists in the united states  he is in the top 5   misaels color work is beautiful  i met him back in early 2000 something in new york and in la  i run into him at color courses all over the states  i have watched him create haircolor looks for many models and regular folk  i know a few people who have had color services by him  i go out of my way to attend as many of his classes as possible    put aside his skill  and peel down to the layer of humanity  i can still recommend misael to you as a good human to trust with your image needs    if you want great haircolor with that extra touch you cant find at other places   then i suggest you pick up the phone and give visual impact a call and book an appointment    misael is very good 
we sat at the back bar which im glad we did  its quieter and you have more room  i highly recommend going with the chefs tasting  you get to sample a lot of the menu and try food you normally wouldnt  you will definitely not leave hungry  all the food we had tasted great   service was even better  we will come back for sure 
yes we do have a takeout  delivery place that isnt pizza     we have eaten here a couple times and it is true that the decor is a bit old   however  the thing i love the most is ordering takeout   when i am tired and i want a meal and i dont want fast food this is our go to place   we usually order the pot stickers  egg rolls  and lemon chicken with fried rice and beef chow mein   the potions are huge and the first time i was shocked at the quality and size of the meats    my husband and i could split one of the meals if we wanted   much of the food is fried but done the right way   sure i will admit  it is no p f  changs but then p f doesnt deliver 
good size theaters  huge selection of mainstream movies with a decent number of indie ones  service is always courteous and they do a good job of keeping it clean 
i love this costco  i come at least twice a week today though  was not a good experience  i had a lot of little things i bought and needed a box  i asked for one  but there lady putting the stuff in my cart looked at me and said  were out sweetie   as im staring at a cart full one lane over to her  so i walked over and grabbed box  so she could put the stuff in it  it was raining outside and did not feel like putting stuff in the box on my own with the rain  so  i start talking to the cashier  pay and turn around to see the damn box set on top of my cart     empty  im in awe  why are people at work not working 
my husband had been begging me to go to this place to check out with him for months  so  after seeing pictures and reading a few reviews  i decided to go  mind you  this was the first time for the both of us  and i was pretty excited to try something different in vegas  as we walked in  it was quite smaller than what i had imagined    which  i loved    i felt like it was more intimate  after ordering  they brought out teas  which were out of this world  then came the food  tea sandwiches were good  and the different flavors definitely played with your taste buds in such a way  i cant even begin to explain  so    we moved on to the next plate  egh didnt care for the scones  a bit under cooked  jellies were good  though  finally  the desserts  i was so incredibly excited   as they all looked delicious  unfortunately  out of the 5  one was just  okay   everything else was too bitter and has a funny taste as it touched your tongue  here comes the bad part  as my husband and i were sitting there  all of a sudden i get a sudden urge to vomit  as does he  i barely make it to the bathroom  for 5 minutes im throwing every thing up  i come out  and then its my husbands turn  cold sweat  bitter stomach  bad food   such a let down for such a beautiful place   for the price  95  which tip is automatically included  totally not worth it 
i came across this place by accident and now i go so much that the girls know my name when i start placing my order   the food is always tasty and fresh  fyi  go right before noon    it gets jam packed in there 
the meat here is very good  the only down fall is the salad bar  they have very few items and no soups    staff is nice  but you can get more for your money elsewhere 
great little family run resturant in a somewhat obscure strip mall   really good lebanese offerings including kibbe  stuffed grape leaves  kafta pita sandwiches  and kabobs  nothing fancy  just solid quality middle eastern cuisine 
wow  what a surprise   this place  sporting 4 star italian food  is tucked into a run down strip mall  you walk into the door expecting a middle of the road mom n pop experience and what do you get  first class decor  service  and food  all three of us had a phenomenal meal with outstanding service  cant wait to go back 
fantastic gym  and even better group of people   everyone is serious about working out  and relax we d about everything else   if you are looking to do cross fit  or for a treadmill and eliptical  keep looking  if you actually want to get stronger and do it the right way  and have fun doing it  you wont do better than revolution 
excellent food   i got the tandoori chicken with the medium spiciness which was perfect   the chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really  really mouthwatering good   i also got the basmati rice  which was perfect as well  the cheese naan was worth it as well  very soft and fresh with great flavor   i love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well   i will come back the next time im in vegas for business  i ate a bunch of high end high rated food in the resorts while i was here and this is what stood out the most   im partial to this kind of stuff  though  but ultimately id love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food i had here this evening 
i love nola  weve been here twice  the selection are always pleasing to our large crew  a nice selection of cocktails and daily specials  my only complaint is to have the live music go on a little later   i love the live jazz music but a 7 pm reservation becomes  a yelling match for conversation  will definitely return    note to self ask for medium spice on the jambalaya 
was advertised as rooms and bathrooms remodeled  the room basically was with flooring and end tables but all else was old  the bathrooms omg were not remodeled  were moldy old and nasty  see pictures  the front desk girl awesome  cleaning staff very sketchy    i did not want my room cleaned by them  i asked them in hall for fresh towels  they could not speak english  made me put dirty towels in hall floor but did not give me towels off cart  i asked again 30 minutes later and she got mad  walked to front desk as i stood in hallway  she finally brought towels and would not look me in eye  i think they wanted in our room  just saying  sketchy cleaning husband wife team  i personally do not recommend this hotel  i only give one star for the sweet front desk clerk otherwise it would be zero stars 
i just enjoyed a fantastic ayce lunch here with a friend    the food was amazing  i recommend the vampire roll   the only thing better than the food was the service  the manager was our chef and she knocked it out of the park    thank you for a great experience 
i am yet again a failure at planning anything so when my boyfriend asked me where i wanted to go for brunch when we landed early in phoenix  it was up to him to save the afternoon  he quickly found this place and it looked 10x better than anything i had book marked so we took our rental car here asap    its kind of hard to find because its located in the back of the farm  there is no restaurant sign which is what we were looking for at first  there are a bunch of other restaurants on the premises but this was the only one that was busy the entire time   20 minute wait on a saturday afternoon  i think they messed up and let the guy after us get seated before but whatever  i grabbed myself an iced tea from the self serve section while we waited and shared it with my boyfriend teehee  the wait didnt seem long at all because we got to walk around the beautiful farm    i got the farm omelette and he got the pork is the new black omelette because i refused to let him get the same thing as me  our order took forever to come out  people that were seated at the same time  after us were pretty much done with their orders by the time ours came out  i think they mustve forgotten our order or something wtf  bastards  our waiter dexter kept reassuring us our order was on our way though     the biscuit was bomb  i am so happy our waiter offered us some jam because i pretty much loaded my entire biscuit with enough jam for the both of us  so noms  totally worth the 500 buttery calories it probably was  i shouldve subbed the goat cheese in my omelette but i wasnt thinking  it came with cauliflower and carrots and all sorts of veggies ive never seen in an omelette before    all in all a perfect way to start off our little weekend getaway in arizona 
snooze is top of the food chain for breakfast  one of the best breakfast places in the country without a doubt  everyone who works here seems incredibly happy  wait times get long  so plan out when you intend to come  aka dont come on a saturday morning and expect seating right away  pancake flights are out of this world  
ive been eating at carlos obriens off and on for over a decade now   in that time their menu hasnt changed much  and ultimately thats a good thing   its a restaurant that  is realistic about what they are   you wont find a lot of authenticity here  but you will find consistently decent american style mexican food   and thats just fine   id normally rate them four stars  but theyve had a bad run the last year or so   still decent  but not up to their normal standards   their best dish is probably the pollo fundido which is rich and delicious   im also a fan of their papa fajita which is a reasonably healthy option if you order it without the cheese   their chips and salsa are always good and the service is consistent  friendly and always good   a low point is their soda mixes which are hit and miss   overall a decent place to grab a decent meal  but a place that could be a lot better with a little more effort 
ive eaten at both vitos mesa location and at this one and id say the product between the two is comparable   the pizza here is on the pricey side and never feels like a great value   its decent food and better than edible  but its not really something i end up going out of my way to order   the texture of the crust never fees quite right to me  almost too spongy  and overall pizzas lack flavor   perhaps the other offerings on the menu are better  but to this point ive just had the pizza which is passable but not great 
bill takes the angst out of getting my hair cut 
wass in las vegas looking for a brazilian restaurant   i must say the food was amazingly delicious and the customer service was great not only from our waters steven and jose but everyone over all was very attentive  if your looking for great food and good service this is the place to go 
the food here is amazing   every time i go i am more and more impressed   the last time was what made me write this review and give them a 5 star high five   the meal  spicy beet soup arctic char on a bed of beets  pears  salad w   almonds sticky toffee banana pudding moroccan mint tea  everything was just delicious   in fact  i was there the weekend before and should have gotten the arctic char   i am so glad i came back to get it     things you should know  i totally hate beets   and this whole meal was filled with beets   gallery grill made me like something i hate   thats a whole star in itself     the arctic char was so tender and flaked right off the skin   you didnt even need to use a knife  it was fork worthy   i also enjoyed the beets  pears and almonds it was placed upon   all very fresh   usually after 2 courses im stuff but the portion sizes are perfect and we had dessert   i kind of wish i had selected a different dessert item  but do not get me wrong the sticky toffee banana pudding was great   i was a little thrown off because it wasnt so sweet that my fillings wanted to fall out   basically  it was done well but im used to bad  sickeningly sweet sticky toffee pudding   i left without feeling like throwing up even though i had a 3 course lunch   another star   i also appreciate their tea selection   they have an assortment of teas which makes dessert that much more desirable and possible  aiding in digestion    i definitely love the gallery grill   the most important thing is that everything they make tastes extremely fresh   i prefer lunch over brunch  as well 
gelato is hardly ever done correctly in north america and i have found that it usually has the consistency of ice cream  hollywood gelato does it right  i had a small  that actually came with a lot of gelato  you get two flavours   i was feeling light so i got pear and strawberry  the pear was amazing   not only in taste but in texture  it actually had the texture of pear  i found that very impressive  the strawberry was tart and delicious  i enjoyed both and i usually am not that interested in fruit based gelato   unfortunately i do not live close by but when im in the neighbourhood i will stop in  the interior design is quite interesting   meaning it is quirky so be prepared for that 
we have friends and they love ramen   today  i ate at sansotei and we really enjoyed it   the fried chicken was quite good and i really liked my ramen   i went with miso and the broth was quite lovely   i like the skinny noodles so i was happy but of course  i can always use more noodles in my broth   we had green tea cheesecake for dessert and it was a welcome surprise   quite good   overall  i am pretty novice when it comes to ramen but i enjoyed my lunch   my only complaint is that if you cant finish you cant take it home because they do not have to go containers 
sweet jesus is overrated  thats right  i went there  the concept is awesome  especially if youre a lover of soft serve  they give you an obscenely large amount of ice cream that your pancreas should not be exposed to  covered in neat toppings  it was tasty  and i struggled to finish  i had the birthday cake cone and it came with a candle  smothered in delicious vanilla cake   first off  there is no reason for that line  it is ridiculous  the lineup started before noon when they opened  why did you make such a tiny shop  it reminds me of grand electrics mini space that created lineups out the door simply because the space is small  there is also a lot of staff traffic going in and out of that area and youre going to hear a frustrated chorus of  excuse me     it is this chaos that i believe led to them screwing up our order  the woman at the front verified our order twice but told them the wrong thing  then the woman behind the counter was all frustrated about it publicly  i found that pretty unprofesh   i wont be back for these instagram worthy treats  the whole process was too annoying  see ya never  sweet jesus 
came for brunch yesterday and enjoyed   i had the eggs charlotte and my friend had beaus breakfast   both were pretty good   our waitress was attentive and did coffee refills frequently and was very quick   i enjoyed my meal and my friend enjoyed hers    i have a brunch wish that never seems to come true   brunch providers will stop making big  boring salads as a side   there has to be something else   overall  the food was good but it did not wow me for brunch   also  my tea was not piping hot so it didnt last but thats just me being picky   i dont live nearby but if i did im sure id come here often   since i do not live nearby i dont think ill go out of my way 
established in 1981 by two brothers from italy  abruzzos has been a richmond hill staple for as long as i can remember  in addition to delicious pizza and panzerottis  they also offer pastas and italian sandwiches  but i can only vouch for the pizza and panzos  the pizza is solid and the party size pizzas are great for groups or events  they boast a wide range of fresh toppings inclduing some you would not find at any ordinary pizzeria  the panzos are delish squared  for the record i have never ordered a baked one from them because the fried ones are too good to be true  i also recommend getting a side of meat or plain tomato sauce to accompany your panzos crispy edges   see below the selection of toppings available to you should you decide to order from abruzzos     anchovies  artichokes  bacon  black forest ham  black olives  broccoli  capers  capicollo  diced tomato   double cheese  italian sausage  extra cheese   feta cheese  fresh hot peppers  fresh mushrooms  grilled egg plant   goat cheese  green olives  green pepper   grilled chicken  grilled zucchini  ground beef  hot peppers  onions  pepperoni  pineapple   potatoes  plum tomato  red onions  roasted red pepper  salami   shrimps  spinach  sun dried tomato   4  5
hana bi sushi is a cozy little joint located in the first markham plaza  it is probably the smallest sushi venue i have ever been in  but i felt comfortable and was greeted kindly    a fairly large menu was presented to me and i browsed through it whilst sipping green tea  i decided to take advantage of a lunch special as it contained a wide spread which would allow me to get a good feel of the chefs skills and quality of ingredients  my bento consisted of 2 salmon sushi  2 red snapper sushi  2 pieces of anonymous maki  2 tempura rolls  a portion of bulgogi and some gyoza for  9 99    i was excited to dig in  but disappointed that everything remained fairly at par  the sushi had more rice packed underneath then usual and there was no wasabi between the fish and rice  i like the temperature of my sushi to be cool and fresh  this was at room temperature and extra chewy  as for the bulgogi  i have eaten it almost everywhere and i have had much better  the gyoza was under and unevenly cooked and my bowl of rice was dry and i believe it was placed in the bowl long before it made it to my table      i probably will not be returning to this restaurant  however this could have been just a one off experience i had  i have come across positive reviews online and some via word of mouth  i also feel the venue is homey and the service is good  unfortunately  sushi can not hold a candle to other local gems like tomo    dewa mata 
clean and professional  i have been here several times and always a great experience  amber is absolutely amazing
i came here for valentines day craft supplies and i was not disappointed   they carried an assortment of paper  stickers and glitter for all my card making needs   prior to entering  i figured it would be a costly venture but it was very reasonable   i made a personalized card for about  8 and i have spent that one generic store cards countless times   i will definitely be back again when i need more crafty supplies 
yum   they have some good ice cream  i had bordeaux cherry chocolate in a sugar cone  they were making waffle cones right by the entrance which i found to be neat  my ice cream was good and had huge chunks of cherries in it  the ice cream itself had a very light flavour that was satisfying on a hot day    the lineup was insane and eventually went down the street  my boyfriend had gelato and it was way too cold to get the proper appreciation for creaminess  overall i enjoyed my visit minus these two things  i think they need a bigger shop 
this is my fav restaurant in chinatown   i was also a fan of lucky dragon when i was in undergrad  but new ho king is where we usually grab our takeout nowadays   the new interior design is pretty spiffy and theyre very efficient   if you call in an order they need 20 minutes to have it all ready for you   i find the food particularly greasy and not in a pleasant way   in general  it is okay   if im craving cheap chinese food then ill order from here   i just do not really find any of the dishes flavourful or overly satisfying   that being said  we order here about 4 times a year and have done okay   the late night menu is another story   you cannot go wrong in that department 
the food was gross and there was a tentacle sticking out of my soup when it didnt say there would be a tentacle on the menu   afterwards  i headed over to mcdonalds because i was so unhappy i didnt touch my meal 
delicious  particularly if youre eating vegetarian  i always order the coconut rice and panang curry  i also enjoy the cold rolls  basically  just this order will feed me 3 meals  i am always happy when i order in  also  ive never eaten in the restaurant  i 100  suggest ordering in from this place  fo sho 
delicious cold pressed juice  i had pear  it was grand  i dont know why it took me so long to try it out  i sampled the turmeric lemonade but it really didnt do anything for me  i came at the end of the day so most of the juice was sold out but the pear was awesome  i will definitely stop in again  they have nut milk as well and i will try it some day   at  5 00 for a small bottle it is a bit of a hit to the wallet but just imagine how much fruit is used to produce that juice 
my favourite theatre in toronto  although tiff blb is better technically varsity is great for large scale releases   i also like that they will do smaller scale releases  foreign films etc   no obnoxious kids screaming and running around  even for movies that are more youth oriented   it is pretty central and not gigantic like amc or scotiabank  so you get fewer crowds   i also find the people who attend movies here more respectful   if it is playing here  trust me   i wont go elsewhere 
what a great sushi place   the interior is so trendy and awesome and i heard through the grapevine the owner did all the photography   the lunch specials are massive and delicious   i usually get vegetarian sushi and the vegetarian sushi is the bomb   you get crisp  fresh veggie tempura   2 types of yummy maki and miso soup with a little  green salad   and then at the end of your meal  you get cute little treats like mini smoothies or a craved orange   the service was great and i was so pleased with the entire experience  to the point where i returned less than a week later   i am so happy to have finally discovered good sushi close to the u of t campus 
let me start of by telling you that the blt sandwiches are phenomenal  the smokehouse burger was decent  the food came out very quickly as well  hats off to the chefs 
prices are a little expensive considering the food quality  lunch combo costs  8 including noodles and a hot drink  yin yang milk tea was good  the noodles are just so so  one thing that makes me uncomfortable is that waiters assume your tips before you offer  thats not polite  if youre in the mall and just want to grab some food  id suggest going for mcdonald instead 
very authentic hongkong style drinks and buns  a go to breakfast place on top of my heart  the buns there cost around 1 dollar and for 2 5 you could get a hot milk tea or coffee plus a bun of your own choice  there are some other great deals like 6 buns for 4 75 or buy 5 egg tarts get 1 for free  delicious and reasonable price  recommend 
this is one of our favorite places to order pizza  we usually get it to go  but have eaten there on occasion  the staff is always friendly  my only complaint is that they make the breadsticks differently each time we order them so sometimes they are awesome and other times they are just okay  ive learned to ask for the pamesan breadsticks as they are the best     if you have room for dessert  get the pullookie  its great 
great music  great burgers   had the rail with cheese and bacon   definitely good choice 
i love love love this place  i will be dreaming about this food for a month until i can get back into town and come back to this restaurant   i went here with some bulgarian friends of mine  they knew i always wanted to try bulgarian food and they recommended we go here you can tell when a place is going to be really epic  when you have all the locals eating there   i had my friends order since they knew what we should be getting  everything we ordered it was absolutely perfect  apparently the shaft gets all of his food is fresh every single day nothing is ever frozen ever  i cannot tell you how important that is to me  and you can definitely tell in the flavors that are presented to you here   the prices are ridiculously inexpensive for the quality and amount of food given  they have an average wine list that i was able to order from     loved that    i gave this four stars because i can see how someone that doesnt speak the language might have a problem ordering or communicating  with the waitress   this place is a bit dark  but i understand they will be expanding a new wing to it so its possible that might change very quickly   i love this place  and will go back again and again and again it is worth every single penny 
this place is great  the staff is friendly  the food is always good and the location is nice and clean  i always order something different and they always accommodate my request    i have a lot of food allergies and am not able to eat corn  they were able to accommodate my soft taco request by substituting the normal corn tortillas with flour  that was so nice  no extra charge and the food was amazing    parking is easy  menu is big  food is delicious     and i cant wait to go back   great job guys  
i have been playing at gvr for months now and only recently discovered the sushi   saki within   i was introduced this week by a friend and ended up opting not for the ayce sushi and was delighted both by the atmosphere  food and service   i enjoyed the free meal so much  i decided to go back the next night to celebrate my girlfriends birthday  this time  deciding on the ayce option   we started off with ehe appetizer ecstasy which is japanese radish and tuna in a blossom design  resting in sauce with mayo   it is an expensive app and i was surprised to see it on the ayce menu  but you have to try this   the artistry alone is awesome  but the taste is even better   over the next hour we killed a variety of rolls and sashimi  yellowtail  salmon and albacore   it was melt in your mouth    the service was great  cesar taking the lead but the others pitching in and team serving was fantastic   there is a limit of one hour for the aye menu  but with the team service  we never waited more than a few moments     the food itslelf was fantastic  fresh  no off tastes or odors   the rice was superb and the sauces were amazing   this was my first ayce and i plan on making this my sushi joint   make sure to take care of the staff  and bring all of your friends   you will not be disappointed 
generic bubble tea place  nothing special but i do come by when im in the area  they open up until midnight which is a plus  the staff are friendly  albeit a bit robotic in their voice after working for presumably long hours   the place could be cleaner though  for example  the tables arent always cleaned or have garbage on them  sticky even at times      shame that not all the customers throw their trash away  though  it is usually filled with people and quite busy when i go so it is understandable how that could be difficult to manage for the staff   they also seem to have some sort of promotion going on  i got a stamp card last time i went    apparently in support of sickkids  ill try to finish it for good cause 
by a recommendation from a resident here in chandler  my fiance took our car to be serviced  three bolts sheered off of our tire the night before he came here  bright and early the next day  they helped my fiance out immediately  they took great care to make sure wed make it safely back home which is 6 more hours away  they were extremely professional and kind to him  he was so thankful  they gave him advice and let us know about their other locations that happen to be in our area  were so glad they helped us out at a time in which we werent sure we were going to make it back home 
best korean bbq in town and it is nice to have a go to place in phoenix  the server alex had mad skillz and was dedicated to our experience  will be coming back 
love this place   the fried chicken is amazing and their buttered corn and cornbread are incredible   everyone is really friendly and polite  and the prices are really fair for how much food you get   cant wait to go back next time im in town 
what a fun place   the staff is youthful  energetic and silly    just what you need to counterbalance the solemnity of being in the bible belt for an extended period of time     the food was great  presented at the perfect pricepoint  cheap   i think i overdosed on sweet tea  enjoy 
good inexpensive cafe food  pleasant waitresses  things on menu you wont find in franchise restaurants 
excellent service   just picked up a brand new pistol  very friendly and helpful staff   will definitely be coming back again 
love their french fries  i know  this is totally random  the bento boxes are delicious and the kids absolutely love it 
i love the korean restaurant and chinese restaurant in the back  they have kalbi and boba drinks  there is also a panaderia  lots of noodles to choose from  i personally wouldnt buy meat from this place  but they carry a lot of great items  i could spend all day snaking through the aisles  i love the little kitchen section  they have cooking utensils  awesome asian cookware  etc       this place is a gem 
update  bill  the owner  stepped up and intervened   he was proactive on finding a resolution to my complaint   i will say things moved along satisfactorily thereafter  he went above and beyond to satisfy us  and now our grill areas are beyond what we expected   i thank  bill for his responsiveness  and we both gained an understanding of the challenges of small businesses and bill ensured that any miscommunications were corrected   i am more than satisified with the outcome 
i was traveling for leisure and went in to use this club since i was a diamond member   excellent staff  clean club and great locker rooms   the usual
finding  a company you trust to service your investment property is hard especially when you cant be there  after requesting a quote via email  i was scheduled shortly after followed by the bid for repair which i was told when i should receive and like clock work  i received as promised  i knew this was the one to hire  customer service is exceptional letting you know what is happening throughout the process and the price is good  after repair  bill was sent and paid shortly after followed up by another statement showing payment was received  little things like this makes it much easier during tax time  throughout the process  communication was done via email which was nice not having to disrupt your day but keeping posted what was going on and eliminating having to play phone tag   almeida is a company that takes care of your property and does a great job at a great price 
i love this place  okay  ive only been here twice  but ive also only ever been to charlotte twice    and ive gone here during both my visits  so  thats gotta mean something  right    rock climbing  rope courses  canoeing  whitewater rafting   this place has everything you could need to have a fun  adventurous day in the outdoors   the entire center is beautifully built and well maintained  i cannot wait to go again the next time i swoop on down to the queen city   ps  the food truck  i wish i remembered the name of it  is super good and well priced  quinoa   sweet potato soft tacos for the win 
very fun ride and very nice staff  view from balloon was amazing  happy to have done it here 
vegas strip    setting is nice  they advertise a real cheap breakfast and then after they sit you down they tell you we are out of bacon   sausage    wth   waitress was either rude  or a newbie  she had a heavy european  or russian very hard to understand  accent and was not attentive at all  took forever to get coffee  and when we got it it was cold   to top it off they forgot my toast and after i told her she asks   you no get it   really   food was good  but would not come back
nice chill karaoke spot  good deal not too pricey  rooms look modern and neat  bathrooms were clean and decorated very sheik and modern  love the batman for men and wonder woman for women bathroom concept  awesome sinks  machines were good  drink prices not too bad either 
this is one of the worst restaurants in cleveland   the waitress never even asked if im ready to order  or asked if she could get me anything else   very non friendly from the hostess to the servers   i try to not stereotype typical cleveland attitudes  but this is exactly the kind im talking about   the food was also very bland  my mushroom omelette was swimming in grease  and my hash browns were as tasteless as an andrew dice clay stand up routine   anyway  stay away from this place 
i love pita jungle   all of them   everytime i come to visit my parents in az and i fly into sky harbor  on our way up to payson i beg my drivers to indulge me   i have tried to re create their hummus  but i cant    it is truly amazing  so smooth and delicious   and the price is right    try a comparable  upscale  place and you would be paying triple the price   the salads are awesome   i am a big fan of the lentil fatoosh  the broiled chicken  the honey pasta  and the greek salad   the fresh and light dressings are awesome   as for the pitas  the california beach club is awesome   and their smoothies  so freakin good   and their iced tea is not your run of the mill stuff either   service has always been fine  and when it has been lacking  the food has always made up for it   i live in chicago and i wish they would open an outlet here  because we have nothing like it here   we are the city of big asses with our deep dish pizza  hot dogs  and sausages   i miss you  pita jungle 
9 30pm and someone walks out to tell people that you have to go into the drive thru  i sat there blocked in for 6 minutes before one car got to advance   they were out of one of 2 items i wanted to order 
best ramen place i have been to in a long time  i live in arizona but travel to vegas every month for work  this place is a must when in town  reminds me of the traditional ramen spots in japan and the service is awesome  i typically get the miso with an extra egg 
we had noticed this place several times driving by  and we had read all of the positive reviews  so last night we finally decided to give it a try   all we can say  is  wow    they make a nice atmosphere  and the service is very friendly and attentive  our server made some very good suggestions about what to order   the food was simply amazing   very fresh  very nice spice  and so wonderfully seasoned  very flavorful and great texture  we had the paneer tikka  idly  hakka noodles  daal tad aka  navrathan korma  and three different kinds of bread  butter naan  roti  and onion kulcha  all of it perfect   the best i have ever tried outside of india itself   we cant wait to return 
ive been going to the black angus steak house for over 20 years  in that span ive tried every high end toronto steak house and none have produced a piece of meat as good as the angus  period    heres how you do the angus  take down two extra dry gin or vodka martiinis  at least a couple baskets of their garlic cheese bread  eat a few pickles  next  step lively through a shrimp cocktail  then order your steak  filet  bone in rib  new york  theyre all awesome  go for hte 16 oz new york  blue rare  mammoth your way through that  finish it up with a couple fingers of your favourite single malt  and weave home  thats all there is to it 
this is clearly the best indian restaurant in town   having moved to madison form chicago several years ago  i bemoaned the lack of high quality indian restaurants   i found the local favorites to be highly over rated   that is  until taste of india opened   my 5  and 8 year old daughters have come to love indian food as a result of regularly eating here     the lunch buffet is small  but what is offered is excellent   my preferred meal is dinner  my favorite dish is chili chicken  nice and spicy   other excellent dishes include mango chicken  malai kofta and aloo gobhi   incidentally  swagat  also relatively new  is also excellent  but taste of india has the edge with its location on charming monroe street 
dont waste your time  it went downhill fast after terminex took over  their service techs were alright  but their office staff is just plain awful  stay away at all costs 
this is a great little place  kind if off the beaten path but well worth it  the food is great quality and very well priced  always check the daily specials  everything has been great 
have been here twice   both times were excellent   first time there i had gumbo which was some of the best ive had  this time had fried dumplings for an app and there were delicious   also had a roti with beef and cajun sauce   it was huge with great flavors   the grits were also good 
are you a boozy  depression era gangster who craves art deco  if so  hamilton walkers might be the perfect restaurant for you  for everyone else  it might be worth a wait to see if the place can sort itself out    firstly  the decor is amazing  you really do feel like you have taken a step back into the 1930s with the extensive art deco trimmings and impeccably maintained dining room    however  food quality is quite inconsistent  for example  i ordered a prime rib sandwich with au jus  although the prime rib came out tender and well seasoned  i did ask for it to be medium  it was closer to medium well  with large parts of the slice grey from overcooking  fortunately it was prime rib so the result wasnt an inedible mess   the horseradish sauce it was served with was also underwhelming  tasting more like mayo than the astringent nasally bite of horseradish  their steak fries however are delicious and a high point of the meal   hamilton walkers is a relatively new restaurant with plenty of promise as well as room to grow 
living at big creek apartments was a nightmare for us  staff and leasing agents are truly unprofessional and ill mannered  even the staff of the real state parent holder  goldberg companies who you may have to deal with when your break your lease  is rude and incompetent   i totally disagree on the good aspects of living here  however  i strongly agree with all the bad reviews on this apartment complex  there are even three hidden negative reviews down towards the end of the review list where you can read more  i honestly dont recommend at all renting or leasing at this apartment complex  you pay premium for rent and taxes 
i went there with my girlfriend on friday night and had a pretty underwhelming experience  to start with  service was far too leisurely  our server disappeared for ten minutes between every interaction right up until the final twenty minute wait to get our bill  the decor and vibe was a little uptight and there was no music  the lack of music and the half filled restaurant set the stage for periods of awkward silence that made me yearn for the cool vibrant atmosphere of a houstons    here are the dishes we ordered with a small commentary and star ranking  grilled artichoke   swimming in oil and just tasted of grilled olive oil   veal osso buco   the veal is not bad but it was served with bland rice pilaf    lamb shank   not bad  tender braised lamb and onions on some bland spaghetti    spaghetti bolognese   the spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce tasted good but the pool of oil on the bottom of the plate made for an unappetizing finish      escargot   they tasted fine but they just seemed old fashioned  they tasted just like the garlic butter escargot i had on a cruise ship in 1988    
everything was very good but nothing really blew me away  this may sound strange  but the food came out of the kitchen startlingly fast   almost as if they they didnt actually cook anything to order  the service was good and the decor was interesting 
came on a friday early evening  wouldnt seat us until the entire party was there  not a good way to start  but the bar staff was good and they did seat us promptly    on a one aside shame on the aria concierge for saying they had vegan options there werent    anyways may i recommend the foie gras custard as a must order  as for the main course i went for a fish dish that was executed very well  the waiter was great and helped accommodate our vegan friends  definitely a place to go to
wow  i never had been in sprouts till i had to take my grandfather to the store   we went through all the rows of nuts  seeds  sweets and dried fruits   sprouts has a great assortment for the munchies  healthy ones too   the veggie area was clean and had great sales going on   this past week  88 cents for certain veggies   however  there wasnt a huge variety of breads and the fruit juices were way overpriced   the store itself was really clean and the staff was really friend   we didnt go through all the rows  so will just have to go back by myself to shop 
liqueur or ice cream   what   i dont have to decide which one to have  it comes together and i can try any of the flavors before i buy my cup   well  ok  if you say so   choices included the following liqueurs vodka  tequila  kahlua  and bourbon   i went with the chocolate bourbon ice cream   i loved it   friends of mine had one with vodka which one of them kept saying   i cant taste the vodka  however  this is the same person  who has had two apple vodka drinks and kept saying it was just apple juice not drinks therefore  lees is doing something right with the vodka in the ice creams   its a small location yet seems to work for the area   the staff there was friendly and helpful   and you get a punch card   buy 8 scoops  get one free  
a friend of mine had a coupon for uncorked  so we decided to go there for some wine and dinner   first  really hard to find but it was a nice setting   secondly  guests just sit and wait for the waitress to come around who was really nice  bartneder probably should have said hello or welcome when we entered but didnt    we ordered flights  which i had the fizzy bubbley and loved it  the white flight was ok   usually the waiter tells alitte bit more about the wines but didnt   the food was good  cant really screw up macroni and cheese which really went well with the wines   if you want a pretty quiet place to have wine and some food and good company its nice   worth it  only maybe if you had a coupon not really sure i wouldve spent  75 again  
one of the best pizza i have ever had  we took the payless special pizza  everything was so fresh  big like   
britney was awesome   the whole feel of the show is amazing  great sets  costumes and stunts   her dancers are very high energy and britney too   the theater is stunning with the huge screen spanning the entire stage area and beyond   the lobby in this theater was great too  highlighting and displaying many of britneys iconic performance costumes    there is also a britney store in the miracle mile right near the theater for all of your britney shopping needs 
if someone is reading this review listen very carefully  you have a tough decision you must make if you are on this side of town and craving korean  cafe gang ha  or takamatsu  both korean  a city block apart  only one can rule them all    lets go     cafe gang ha   positives      stronger korean flavors   more unique sidedishes    has dishes you cant get at takamatsu   du boki being my personal fave    open til the wee hours of 2am  negatives     restaurant is dark boarder line eery and less welcoming   does not have bbq in the tables   crappy korean soap oprahs blaring on tv  takamatsu   positives   fantastic restaurant atmosphere bright and open  full sushi bar in addition to your regular korean favorites  sashimi salad is amaze balls shot out to chef john      bbq at table   negatives   service is can sometimes be subpar     message for the white people   theyre korean  dont expect them to come over with a fake smile asking   hows everything tasting so far     every 5 minutes  no  this is not tgi fridays     flavors are sometimes not as deep   not as spicy as regular korean  if you dont like spice could also be a positive   i give both restaurants 5 stars because i love korean good or bad  i go to both so take it from me  takamatsu is the place you go to on a weekend if your with a companion and want to have a great night  cafe ga hang is the one you go to during the week solo after work  just to enjoy a great meal 
super cute and classy place  i cant wait to try their fondue experience next week  they have daily specials posted  the chocolates are so beautiful you almost dont want to eat them  i think i will have to try a slice of cake sooner than later  and          they serve my absolute favorite coffee  illy         how exciting  so the matcha bars are pretty amazing  those chocolate shortbread cookies are to die for  had some with my coffee this morning  and that white chocolate lemon truffle  bonbon was good  i love lemon  i wish they would do something like ethels lemon satin     mmmmmm  my son enjoyed their chocolate worms  too cute       cant wait to come back   the employee yesterday was very helpful and knew the product well  good job 
ok so im only dinging this place one star because the staff seems lazy and slow and the prices are a bit pricey  def just a once in a while treat place    the pizza is always fresh and the salads are ok  theyre a little stingy on the dressing so just ask for extra   i love how you can choose your style of sauce and toppings and such  i love their meatballs  and how they have roasted garlic   the beers on tap are always nice and cold   good location but never any parking 
went to the bristlecone bar and had a few beers before taking a ride on the chairlift   bartender was friendly  we wish we wouldve ate there instead of the lower mt charleston lodge  all their food that came out looked tasty and came out fast   the chairlift ride was refreshing  got chilly getting up there  brrrrrrr lol  good thing i had someone to snuggle up with in my chair  hehe nice little getaway from the city  wish they had some live music 
its been a while since i last went here but the experience was so unforgettable i just have to write this  so we went for blue crab and they were out  ordered another crab n they were out  so i ordered their king crab n it was overcooked  super salty  the staff was very rude  horrible service  horrible food  spent way too much money for such a horrible experience  never gone back since 
i really hate giving this place such a low rating but man  theyre just not consistent on the food  the owner is real friendly and the staff is ok     when we first started coming here the place was exceptional  we loved it for breakfast  then it just started seeming very inconsistent   they would offer peppers with your potatoes and then they started up charging if you wanted it  understandable  the steaks tho  omg  the first few times we went they were nice and juicy and tasted fresh  now     theyre tough and very poor quality  im not a fan of their biscuits and gravy  it has a weird taste and texture to it  last few times our steaks were overcooked  poor quality and horrible  eggs were also undercooked and toast wasnt even toasted   its unfortunate because we loved this place  now i dont even go there 
this place is an absolute joke  do not buy your car here or get your car services here  i bought my car brand new at this place and youd think theyd treat you good right  after my car was paid for they treat you like the horrible step child  i am never treated with good customer service and the wait for an oil change is ridiculous  i was sent a survey and i wrote an honest review and needless to say it was not a good one   so some guy named paul calls me and offers to make it up to me and fully detail my car inside and out  and he said theyd give me a loaner vehicle for the day  he also told me to call him when im ready to set up the appointment  well today was the day  i even asked him when i called if he was sure today was a good day  if not i can do friday  so i get there and they cant locate a loaner for me  after waiting there for 15 minutes and then asking me to come back on friday  what a joke  i will never ever buy another car here again and after my service package i paid for comes to an end  i will take my car elsewhere  this place is very unprofessional  disrespectful of your time  they are liars  they dont care that they take your money and treat you like scum  its awful  this entire experience from the moment i bought my car to the services to the customer service  everything sucks 
this place gets 2 stars just because the staff was super friendly     the burger patties were on salt overload  geezuz  i think mine was just salt with a side of beef  that special sauce on my burger wasnt good  nor were those fry sauces  i guess when youre used to in n out spread nothing compares     those fries were hard  cold and salty as well  someone cooking just had have been salt happy   finally tried this place and id rather suffer going through a casino to eat at the  other  steak burger joint  this place is even pricier than the  other  place  waste of  20 for 2 people  blah  we couldnt even eat our meals  garbage it was 
great comedy show  def a must see  i would so see him again  carrot top is hilarious and def made me laugh so hard i thought id pee myself  the way he just talks and fumbles around that stage is just silly and hilarious  i will seeing him again in the near future  the house was a full house and i see why  you must see this guy  great show      love the videos playing as well why youre waiting for the show to start  nice touch 
very sad that this place sucks because its so close to me and wished i couldve been a regular customer  this place has a dirty uneasy feel to it and the food is eh   tried it a couple times but not interested in wasting my time nor money here anymore  the staffs english is so poor i can barely understand them and their communication is poor 
way over priced       service is horrible every time ive gone  my check for 4 people was  200 and it wasnt worth it at all   the waitresses are very unfriendly and very pushy  um no i dont need you up in my food every minute  i can turn my own meat and dont tell me how i want my meat cooked  very rude  some people like myself like certain meats caramelized  and man are they stingy with their corn  this is supposed to be an all you can eat menu according to which combo you choose and we chose the most expensive one and were allowed one corn thing  wth  you can keep your dried up corn and your horrible staff and i def will not be recommending this place to anyone   waste of time and money 
good pastries  breads  always fresh  staff is not very friendly or welcoming but good thing i just stop in and grab what i want and get it bagged up   i like the steamed buns with the meat inside  the spongy cakes are pretty light and fluffy   i wish they stayed open a little later     but i just gotta get there earlier  lol
ok  soooooooooo ive never had a 5star experience at dimsum ever      until i found this little hidden gem  the server was uber friendly and made some amazing suggestions  i highly recommend their seasonal snap pea leaves with garlic sauce  she recommended it and it was fantastic  we had the pork shumai  shrimp ball with sugarcane   sweet rice cake  the dim sum noodles  chinese broccoli  the snap pea leaves with garlic  beef broccoli  steamed shrimp dumplings and the mushroom  spinach steamed dumplings     yes  we over ordered but it was good leftovers   nice clean place with cute wall aquariums and clean bathrooms      highly recommended and will return   
outstanding  i came into vals place  i was a little nervous cause i had just came from a different tattoo shop that i had a bad experience in    val was very professional and kind she made me feel welcomed  very light handed  very detailed the best part of her professional tattoo is you get every min you pay for  when you are a customer of hers she stays focused on you    i give her five stars cause i will recommend her to anyone   thanks again val and be blessed
by far the worst goodwill customer experience i have ever had  employees were rude and the manager was worse  my sil and i were getting her a tv and some other necessities for her new apartment  as she finally picked out a tv    a very heavy tv mind you  i asked an employee for help and he just walked away    although they had a huge selection of various items  which was awesome  we got everything we needed for her apartment at a decent price  everything was so organized and we had no problem finding her other things    thus  i will not be returning to this location in regards to horrible customer service and unhappy employees  i want to enjoy shopping  not dread it 
in a span of 10 minutes i watched 4 workers go outside to smoke a cigarette  i stood inline for 5 minutes while workers chatted in the back doing whatever it is they do when they arent working  thankfully a car went through the drive thru so they had to actually work and saw me  otherwise i would have starved to death  actually i would have just left  terrible service  feel bad the owner pays these people 
i went to and i have to say first impressions where not that good the decor  was somewhere between chic and tacky  however when i got my ribeye i really liked it  for dessert i had the greek doughnuts and i have no complaints about them  however it was very pricey  if you do go their get the flaming cheese  it is amazing i love it when they set it on fire and say opa 
the food here is amazing  everything is cooked then and there so its fresh as can be  the pictures and wall art make it seem nice and cozy  the staff are friendly and you can call to place your order in and pick it up 
great place  great flavours   7 chili  cilantro and strawberry salsa are must try   in my first visit  i tried chicken tinga and a burro  the meat was well cooked and juicy    place was small  but nice ambience    the neighborhood was litle shady but  the quality of food defeats all those negative factors    definitely recommended   ps   the place is open late till 11pm  even though yelp hours shows 9pm 
this was the biggest mistake i have made       do not use this company         2 missing boxes  over 1000 dollars worth of property gone  broken items  shattered  the truck was packed and totes were crushed  not even my belongings and i could see the damage  the truck that delivered was not even employed by west coast  file a claim  for  60 cents per pound   my bed scratched and dirty  glenn promised me the move would be  seamless   after i saw the reviews on here i asked refund on deposit policy i should have went with my gut   zero stars  choose     another company      you will regret using this company  i promise 
the food was amazing  you might have to wait  but boy is it worth the experience  try the pulled pork and wet ribs  its priced the same as most bbq joints and its well deserved  a  bbq joint 
dry     frozen      patty      sad   the costumer service was excellent  the beer was fantastic  but the burger was like a patty from the the frozen section at a grocery store 
yay  chinese food in arizona that doesnt make you sick   im a shrimp fanatic so if you are like me you have to go here  they have breaded shrimp  raw shrimp  crab cake shrimp  bacon wrapped shrimp  and all the things at every other normal chinese buffet on the planet  but not in phoenix  this place is really good   i think the lunch buffet was only about 8 10 bucks and its definitely the best place ive found so far here 
ive been to a few nice freshii locations  by rosedale station and eglinton station  so i went into this one  horrible idea  the restaurant was dirty and run down and the food hidden behind a big wall so you cant see what theyre doing  i also got half the food that i got in the other restaurants for the same bowl    for the same ridiculous price of course  disappointing 
if youre looking for a quick bite to eat with unbeatable prices and outstanding food  moms is the place to go  i love that this is a locally owned  mom and pop  restaurant with a wonderfully quaint atmosphere  the quality  and quantity   of the food cannot be beat  especially for the price you pay  id chose breakfast at moms over any other restaurants   hands down 
always great food  nice wine selection  we always sit at the bar  heather is amazing  love this place 
its a little out of the way for me  but its always worth the drive  i always end up eating at taco bell  but i never know why i dont go to dell taco more often  the steak tacos are delicious and the crinkle fries are yummy  throw in a churro and youve got a great meal  wish it was closer  but im never sorry i made the drive 
rex is the man  we already know his hands work the magic of a thousand merlins  but his mind  his memory is unbelievable   somehow  he remembered me from my first visit  maybe he read my yelp review  but he remembered that he charged me the full  38 price tag  so on this visit  he charged me  4 less  on top of the yelp discount  hes already one of the nicest guys on the planet  but wow   as far as the massage  this was probably the best one ive had  i went in with bobby  misti  and terri and they recommended lee  no offense to rex  but i think lees level of pressure was pretty much perfect the whole time  at bobbys suggestion  he started on the shoulders first  excellent call  my shoulders have been aching since this morning and it felt so great   in my limited experience  i think what sets bfs apart is how nice and clean the place is  granted  its a relatively new establishment  also  you really get a chance to relax in there  they play some pretty awful elevator music  but in that setting  it kinda works  i almost fell asleep a few times  almost   i dont get massages that often  but its confirmed  bfs is my spot 
i wouldnt consider this to be my favorite barriques out of the 5 but it is really nice  each barriques sort of has its only feel and this one is a bit more mainstream than the other two i have reviewed  anyway  the place is really nice and kept pretty clean etc  the staff has generally been pretty nice there but i have had one bad experience  as always  great coffee however  it is a little hidden and i wish it was more pronounced where it is  all in all a good place to go for some afternoon coffee 
this is most definitely our favorite korean bbq in the las vegas area  we used to go to sura in china town but never again  i swear the food is better and better every time we visit and there is no denying that the price cant be beaten  we travel from the mountains edge area in southwest vegas to enjoy dinner here almost on a weekly basis  the food comes out ridiculously fast  just wish i could try those cajun fries on the menu   last night our server was jearica  sp   and she did a great job  super friendly and had great recommendations  always a must order is the signature steak  brisket and most definitely the roast beef 
a great little restaurant that once inside doesnt feel like its in a strip mall or next to an auto shop  all the food ive tried is been great just ignore the little kitchen gift shop upfront but seems out of place  my piano music on the weekends is a nice touch in the atmosphere is lively and upbeat  great date spot 
heard that this was buffet underwent renovation and a change in their menu  i was pleased that the buffet came with open bar  on select beer   wine    although my lunch meal was free  i felt that this buffet was alright   nothing too special   the asian dumplings  french toast  and lobster ravioli was pretty good   other than that  just a typical buffet   the buffet at the wynn was better and worth my money 
i normally come to vegas yearly and this visit i wanted to stay at a new casino   what i like about the linq is the modern hip interior in the public areas  casino  lobby etc    upon checking in  my boyfriend and i got lost trying to find the elevators to our room which was named a specific zone   we even asked a few employees on the casino floor and they were no help as they didnt know   we were greeted with a very clean room that was nicely decorated  very hip and modern   i loved their bathroom  shower which had all white tile on the floors and walls and a nicely back lit mirror which is definitely nice for applying makeup   we worked out a few days at the gym which was pretty spacious and hardly ever packed   they provide ice cold water  dry towels and soaked towels  to cool  which was great   pick up for ride share and shuttles were in a very weird area  located in a side alley by the parking garage which i wouldnt want to be at at night  casino dealers were friendly and the cocktail waitresses were hard to find   i guess the casino might have been short staffed   overall   the linq is nicely centrally located  where you can basically walk to caesars  flamingo  the venetians and the fashion show mall   a bonus is the promenade on linq property where they are restaurants  candy shops  bars and the high roller  i went on the high roller a few years back and you definitely get a nice view of the lv strip  especially at night   i went during mothers day where they had a very good deal but regular pricing will be on the    side 
i was recommended to try this buffet over the bellagio buffet and i wasnt disappointed   this buffet has a wide selection of different tasty cuisines and the best selection of desserts you can ask for   from gelato to creme brulee  im always satisfied with this place 
heard lines were pretty long here and we were hoping we wouldnt be another victim as we came here for dinner on a wed night   they cashier said the wait would be 45 mins 1 hr but we ended up waiting for 30  we thought we could do the 24 hr buffet pass which included caesars  at additional cost on top of set price  and other buffets along the strip but heard that we would be paying more since we came during dinner  we passed on that and just bought dinner at regular price  around  50  which is pretty pricey   the restaurant itself is very intimate  fancy furnishings and dim lighting   like other buffets  caesars had a variety of different cuisines  asian  american  mexican  italian and of course dessert  their seafood bar had alaskan crabs  scallops  clams  crawfish  shrimp and oysters and more    i really enjoyed the lasagne and the seafood bar mostly   the desserts were pretty good  they even had a crepe bar    for the food and quality  i thought the price is pretty  steep   out of the buffets ive been to on the strip  i still recommend the buffet at wynn or aria  for brunch   
always amazing    anytime i want a burrito i come here  its always perfect and always so delicious 
i had to get my coffee fix before my flight  guy at register was very nice and friendly 
ive always loved madhouse  its a 24  7 coffee shop and im a coffee addict so it was meant to be  i got a monkey mocha and my boyfriend got a vanilla latte  he asked for it hot but he got it iced which is the only reason im giving madhouse 4 stars  were easy people we dont complain much  just give us the coffee and were good to go 
red square is another good place for happy hour in mandalay bay   i love that the bar is cold  so as not to warm your drinks   thats a great idea   i had whatever was on happy hour special  and remember it being strong   plus  i also ordered calamari  which for  5 was fine  but nothing special   though that was also placed on the ice  so it chilled fast  it was just something  to go along with our drinks so that we would not end up too drunk   but the drinks  i think i had three  were great  and id return anytime 
dr  chelian rocks  i was referred to dr  c by my primary dentist  this is my 2nd round of braces  as i had my first set removed in 2008 after completing treatment and a few months later i moved to california  my retainer broke   the orthodontists out there wanted a kidney to make me another one so i passed and sadly my teeth shifted significantly  i moved back to vegas last year and went back to my previous ortho for a consult but i was hesitant to start treatment but dr  c came highly recommended by my dentist so i gave him a try  im sure glad i did    dr  c is so nice  he explains everything so thoroughly  hes friendly  and funny  hes make you feel right at home  its a very nice and laid back  yet professional environment   the staff is awesome  too  all of the ladies are super nice and friendly  after my consultation with dr  c  it was a no brainer for me  i started my treatment right away  dr  c takes pride in his work and he is meticulous about getting your teeth as straight and near perfect as possible  i strongly recommend aloha ortho to anyone in need of a good ortho  the office is quite a trek from my home but thankfully i only have to go about once a month or so  so its not bad 
horrible service  they messed up on my brothers reservation last time were they charged him twice and it took almost a month for him to get his money back  they told him they would upgrade him the next time he came  we even had proof of them charging him twice  and when we get here and request the upgrade they said they had no record of it  they called the manager curtis to help and he was rude  didnt even let my brother finish his sentence before he cut him off his exact words  its not happening  and walked away  this place looks and is very unprofessional  they need someone from corporate to come look at things here 
this chipotle was the worst  first of all the attitude of the staff was not friendly and second the bug in my lettuce was disgusting  it literally made it all bad for the family   chipotle needs to address this problems that is been going on for a while  and the refund was not enough reason to be satisfied 
excellent food  excellent service  the chorizo was delicious and cooked perfect  beans and rice were delicious
food is always excellent  service is great  no matter what time of day  happy hour is a great time to go 
wait  i havent reviewed this place  allow me to correct that   vanguard lounge is an integral part of the revitalization of downtown las vegas  specifically  its one of the gem spots in the so called fremont east area  situated right next to insert coin s   its in the perfect location  insert coin s  may provide the geeky games  but their drink selection is nothing compared to vanguard   if a crafty cocktail is what you are after  look no further  its not on the menu  but i like their hard 8  is that what its called  ask bobby y  hell tell you  they also provide classic concoctions like the aviation  the drinks here never disappoint   i still have a groupon for this place and need to use it soon  even without one  they have happy hours  4 7pm i think   where cocktails are only  7  ok so thats not a bargain basement price  but these are specialty cocktails were talking about here   vanguard lounge is well worth the visit 
am i really a fan of the post office  not really  but i feel like this location deserves four stars simply because its the main location for las vegas  from what ive experienced  this is the go to place if you want your stuff delivered quickly  im guessing its because mail from the other locations have to go through this facility anyway  so youre getting a head start by going to the source   plus  this spot works for me because its right down the road from work  this place should also get you in and out quicker than other usps offices  there are simply more employees and more counters here  on the other hand  there is an easy to use self service kiosk in the center area  im sure most other post offices have them too  but its worth mentioning  i usually use that unless i have something unusual to ship  like today  
i had absolutely no expectations going into the show   that way  i would be neither disappointed nor    appointed    jk   well im happy to report that bette midler puts on an amazingly hilarious and enjoyable show   she is truly a world class entertainer and perfect for the las vegas strip   the production is also of high quality with excellent lighting  backgrounds  and props   i was surprised to discover how potty mouthed she is   do not bring your kids   she may also alienate some people with her left wing jokes   funny stuff   incidentally  the highlight for me was definitely  the rose 
if theres any local business worthy of an omg  its snow ono  holy crap  ive been wanting to try them for the longest time  im so glad i finally made the trek down to the fresh52 farmers market on sunday  it worked out perfectly because sloppi jos was also there   snow ono has so many flavors  its overwhelming  i decided to entrust my order to marianne  her current favorite flavor combo is melona  lilikoi  and lychee  with condensed milk drizzled over the top  let me tell you  snow ono shave ice is redonkulous  there really is nothing like it  maybe im just not familiar with real hawaiian shave ice  but this is as good as it gets imho   my recurring sore throat had me ordering a small  but i can totally see myself scarfing down a large when the vegas heat gets here  but i wouldnt wait if i were you  track down marianne and roxanne and their magical snow bus and get some snow ono asap 
very good pizza joint   i had the  pizza of the month   which happened to be the bbq chicken   it was good  but i felt like it didnt really showcase the type of pizza that would benefit from the grimaldis style   as we were leaving  i saw the pizza a couple had ordered   pepperoni with extra sauce   and it looked amazing   i will definitely return and order a pizza that is a little less  busy    that way  i can really enjoy the buffalo mozzarella that they use 
i enjoyed the show  but to be honest  its not my cup of tea   on a  diva  level  frank marino certainly fits the bill  each time he came out in between acts  he was wearing a different gown and he completely rocked them  he definitely knows how to run the show and keep things moving  i found a couple of his jokes to be a little crude  but overall he is very funny and entertaining   as for the performances  most of them were brilliant impersonations  i thought the mariah carey was a little bland  but the celine dion  liza minelli  and tina turner were spot on  just to name a few that stood out in memory   the problem for me is that although they are all pretty good at what they do  it started to get a little tired about two thirds of the way through   on a final note  i absolutely loved  what makes a man a man   in a show full of laughs  this one brought some emotional gravity to anchor it all down  by itself  that final song almost brought me up to four stars  almost 
this is the best fitness facility   no question   i joined 3 years ago and have had amazing results   ive lost body fat and put on a lot of muscle   they preach from the beginning that its about getting stronger and not to worry about your overall weight  that was a real change for me   basically  you work your butt off but have a blast doing it   kickboxing  strength training  nutriion  all in one package  its like getting a personal trainer but doesnt cost as much   i love the classes and the upbeat atmosphere 
buyer beware  this place has some of most expensive simple burgers    i ordered the burgerfi and by the time i added cheese and bacon it was up to   8 54 for a very small berger  fries and a coke bumped it up to a  15 56 meal    not worth it  i expect this prices in dc  nyc  miami  not in ohio   
my bestfriend brought me and my boyfriend here when we went to visit her in vegas  shes always talking about how good this place was so we had to try it   amongst the three of us we got 3lbs of crawfish  mild hotness  2lbs of shrimp  one order of calamari  and an order of cajun fries  we got the same sauce for the crawfish and shrimp  which was deeeelicious   honestly  i liked their sauce more than the boiling crab  and whats even better is that theres no 2 3 hour wait   unlike boiling crab  no matter what day of the week or what time of the day  there will always be a wait  once we got into this restaurant  the waitress asked us how many and seated us within minutes  if you like garlic  this is the place to go  their sauce is thick and flavored with garlic  it was just perfect   if youre ever in vegas  you should definitely give this place a try 
sorry guys  this place is as bad as it gets   we sat at the counter and watched the servers argue with each other and then the kitchen staff and then the hostess the entire time   i feel like we were waiting for a brawl to break out   we sat for a good 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged   we ordered the steak and eggs with home fries along with a half order of biscuits and gravy to share   i asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare   i love my steak rare but this thing came out beyond mooing    it was also very under seasoned   i also didnt get my home fries they gave me hash browns instead   at one point one of the younger servers told me  im sorry they usually dont fight like this  this girl was genuinely embarrassed  we just picked at our food for about 15 minutes  paid and then left    never again   try the perk eatery  40th st  cafe or the original breakfast house instead 
had my watch battery replaced for  12   it took 5 minutes   fast and courteous   ill be back 
i am grieving the loss of manager ryan but wish him the best in his new venture   that being said all the staff here is great and im proud to call this location my coffee spot 
we were hankering for a new taco place   we were super excited to see that there was a new two hippies    upon arrival the place had zero customers   i asked the owner how long she had been open and had some small talk with her   she described some of the items on the menu and it all sounded super good   she is very nice    i ordered a passion fruit lemonade   the lemonade is definitely worth just stopping in   not too sweet  not too tart and its blended  i ordered carne asada taco which was  alright    sorta bland    i also ordered a chicken taco which was better and finally the shredded pork taco   stick with the pork   it has a great green chili sauce on it   overall great flavor  im rating this place at 4 stars because its low priced  decent food and the owner was a really sweet lady 
great wine and beer selection   lee is a great asset to this store   he really knows his wine and beer selection and can make a good recommendation if you are in need of guidance 
i would not recommend this place  it is located next to a business that is very loud and plays loud music  also  they did not give the full hour and kept stopping during massage to greet other customers  very disruptive and made us agitated rather than relaxed  at the end they pressured us into tipping  10 or  15 for the massages which was a 50  tip     many other places on spring mountain road  please reconsider going to this one 
ac went out yesterday   called sure temp this morning at 8 30 am and kevin was out at the house by 1pm   diagnosed and fixed in less than 30 minutes  very professional and extremely reasonable   would highly recommend them to anyone and plan to use in the future for any maintenance needs 
always up to standard  everything seems to be fresh   especially the fruits sections   the only complaint that the line could get a bit overwhelming on saturdays 
the good  dirty young girls serve you with tattoos and the beer selection is excellent as well as served cold  good spot to watch a game and drink     bad  the burgers sound good but are tasteless and the bread they serve them on sucks  bagged french fries are you kidding   the ugly    watching the staff at work is like watching high school kids  at lunch time plenty of drama and posing  i see many strippers in these girls future  
riddle me this  my yelpizzles who have already been to and reviewed this place  why did it take me so long   i think i have a new favorite lunch spot  well see how long it takes for me to get tired of it  as it stands  i went for lunch yesterday and i returned today  its that delicious   yesterday  i was looking for something somewhat healthy and found parsley through yelp  i got a beef shawarma salad to go and i ate it at the parking lot along sunset where people watch planes take off and land  or do other activities not related to aviation   i dont think i even saw a single plane because i was too busy enjoying my salad   today  i went back to try chicken instead  but once i saw what the guy ahead of me ordered  i basically told the lady   i want that   that being a gigantic half chicken  half beef shawarma wrap  for a slightly lower price  it seems like you get more food  what i like about the wrap is how it reminds me of the doner kebab  something we dont really have in las vegas   for messy hands sake  ill probably stick with the salad  in any case  i feel like you just cant go wrong with parsley mediterranean grill 
i love rei   i dont love rei prices   still  rei is the first place i think about whenever i feel the urge to pick up new outdoorsy types of stuffs  i usually check their web site first to see what is available  i then proceed to internally shout some sort of expletive when i see how much it costs   every now and then  ill find a sale or clearance item that doesnt break the bank  i like to order things online and have them shipped to the store  they have one of the best return policies in the business  so im never afraid of not liking the product   on my most recent visit  i was there to exchange some toe shoes for the next size up   theyre actually vibram fivefingers kso treksports  but i call them toe shoes   the girl who helped me was extremely helpful and friendly  i agree with some people in that its sometimes tough to get someone available to help you  luckily  that wasnt the case on this occasion   a final word on rei prices  you really do get what you pay for  i absolutely love my rei half dome 2  best tent ive ever used  though im far from being an expert 
goldilocks doesnt serve amazing food  goldilocks doesnt serve crappy food  its just right   ok that was a labored analogy to the fairy tale  ive been to this restaurant twice and ive enjoyed it both times  the first time a few years ago  i had the classic filo  tosilog  breakfast   tocino  sinangag  garlic fried rice  and itlog  egg   its pretty hard to mess that up  so i remember it being pretty good   flash forward to yesterday  i went with a meetup group for their weekend breakfast buffet  it costs  7 99 for ayce and soda  coffee  tea  thats a pretty good deal considering their breakfast items are actually good  i recently did nanay glorias buffet during breakfast and id have to say goldilocks is a notch better  for one thing  the eggs at goldilocks are not cooked over hard and are still runny  for me  thats kind of a prerequisite for a ___silog type of breakfast  they have all the favorites too   daing  tocino  longanisa  corned beef hash  salted egg  chicken adobo  and of course over easy itlog and sinangag  i didnt try their champorado though   one thing about their breakfast buffet  i guess they are normally a  turo turo  place i e  you point at what you want and they add it to your plate  its the same way for the breakfast buffet  its just that you can get as much as you want and keep returning   and return i will  its quite a drive for me to just get breakfast  and i dont usually eat breakfast as it is  but so far its the best filo breakfast option i know about 
i saw briana  shes a doll  i went with the reviews on yelp and found they were right on  she did color  trim and styled  and you know  i left there looking years younger  my husband put a picture of me on his screen saver    blush   well  thanks briana for your exclusive touch 
a bit of a trek from where we were  but props to this store for being open on labor day weekend  the venues a little small  the staff a little harried despite the lack of a line and the limited menu items  despite the wait  we managed to obtain one of each of the cupcakes to try   a little dry  but they were tasty enough that i couldnt believe they were vegan  would come again if it was closer and  or the wait wasnt so long 
their pizza is delish     curly fries are hot   fresh  bartenders are pretty fast too  i liked this place   i started a bar crawl here   it was chill 
wonderful old word style public market  if you are looking for food by the abundance from all food groups this is the place to pick it up    from raw fruits and vegetables to fish  poultry and beef  this place is great  they have anything your palate could desire  one warning though eat before you go    do not go here hungry 
went here last night with my husband and daughter for the first time  ambiance was great  cant wait until it cools down to sit on the patio  i got the meatloaf and it wasnt dry at all  daughter got the filet and it was cooked perfectly with a little crunch on the outside and my husband got the prime dip  which is huge    all were great  only suggestion i have is to please add a gravy option that doesnt have mushrooms  there were so many dishes we wanted to try but wont because of the mushroom gravy  otherwise  service was great and we had a lovely time 
first thing is first  marsha is wonderful     my husband and i booked our wedding with marsha in april and the venue that we picked  hawaiian gardens  hadnt even been started yet   because of this  marsha did a cut in price and did not make me pick the area at the venue that i wanted until the day before my wedding     the problem was and still remains to be the photographer used   i cannot for the life of me remember his name   he was extremely rushed as he had another engagement to get to   we purchased the full photo package for around  700 and i got an hour with the photographer and copy rights to the photos taken   the problems are as follows  1  all the group shots are blurry  2  there are no pictures of the bride  groom and daughter  3  the one picture of me  the bride  with my family has chairs in it and are not nearly as good as the many pictures taken with the grooms family  not to mention that its a tad blurry  4  many of the pictures are so dark that i myself have to edit them  5  the photos taken with the grooms family that included my daughter  my 13 year old daughter is standing with her legs open   i feel that if the photographer was not so rushed  he wouldve noticed this  6  there is one picture of the grooms family with just his mother and brother  and my eyes are closed  7  my mother specifically asked for a picture of her and i kissing and what i got included before and after the kiss  and 8   there is an electrical panel on the wall that is open and ruins every one of the pictures of people  including me  walking down the aisle   i believe that its the photographers responsibility to pay attention to detail and i further believe that if he hadnt been so rushed  i wouldve gotten the photos i wanted and they wouldve been better   it hurts my heart everyday that there are no pictures of me  my husband and our daughter  none      granted i shouldve been more aware  but really   im the bride and completely out of it at the time of the pictures    at this time  nothing has been done about making it right   ive been told that there are some  canvas  pictures on the way but ive yet to receive them   i definitely did not get my moneys worth and am extremely disappointed 
it was my first time walking in downtown tempe and decided to go somewhere for a quick bite   i loved how the name looked like a little scrabble piece and how the table  numbers  were letter themed   i ordered a green juice called  the hulk  and split a very yummy  warm blueberry muffin with my sister   the juice was good  and some of the ingredients were spinach  banana and yogurt  i believe   only little funny incident was when we stood up to leave and i had a good 3 quarters of my juice left   i looked away and looked back and my juice was missing   points for them  for being so quick to clean up and i was able to catch the server before he tossed my juice   no harm  no foul 
went for lunch  the food was good  the service was so slow  very  very slow   all the enjoyment of the food was lost  wasnt really crowded  i have no idea if there was a problem  the waiter was uncommunicative 
weve been to hearthstone several times and we really enjoy the restaurant  tonight we tried three new  to us  dishes  and one old favorite  surprisingly  only the old favorite was less than perfect  the new   the crab cake appetizer was one large  very meaty crab cake with a nice crust  that came with a tasty slaw   the rock shrimp lettuce cups had beautiful pieces of lettuce to wrap around very tasty shrimp  the fried chicken turned out to be four large pieces of juicy  mostly white meat chicken in an exceptionally addicting coating  all these were delicious  the disappointment was  the pasta shrimp  a dish i had had maybe four times previously  and each time it was the dish that i talked about for days after the meal and it was the dish that brought me back for more  i normally dont get spaghetti dishes  but i got this one because this dish used to have a light  distinctive sauce that i couldnt get enough of  tonight the dish was different  tonight the sauce was a heavy  creamy  spicy sauce  they warned me about the spice and the spice was not a problem  in fact the dish itself was not really a problem  it was good  the problem was that the dish was different than it had been the four previous times i ordered it  it was creamy and heavy  not light  and thats not what it used to be  so i was disappointed because i ordered expecting one thing based on my previous visits to the restaurant  but i got something that was entirely different 
good service  good french toast  good quantities  i liked the hash browns i tasted  my dining companion liked the eggs benedict  the only slight negative was the coffee wasnt the greatest  its definitely a place to try when youre looking for breakfast but its a big menu and the lunch items might also be worth looking at 
nice park close to town  chandler was a very clean town  easy to find streets and parks
i write this review as my boyfriend is next to me in a food coma  he just got back from a hiking trip and wanted a burger and fries  so i jumped on yelp to see what we could find  after looking at a few places  we decided on rocket burger and subs  when we walked through the door we were greated right away  something i look for and think is very important  we were amazed at the soda selection  some sodas ive havent seen in years  they even have slush puppies    what     yeppers  they sure do  we both decided on the birch beer  sooooo good  i went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries  bf got a pastrami with cole slaw sandwich and fries  i have to agree with most on here and say the food here is outstanding  very fresh and full of flavor  the fries were not greasy nor the burgers salty  and i for one do not use or like salt very much  i love how the skin was left on the fries  very yummy  we will definitely be back when we have a craving for really good burgers and fries  oh and if you check in on yelp you get 10  off   
burgers and cajun fries are good    but the service here is fantastic     i was impressed by every person that i saw working here  genuinely awesome 
let me preface what im about to say with this   im 35 years old and until eating here i had never sent back a steak in my life  i love steak  i can eat it just about any way you make it    ordered the lollipop bone in ribeye  77 dollars and their signature cut   it was cooked perfectly on the inside but the outside was so burned crispy all i could taste was char burned steak  it was seriously inedible    my date had an 8 ounce filet  which was fantastic  i ended up sharing it with her    the clam chowder was awesome  some of the best ive ever had    the mashed potatoes were good as was the mac n cheese    service was above average    wont go back 
i know you cant expect much from jcpenny on black friday but the staff was horrible  i didnt get his name he was arrogant black hair male slightly built  i came to buy over 100 in clothes and 3000 in appliances but now im going to rc instead for my appliances there loss i guess  
ive always passed by this place and have even stopped in a few times but never seemed to find anything until today  im a huge fan of designer consignment because i personally never believe in paying retail  however i usually find this place pretty pricey and the inventory isnt always the greatest  some of the clothes look pretty worn and some have stains  however today i went in and picked up my first pair of loubs  only worn once  in basically brand new condition with all the originally packaging  retailed for  625 at neimans in the states  had original tags  but i got them for  475 with 10  off  still expensive but since they were in almost new condition with all the original packaging i i figured they were worth it  my boyfriend came with me and found a bunch of really nice stuff  tom ford dress shirt for  140  lacoste dress shirt for  20 on clearance  armani pants for  40 and a ralph lauren fall  winter coat for  220  the staff were not as friendly as im used to when i go shopping but they were nice enough to give my boyfriend 10  off his stuff  however i could have done with some friendlier service considering the 2 of us spent nearly a grand there within 30 minutes  overall we were both super happy with our purchases  everything was in great condition  but we will have to dry clean the jacket 
my boyfriend and i were looking for some yummy take out after seeing a write up about this place on toronto life  we went and grabbed a bunch of stuff to bring home for dinner  spent  100 on 3 desserts  2 entrees  1 appetizer  a panini  and a whole chicken   panini and chicken were intended for lunch for the upcoming week    the short rib empanadas and perogies were both tasty but reheated poorly as they came out super dry and difficult to eat  the truffle mac and cheese was tasty but almost smelled better and stronger than it really tasted  i wasnt super impressed as a huge truffle fan  the beef brisket shepherds pie was absolutely tasty and delicious  i would definitely go back for it  my boyfriend had the caramel apple crumble for dessert and he said it was very good  i myself had the strawberry rhubarb tart and i have to say it was one of the tastiest desserts ive had in awhile  better than the strawberry rhubarb pie i had at wandas pie in the sky the other day  overall the food was delicious considering it was pre made grocery meals  but obviously some foods reheat better than others  that being said you do pay for what youre getting  its not exactly cheap  but for people looking to indulge but still eat at home i think its a great option 
love this place  the burger with the robiola cheese is outstanding  but why change the menu so often  this pisses off regulars who come in expecting something they have been craving all week  not cool bar north  not cool at all 
meh  i figured spike lee would make better sandwiches  theres nothing wrong with lees banh mi per se  its just that there are so many other places in vegas that make better banh mi for the same price  why go to a chain when you can eat local  thats my philosophy anyway   granted  all we tried was the banh mi and their grand opening special 99c iced coffee  the iced coffee was more ice than coffee  im not sure why they bothered  judging from what the guy said  they offer this grand opening  special  and then rip us off with basically a cup of ice  he made it sound like they are only making it like that today because its a 99c special   there are other items on the menu that might be worth trying  fellow yelper  tony t  says that this location has way more stuff than other lees in california  if youve never been to a lees  its probably worth checking out  if just to see what the fuss is all about  otherwise  i see no reason to return   p s  i dont actually think this is a spike lee joint 
not sure i would pay for this show  but for free  it was great  my dads always been a beatles fan  so i picked up a couple of house seats tickets to take him   the show itself only lasts one hour  which is probably a tad short  but long enough for them to breeze through the major hits  pretty much every song is a crowd pleaser  thats how prolific the beatles were  the first half is mostly their earlier stuff  there is then a short intermission with an sf haight ashbury video montage  this transitions us into their hippie era  complete with sgt pepper style outfits   as a cover band  they are pretty good  from far away  i thought that paul actually looked like sir paul  john and paul sing most of the leads and they sounded pretty good  the lone song that george sang was also pretty good  but when ringo got on the mic   that sounded slightly comical  still  they do a great job and really get the crowd into it 
i booked a room here for a place to crash after last weekends beer festival  during check in  i discovered that we were getting a room across the bridge in the luna building  we drove around  parked in the underground lot  and took the convenient elevator to the top floor  everything great so far   the room surpassed my admittedly meager expectations  not sure if we got lucky or if they are all like this  it was very spacious and clean  the kitchenette has everything you might need  fridge  dishwasher  microwave  stove  the separate bedroom is large for the single king bed it houses  same thing for the bathroom  huge and bright with updated amenities  the balcony faced west and had a nice view of the lake  if there is one thing that needs attention  its the outdated tvs  at least there was one in both the living room and the bedroom   it later dawned on me that this building used to  or possibly still is  a condominium  the mailbox cluster out front was my first clue   my girlfriend and i ended up on the sofa bed  at first contact  it seemed like it would be terribly uncomfortable  but we both woke up the next morning enjoying a great nights sleep  perhaps that was the alcohol   my one complaint  why on earth would you ever  ever close the bridge  when we were walking from the room to the main village  we found that the bridge was closed until 6 30pm for a wedding  thats just a terrible idea   1  its very inconvenient for your guests  i admit that the walk around wasnt that bad in the end  but the idea that youre basically cutting your guests off from the majority of your resort is just silly   2  the bridge is so unfinished  why would you want to hold your wedding there  the security guy said it only happens a few times a year  how about never  its dumb  stop it   so yes  im allowing that to bring my rating down  we definitely had a nice stay  but the bridge thing is just bad business 
not the easiest place to find    but once you do  you wont be disappointed    the burgers are great that are cooked to your likings  the applebutter bbq burger is delicious and i highly recommend it  the employees are also very friendly     everyone go enjoy 
once again my order was screwed up  for the 2nd time the manager has to make a bigger deal out of than needed to be made  i wont be hot my back 
very good as always  ive never been disappointed at macayos  food is always consistent
love  love  love this place  this is my favorite spot to  eat  drink and be seen  from the decor  the interesting mix of people  and the chill vibe  az 88 has been my date night spot consistently since  2009 and i love it more and more every year  the drinks are quite amazing to say the least  the martinis are super potent with flavor and alcohol    definitely worth every penny  i am obsessed with the mai tai as well as the mojito    you can tell they dont use the dreaded sour mix  its mixed with quality ingredients    count on it  the drinks will take you there in no time  the food is soooo good  when i used to eat meat   the az88 chicken sandwich was my ish  the food is always seasoned well  hot and just smack yo momma good  i love going to the bathroom to watch myself in the mirrors that are everywhere  its so much to say about this place  you just have to go and see for yourself    your welcome   
i am not impressed  the food is uber bland and expensive for the portion sizes  i ordered the spicy pad thai with crispy tofu  i was specific about it being crispy and it was super soggy  to top it off  i paid something like  10 bucks  i am not a fan
as soon as i called in my order  i became obsessed   the customer service was amazing  they were courteous and friendly  which mean everything to me  i was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes  i got there in 7  and my food was ready    the place was very clean and smelled clean  which is also a plus for me  i loved the open kitchen area  which allows an ocd person like myself to check out everything that is going on  but nonetheless  i ordered tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce   it was sooooo good  everything  was cooked perfect  especially the tofu  i love fried  firm tofu and they delivered   the garlic sauce was good    a little sweet for my liking  but still good  and for  6 95  i was able to get leftovers popping    i am happy   the end
najette is amazing  i have only been there twice but i think im obsessed with her  i am a newbie in the waxing world so the thought of getting a full brazilian its kind of scary  but she put me at ease right away  her technique   skill   patience and her for perfection produces the most amazing waxing job  i was able to go 5 weeks in between a brazilian which ive never had that experience in the past and actually i could have went another week but i didnt want to wait that long  for you to seasoned waxies out there you know what i mean   lol  but i love this but im always able to get in whenever i need an appointment and im definitely a customer for life 
since we were staying at the wynn  the wife and i decided to have a late night drink here   the pearasol signature cocktail is highly recommended   i was kinda tired so dont remember much other than the fact the place was quiet and relaxing 
cute hole in the wall place   i got the traditional benny  it was good but my only grip was the canadian bacon was super thick  we are talking half an inch   pancakes are super big and generous   delicious and just airy enough   be sure to check in so you can get the yummy banana nut muffin 
we read all the reviews about reality floors and spoke with tom on a few occasions   he did give us a reasonable quote at first   we ignored the bad reviews because he explained that it was a disgruntled employee that worked the it part of their company so we did believe him    anyways  tom did send over a guy that did wonderful work on our floors   he was not part of the company he was actually an independent contractor that hasnt worked in awhile  but he said that tom called him and it was an emergency   luckily  we did not pay tom up front   we paid the actual estimate  for labor  that tom gave us to the independent contractor   we had to pay and order the materials after we tried to contact tom several times about when he would do it   luckily  this contractor was really nice and did an amazing job trying to get out laminate floors in  he even took off and put back on our baseboards without charge      so we havent heard from tom since he texted my boyfriend that he was in a car accident  which it was the 2nd accident in a couple weeks    so do not go with this company  but the good side is that this contractor was awesome   dont buy into toms bs 
over rated buffet i have ever been  expected a lot from this place but was disappointed at the menu items  pastry items was below average  will never visit this place again 
this hotel is beautiful and would love to give it 5 stars  however  i cannot due to one person  ted  who i believe is the supervisor   manager  is awful  i have stayed here many times and expect sheraton service and he is always giving excuses and trying to blame problems on anyone but himself  every time ive stayed here ive had run ins with him  not pleasant  and way too much attitude    update  recently stayed here again and had to knock this place down a star  it took the shuttle an hour to pick up  when we got there they couldnt find our keys  and then made us wait 30 more minutes  not even an apology out of the little prick at the front desk  your job is customer service  get it together  shit happens and things dont always run smooth but at least take one for the team and apologize 
great room for the price  paid 70 and we were expecting a shitty hotel   rooms looked newly remodeled  beds were comfortable and the place was clean 
we were quoted to have carpet within 3 5 weeks and never denuded up receiving it   after 3 weeks and no one calling to check in we continually called to see the status  we got the run around stating that didnt know how long itd be and then they started avoiding our calls  after the 4th week of us not having our carpet and no update  no returned phone calls  my husband finally went in and demanded a refund   what a waste of time and effort   our biggest complaint isnt that we didnt receive the actual carpet in 2 weeks  but that no one called to check in letting us know it was delayed or an update on when  if we would ever get it   that and the lack of returning our phone calls 
i took my 94 camaro in for a desperate need of a new tint job and it looks great   very friendly and quick service  very affordable as well  thank you so much 
nice  helpful  and very friendly staff at this establishment  the poke bowl is also well deserving of 5 stars  fresh ingredients and all kinds of different combinations of building your burrito or poke bowl  this is place where a poke fanatic must stop by and try  to me it was my favorite from other poke bars in this area 
the quality of the seafood here has dropped  i use to love this place  now its just seem like a typical buffet that is way over priced  its not worth it if you ask me  the only thing that is still good are the crab legs but its no worth pay 60 per person just for some crab legs and some other crappy food  i might give them one more chance if i go to another wsop    d
this is the fourth time that i have visited this location   only because it is the closest  and every time my order is wrong but im charged for what i actually ordered  unfortunately i am already home and starving when i see that my order is wrong otherwise i would go back  i have tried calling to complain but left on hold until i give up    poor staff  poor customer service  i will not be back
i have never experienced such horrible customer service in my life  my first and last time visiting a philly establishment    my friend and i were being simple paying customers  we purchased about 2 3 drinks each  after 2 3 hours  we decided to smoke a cigarette  as we were outside we sat on tables  as soon as we sat down the manager  african american with a beard and glasses   i think his name is kp    came out and said  what the f    are you doing  then screamed at us to get off the table  and i mean screamed at us  i thought he was a random drunk guy trying to fight us at first  he came off very aggressive  under no surcumstance should you make your customers worry about their safety from the co workers  in conclusion i will never return but if the company had better customer service  then i might 
i needed a spare tire for my camper and they had 3 to chose from  didnt want to spend  100s just needed a spare   jose said they had one and bring it in and they would get right to it  went in there the next day dropped the rim off and within 20 minutes ready to go and out the door i went    great service and great prices for people on a tight budget   thanks for the great service
food quality was good  email liters were nice and the wait time wasnt bad even at the middle of lunch hour rush  the only negative is the forgotten items but again they were super busy so it is understandable  we will be back 
my girlfriends and i come here all the time  we love the environment of this little gem and i highly recommend it to anyone visiting vegas  the people are incredibly friendly  ray  zach  brian  tim are all there this year and will surly take care of anything you may need  cant wait to go back for a day of fun in the sun
i cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this place is  the food here is so tasty and they have healthy options or delicious sinful options   the staff are some of the friendliest i have ever met  they take great pride in their family business  oh and have i mentioned their mimosas    yum  between the creativity of their menu  the outstanding personality and service from their staff  and the overall atmosphere or crepe expectations you will certainly not be disappointed  the only thing that may get you down is that there is only one location  and unfortunately for me its no where near my home  but i drive the 30minutes to see the staff  devour some delicious crepes  and bond with my girlfriends over mimosas here  
another fabulous experience with tang   booked our appointments for me and a friend before we leave for vacation and it could not have been easier  im always beyond pleased with the service  level of skills and professionalism this establishment displays  bravo leslie and trang  you guys rock   
great service tonight and yummy food  our server was a really helpful young man who was knowledgeable about the menu and had some great suggestions for our group of 4  the food was fantastic as always and portion sizes are always enough for 2 meals    i love having leftover pf changs for lunch the next day  over all a fabulous girls night out  fun  relaxed  awesome signature cocktails  delicious food  fantastic service  and a cozy environment  we will be back to this location 
great beer selection  plus they do flights if youre indecisive or wanting to try a couple new ones  their happy hour is daily for 3 hours which is pretty awesome on weekends  great spot to watch games  see the golden knights practice  and grab some food  food is good  poutine was not what i expected for  8 but the wingers were great  we had buffalo and thai peanut wings both were great  and the buffalo isnt too hot for me  im a weenie   overall great little spot in a nice new rink service is just a tad slow  if you have the time and youre not in a rush check it out 
we were looking for a good spot for brunch on our way up to chicago and townhall nailed it on the head  great vegan and veggie options  fresh juices and smoothies at incredible prices  compared to brooklyn   and an awesome atmosphere to boot  their acai bowl was everything i needed that sunday morning which we failed to realize was high time for brunch but luckily  we found 2 spaces at the bar inside and were served immediately  well definitely be back next time were in cleveland 
one of my favorite restaurants ive been to on the strip  the cocktails are great and reasonably priced  expect to pay a decent amount for dinner as they are all small plates  make sure to ask to sit outside to get a view of the bellagio water show  the shrimp ravioli was good  as well as the clams  we got the pata negra meat plate as an app
have been receiving bills from this dr for 1 5 years  have gone back and forth with him and insurance and insurance says he is not billing correctly i saw this dr 3 4 times in 2015  he was in network  i received his name directly from a representative at the insurance  coventry one   there was a  40 or  50 copay  i paid that every time i went  after i stopped going i started receiving bills in the mail from the dr  i contacted the insurance  last summer  they said he was not billing correctly that he had never even tried to bill the insurance  i went back and forth between dr and insurance and billing company for months and finally they said it was all straightened out  fast forward to this year and now i am getting bills again  insurance says same thing  dr fired billing company he says  woman who answers his phone hangs up on me and wont do anything 
i celebrated my birthday here on saturday with nine of my friends and i cant say enough great things about this place   service was exceptional and the food was even better   since moving to charlotte ive struggled to find good  simple  fresh food done well in uptown and roosters ended that search    everyone loved the food and all the efforts of the staff who took care of our large party of 10   i dont normally like bbq chicken but i loved it here in addition to the side of mushrooms and mac   cheese   i will certainly be back   thanks roosters for helping make my 31st exceptional 
very impressed so far have been here handful of times and every time the staff is amazing and helpful  easy to find parking and the store is always kept clean and organized  so glad this place has been kept above the standards the other locations around seem to have forgotten about
overall its not a bad place  its typical self serve froyo  i have only tasted their plain and it is good  though it melted super fast  their selection of fruit toppings is limited in quantity and diversity but they have the basics  im not complaining 
this spa is not fancy  but very cozy and convenient if you live in shadyside area  i used to live in the essex house apt building and thats how i know about the place  but now that i live 30 min away  i still come back to this place for the best massage  their staff are extremely knowlegeble and professional  becky is excellent and i love her back  neck   shoulders massage  everytime after the massage i feel totally relaxed  a must try if you havent found a good day spa for massage you love 
my son and his basketball team were playing in a tournament so we were looking for a hotel with things to do for the kids and not being on the strip  this place has a lot to offer  it has 14 movie theaters  bowling alley  arcade and a good size swimming pool  perfect for the kids  the rooms were a surprise  they were clean and bigger then i expected  the bathrooms were very nice  always a plus to have a big bathroom  parking is easy  not like some other hotels on the strip  i was also surprised seeing the casino  it was huge  bigger then i expected too  all the families were happy with the hotel 
weve been to vegas three or four times in the past year and this is the only restaurant weve gone back too every time  we love this place  dim sum is good and theres a good selection to choose from  we laugh every time because our table is full of food before we put our napkins in our lap  we always leave full and happy 
we had to pick up our criss angel tickets at luxor and we were hungry  since we were on that side of town we decided to go check out the m resort and the buffet there  it was a drive to get there  its a beautiful place  the buffet was amazing  so many selections  the food didnt taste like typical buffet food  more like restaurant quality  but dont get fooled  its not fine dining  just the best buffet food weve had 
changing to four stars  i still trust them with my pups and theyre absolutely accommodating  but the last time my two pups visited one came down with a bad case of kennel cough  my dogs are vaccinated  as it is required of all dogs that stay there  and understanding that  kennel cough is easily spread in kennels  animal shelters  etc  its hard to be too upset  but the treatment was totally outrageously expensive  because of this  i still prefer my parents or friends to dog sit when possible  but its nice to know vip is available when theyre not   p
i wanted so much to love this place  we are in desperate need of a great japanese izakaya restaurant   maybe it was a monday but that shouldnt really matter   we ordered two rolls  i didnt even taste the spicy tuna roll  the spicy salmon we had was not fresh   the salmon sashimi wasnt fresh   the uni was ok    ive had better at the cheap rotating sushi places   the tuna poke was pretty fresh and very flavorful  i also had butter fish  dressing on the salad that accompanied this dish was amazing   fish was ok  not great   ramen broth was very tasty  spicy miso  however the noodles werent very good   a little too on the mushy side for my taste   all in all i was expecting a lot more  especially for a restaurant that is having a grand opening   ill be back to give it another shot  but i think ill wait awhile as my stomach isnt too happy with me right now   the waitress was really nice and noticed we didnt eat any of our sushi  so she took off one of the rolls   she really should have taken both rolls and the sushi off if our bill as we didnt even touch them they were so fishy  i hope they freshen up their fish for our next visit
it was really great when it opened but every time weve come since  the flavor and quality has gone down  the crawfish is very salty and the service is very inconsistent  we came in and more then half the restaurant was empty   we went in to get a table first and the host refused to seat us until half the party arrived  even though i told him repeatedly i was ordering for everyone and they were just parking   i understand policy but common sense people   update to my review from earlier this evening   myra a manager came out after reading our review and asked for feedback  i definitely appreciate a business willing to listen to their customers   the servers were also super friendly and helpful tonight as well   i hope theyre able to maintain their consistency and service   we loved it when it opened and we want to love it again  thanks myra 
alright back from our weekend to  theland     we end up going to tomo   ill put it into one word       amazing    we wanted to get there early  i made our reservation at 4 on friday  but didnt have trouble getting into the city or finding an ideal spot to park like we thought   we got to tomo at around 3 15   it was dead in there so they were able to get us a table when we arrived   the place is huge  it has four floors  a dance club  a lounge  two levels of hibachi tables      the hostess told my girlfriend and i  that they usually dont get busy til night time  like 9pm or later  especially on fridays for the club and lounge  so i was surprised by that    the food was incredible   we got asparagus rolls which were fantastic  then the hibachi entrees included sumashi soup  a salad  then the chef came and cooked our meal    the chef was beyond hilarious  he came out singing early 2000s pop songs to us  completely unexpected    made us crack up on more than on occassion   had the food ready in 15 minutes  but you dont even realize it was that quickly because your mesmorized by the show    i got the chicken and my girlfriend got the steak  shrimp entree   they were incredible         i cannot boost this place enough  if you live in the area   please check it out   this place is incredible   the food is literally top 3 places i have ever eaten in my life    we walked away in pain because we ate so much food haha   then follow it up with a dessert of the cavs whooping the hornets  great evening  
ambiance was good   i would not recommend for a romantic date hard to hear one another with music playing but good for a fun spontaneous date   food was okay over prices  paid  20 for 4 pieces of chicken  the greens were disgusting   the veggie sandwich was a little dry i had to remove one bun in order to enjoy it a little more  i asked for sauce but they just had ranch and bbq  dumbs down on that   staff was friendly and the ambiance was relax and nice    i would return but not foe the food maybe for a drink
please do not be fooled by the nurses and admin when you visit this facility  you will think every one is friendly but the minute you leave your loved one behind they are treated like prisoners  my mother was in this facility for 6 weeks and i visited her every day  the cnas are unfriendly and show no compassion  i witnessed one cna yelling at a patient who was sleeping at 12 midnight yelling at her to be quiet and deal with the light  i also witnessed them yelling every morning waking patients up that would startle them  showers are only allowed twice a week  they dont clean pic lines  i witnessed a patients pic line that was filthy and infected  after numerous complaints it was taken out  nurses and cna are here for a pay check not the patients  i also witnessed a patient yelling for help and i asked a nurse to help her and she said   oh she always wants something  i said really  this lady needs to go to the rest room  they only helped because i was standing there  i promise you your loved one will not be happy and if you do decide to leave them please believe what they are telling you  this place is pathetic and i will find every review site on line to inform everyone that this place is about the money not the patients 
happened upon this lovely restaurant recently and i give it two enthusiastic thumbs up  the ambiance was delightful  classy and very quaint  the food was outstanding  we had the crab cakes  pricey but worth every dime   and the lobster rolls and both melted in our mouths  the servers and bartender were super friendly  on the ball and warm  welcoming  perhaps the best kept secret in the valley  go  youll love it  we cant wait to go back 
took about an hour for my food to be delivered  and was pretty cold  the toast was burnt and hash browns were underdone  pretty disappointed because i was starving   
fast service and very pleasant experience  came in to do a cash advance  line was short little to no wait  asked my questions and the rep was very helpful with a pleasant demeanor  would recommend this branch  love the fact that theyre open until 6pm on weekdays 
tried this place for the first time last night and it was amazing  shared an app of 2 dips and chicken tenders and it was delicious  i had a burger which came out perfect  alcoholic drinks were fairly cheap and a good size  definitely will eat here more often  service wasnt overly impressive but also not terrible 
the wait here can be really long   arrive before 11 to get a table right away  theres no room inside for the waiting crowd so if you dont there early enough be prepared to wait outside  in the summer they have 2 patios which are both great   the coffee is tasty and most of the food is really good too but the potato waffles were disappointing  they werent crispy  so while the flavour was good i was disappointed by my poached egg on top of waffle shaped mashed potatoes  however  the smoked salmon sandwich is great  and anything with hollandaise is fantastic  their bacon is crispy and perfect  everything comes with fresh fruit and salad  and the tea selection is wonderful  fairly reasonably priced and the service is efficient if not all that friendly  my vegan  gluten free friends really like this place  and its one of my favourite brunch spots too 
we went here for the amazing sunday brunch   the all you can drink margaritas were surprisingly strong and delicious   the food was also great   fajitas  omelets  fish  carnitas  etc   and they also have yummy desserts to really put you over the top 
we were here last saturday and had a really good time  the steaks were delicious and the service was good  hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it  it was his first time having it  my only complaint was that the music was really loud for a restaurant but hey  we were entertained   we had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak 
my experience at district one was fantastic    first  the food is delicious  not your typical pho spot  has a few creative dishes  you must try the fish tacos and oxtail fries    second  decor and ambiance has a feel good feeling  the music and employees makes it a really fun atmosphere    third  most people wouldnt notice but they have one of the most impressive drink lists ive seen especially coming from a pho spot  i mean every single single malt japanese whiskey you can think of and if youre lucky enough to meet  momma  she might have a shot of fernette with you to cure your hangover    i cant wait to come back to this place 
i would definitely not consider myself a falafel connoisseur by any means  but i do enjoy them as a nice change from time to time    the felafels are great  but dont stand out on their own  it is combination of all the elements  the coriander sauce is delicious  mixed with the hummus and the other great toppings  and to top it off the pita is probably the best ive had  always warm  soft  and never falls apart   the service is always really friendly  and the cherry on top is they give you the top portion of the pita to nibble on while you anxiously await your tasty sandwich   i definitely recommend this place be incorporated into your rotation 
coffee is a must in vegas and this is the place to go  i went in thinking there was going to be no one in there  but it was packed  i ordered a raspberry mocha w   rainbow design on top and my sister ordered the nutella latte  they were both amazing    the raspberry latte was subtle which is exactly how i like flavored coffee  the nutella had just the right about of sweetness   the line was long when we got there  but the guy at the register made sure to apologize once we got to the front  we headed to the counter to get our drinks and they were almost done immediately  i definitely recommend this place 
recently went to vegas and needed a place to have good brunch  i have to say  this place is a must  we got the bottomless mimosas that happen to be real mimosas  aka champagne w   a splash of oj   the carrot cake pancakes which i 100  recommend if you like carrot cake  and i got a made to order omelets  i got a spinach  mushroom  bacon  and light cheese omelette that came with a side of garlic country potatoes and a biscuit  the garlic potatoes tasted like the garlic fries at at t park in sf 
indifferent bartenders  warm beer  slow service and mediocre at best  we were from out of town and did not feel comfortable at all 
ordered orange chicken and kung pao chicken for pick up  the service was quick  which was fabulous  but the food was extremely bland  kung pao had a little kick to it  but was mostly bell peppers as opposed to chicken  orange chicken was like a subpar panda express had made it  not what i expect from an authentic restaurant 
my lease ends in january  cant believe its been a year already  first apartment for my boyfriend and i  great management  quick maintenance  problems resolved with in 24hrs if notice  parking is great  dimensions for rooms are great for a cal king bed  the grass is always nicely cut  trash can overflow but they always take care of everything  we were afraid about the noise from neighbors but it has been great  quiet for the most part  with the exception of one loud neighbor we have   everyone always remembers the bad when writing a review but this place is great    staff is friendly  understanding  and explain everything clearly for you   only complain i have is gate was broken couple times and someone came in and stole my boyfriends motorcycle in the time frame of a week   luckily it was quickly fixed and the bike was recovered  management assured us it would be fixed and everything would be ok  and so it was    rent is going up so we are considering a different location  otherwise great place to live  once again staff is great  this has been a great year living here 
i wish i could give this place 10 stars  i cannot even begin to explain what a wonderful experience it was discovering this place today  i noticed a sign that read olive oil tasting which got me curious  i found this beautifully put together store with an amazing young woman who blew my mind  thank you for making me try something new  i will be back with my family for much more  this place is totally greek approved 
my husband and i was passing through madison for our anniversary getaway  decided have lunch her with a friend  the view here of the capitol and downtown madison was lovely  the food was great  we all had the wisco with side of curds and fries  the curds was yummy weve never had them so couldnt compare to others   but could do w  o the dipping sauce  the tomatoe soup was perfectly creamy  all in all  pretty solid lunch 
i was referred to george brazil from a family member who got a smoking deal on a new trane air conditioner and the install   they were able to match the deal for me and ive had no complaints   they completed the full install  provided me with a reusable air filter  and even replaced some of the duct work in the process   they always call me to schedule an inspection on the system every six months  like clockwork   reliable  honest  and they stand behind their work   thats all i could ask for and id recommend their services to anyone 
dont go during dinner time if youd like to have a conversation with anybody  including the person you came with   it is so blasted loud in this place that we literally couldnt hear the waitress nor each other   and it wasnt just loud talking it was just noise   music  people  tvs  etc   now  were not sticks in the mud by any means  but come on   the food came very fast  which made sense since it wasnt very good   i had the french dip and the meat was very dry  thank goodness for the aus jus   my date had some sort of wrap that didnt even stay together long enough for a single bite  although the taste was good   tequila lime wrap    not interested in returning    food was sub par and the atmosphere is something i remember of a busy dance club when i was 21   have fun 
our first time here was in august  2012  i ordered the ahi dinner  i cant remember what my b  f ordered   let me say the ahi was highly recommended by our waiter   the ahi had zero taste  had poor texture and it was like eating rubber   my boyfriend didnt even finish his dish  when asked how our dinners were  we were both honest only to have the waiter say   sorry to hear that  can i get you the dessert menu    um  no     we always give restaurants at least 2 trys   we went there again new years eve  12  31  12   it was busy  but no wait   they had a new menu of specials and i decided to try the sirloin and lobster tail   it was highly recommended by our waitress as  the best lobster tail shes ever had      she recommended the macadamia crusted mahi mahi to my boyfriend   we ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer     20 minutes later  we still didnt have the fries   25 minutes later  one of the managers comes to tell us hes sorry  but i ordered the last lobster tail in the restaurant and the chef burned it on the grill    note  it was the first time in my life i ordered lobster tail  go figure    he recommended the jumbo prawns instead  which i agreed to   i also asked if we could get our sweet potato fries in 2012   2 minutes later  our fries come   3 minutes later  our entrees come  he says he took the prawns from somebody elses dish so we didnt have to wait any longer      the prawns were so so  my steak was very overcooked  my b  fs mahi mahi was dry and flavorless  and my garlic potatoes were on the verge of cold   at this point  we just wanted to leave so didnt bother sending it all back for bad flavor and temperature    all this being said  the service was good and they were honest with what was going on   our appetizer was comped because it took 30 minutes  and my entree was comped for obvious reasons   no dessert this time either   after 2 tasteless meals  we wont be going back 
i really do enjoy this place  its close to my work and in the middle of downtown phoenix   the staff is very friendly and the service is quite fast   this past visit though didnt leave me as happy as i normally would be   ive ordered their burgers and fries before  which i really enjoyed and especially for the price   today  i opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad   that sounded good to me so that is what i ordered but sadly  all i got were 2 incredibly dinky hot dogs   for  2 75 each  i was not too pleased   even if if had included any toppings  the dog itself was a very small  thin dog   had it been a thin snappy dog   dirty water dog  i could see past it but it wasnt   the potato salad though was very good   i think i will stick to the burgers from now on 
i enjoy this for my delivery place   the food is very yummy and the delivery is on time   lots of choices for delivery and accepts cards and  or cash and you can order online     the blanco could use a bit more of the butter  garlic thing  but it is adequate   i like the pizza okay  and it is definitely better than average  but i would probably put it more at a 3 5 than a 4   however  you can make your own combination and one of these days im going to hit on the perfect combination  but so far  my favorite is pineapple and canadian bacon  dont hate me   the baked ziti is amazing   i also have to rate the appetizers high   for fun when i dont mind going over calories there is fried zuchini and for when i want to be healthy there cut veggies are lovely   the antipasto salad is a winner     the one time i had to complain  forgotten ranch dressing for the fried zuchini  they handled it quite well   so i am a satisfied and returning customer 
very good quality work  they painted my house and did my roof  i highly recommend them  very friendly and professional  and done in a timely manor  the tall guys a pretty nice tall glass of milk if you ask me
oh my god  really good  we ordered the yeti speghetti stuffed pizza and a thin crust pepperoni  both were great   light crispy crust  great sauce  fresh stringy cheese  highly recommend 
we got robbed by pink taco last night   105 dollars for chappy garbage food and tiny margaritas for 2 people   ive had 10 times better food on a street corner in north las vegas for 5 bux   im super pissd   ive never done it before but i even stiffed the chappy as waitres   and i dont feel bad for her one second   i dare you to go into this rip off joint 
just moved to charlotte and was looking for a bar to hang out at  googled this one and decided to make a stop here  drinks was fairly cheap   5 for a blue moon   they also had bar games like pool   5 per person for the whole night   darts  and fooseball  im assuming this is a gay bar or a gay friendly bar  the crowd was regular mid 30s and plus  definetly enjoyed myself   
we had just bought our dream car  but it needed some body work   we did our research and decided to take the car to alps  everything from the quote  to the customer service  to the finished product was phenomenal   we would definitely go there again 
i work very close to this location and have been here many times and have tried almost everything they have on menu  for the price you pay you get really good quality food  i usually get the chimichanga  the fried tortilla is always fresh and the meat is zesty and delicious  the portions are really good and the ingredients are fresh  the food also comes out really quick so much better then like a taco bell or dell taco 
i have been going to this place since it opened and it is nice because they change their flavors often so there is always something new to try   so when i read reviews from hockey retards like cindy b   we know what the b stands for  whining about customer service  well  cindy there are no servers in a self serve establishment  and  the tv  in the establishment cannot be tuned as it is a monitor  and  as far a gluten sensitive i listened to a jewish family whine in a chinese restaurant whine about  gluten for an hour it is your job to do the online research on a restaurant before you get into the car and burn fossil fuel it you have food sensitivities  to write a review like this bashing a cashier not a server is retarded you should read this shit before you submit it   are you for real    no the whole world does not revolve around sports duhhhh  my experience here has always been a friendly one 
one of the best vegan food i have had till now  the place is beautifully done up  the service is great and the staff is really kind  they were very sweet enough to plate our order in 2 different plates as we were sharing the meal  the veggie burger and gracias madre quesadilla was delicious  dont miss the dessert  the blueberry cheesecake is a must have 
bartenders were friendly however they have a food truck called bud buds eats inside  food wasnt good and the food struck staff were very rude 
my fiance and i are not the greatest photo subjects  were awkward  and im not photogenic  the fiance at least looks good   last minute we decided to go with engagement shoots after talking with jonas  we couldnt be any happier with how the photos turned out  jonas is super personable  friendly and helped to put us at ease  were very happy we went with colorroom and are excited to see how our pictures turn out for the wedding 
ive been here many times  so decided to write my first review on this restaurant    this is a restaurant that serves hong kong western style food  this restaurant used to have very nice beef steaks on sizzling plates  a specialty of the hk western style cuisine  in recent years  however  the quality of their steak has dropped and here ill break it down to several areas from my last experience here today   today i came here with my brother  and i ordered an angus sirloin steak on a sizzling plate  70  cooked  medium well   in a red wine mushroom sauce   ambience  the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is a bit bright  akin to hong kong style afternoon tea restaurants  which this one is not   the air does smell appetizing though with the taste of sizzly steaks up in the air  however  this would not be a restaurant for a date  for example  more suitable for the family outing  3  5 stars   service  servers were overall courteous and responded in a decent manner  there was a bit of delay with payment processing but nothing too out of the ordinary   3  5 stars  food  my angus sirloin steak looks very appealing at first  it came with a side of fries  cream soup and bread  the steak itself was really not the best quality  i dont think it can be blamed on the chef but more on the quality of the steak itself  parts of it were too hard to bite through and chew  but most of it was ok  the fries  however  were all soaked in the sauce and not crunchy by the time i got to it  the sizzly hot plate experience is great though for anyone who has not seen it before  they pour the sauce right when the plate is hot so the sauce sizzles in front of you  3  5 stars  price  decent price  reflective of the meal served  might be a bit more expensive than the average hong kong restaurants  but justifiable   overall  this is a restaurant that i would revisit  but only occasionally for the sizzling hot plate experience  if you are looking into decent quality steak  i suggest you go somewhere else  best for family outings  not for dates   overall rating  3  5 stars
ive been to this restaurant many times  and i was originally expecting to give this restaurant at least a 3 star rating  but this experience proves me otherwise   this is a restaurant that was great for ayce sushi  they have a wide variety of selections  ranging from sushi to bbq ribs  i particularly liked their salmon sashimi  the texture is very smooth to chew with just the right amount of softness and they give them in thick slices which is always a plus    today we went for lunch  and i got a sushi and sashimi bento box  it comes along with a garden salad and a mango pudding  the salmon sashimi  as stated above  is great  the mango pudding was actually a nice easy on the stomach little dessert after the huge carbs meal of sushi    but the reason i gave this restaurant an overall rating of 2 stars is because of its sub par service  we went at around 2pm  so some of it might be due to the late lunch timing  but even considering the context  this should not happen at any time  as we were in the middle of our meals  we were asked if they could give us the bill  then they gave us our desserts right away  in addition to that  they turned off the lights above us  so we had to eat in the dark  if you think we might be cutting it late  just close the doors at 1 30  we would understand that    in summary  it is still a good deal for its ayce sushi  just be prepared when you come across service that might ruin the overall experience 
i was planning my 30th birthday for vegas  and it was also my first time there  i wanted to arrive and leave in style while feeling  vip  and to surprise my gfs that were with me  i booked with presidential limos airport roundtrip special with the 6 passenger escalade with brian  he was super awesome at everything  kept in contact with me when we landed to let me know where he was   helped with our bags  and even gave us mini cold water bottles at arrival  on the way to the hotel  he gave us recommendations for restaurants and places to go  thanks for the recommendation to go to scarpetta  soooo good     brian was so amazing  that i put in a request for him to pick us up for our trip back to the airport  overall  i would use this company again  so worth spending a little more on great  prompt  and helpful service  thanks for being a part of my 30th
this place is very nostalgic for me  my first job in phoenix 25 years ago when this place was the phoenix fishmarket  the bluewater grill is based in southern california and im quite familiar with their location in newport beach  we usually are seated at the sushi bar or oyster bar  the sushi bar serves one of my favorites hamachi kama  yellowtail collar  some of my other favorites are the fried oysters the prawns with pasta and garlic and the sushi selection is quite good 
i live in aliante so to get to sparks family medicine is about a 30 minute drive  but it is well worth it the nurses and other staff are professional courteous  and make you feel welcome  dr darryl fortson was great hes knowledgable funny and makes you feel at ease  i think i found a new doctor for my family  thank you sparks family medicine 
our server alodia provided great service  food is fresh well marinated  great atmosphere for whatever get together 
big tasty servings    really quick and kind staff  specifically breeannda    super clean    everything i want in a dinning experience 
i purchased a full kitchen suite from spencers  on scottsdale road  july 2010     first  my sales person  paul  swore he would help me with the rebates that were available both with whirlpool and the state at the time   he said he submitted and when i called to confirm  both rebates were ineligible because everything wasnt submitted in time   i lost out on nearly  500 in rebates because of paul   second  on september 10  2010  my refrigerator stopped working   turns out the fridge stopped defrosting itself and the board had to be replaced   spencers sent someone out and it was repaired   september 9  2011  the same thing happened again   this time spencers refused to help because it was 6 weeks out of warranty  even though this is a continuing issue   i used my home warranty and a repair person came out  confirmed the same issue  computer board needs to be replaced for a second time  and stated this is a rarity and that i got a faulty fridge   paul has done nothing but provide lip service   he says he contacted the whirpool rep and that whirlpool would make this right   i have heard nothing from paul or whirlpool   i understand that sometimes you just get a lemon   what i dont understand is why spencers doesnt stand behind the products they sell   especially such new appliances   they care nothing about you   they will say whatever they need to in order to get you to purchase and out the door   their prices might be good but you will get nothing else with that   there is zero service here  
this forever 21 was my favorite store inside fashion show mall and my favorite forever 21 ive ever been to out of the ones ive visited in new york and houston  its two floors and the selection is awesome  i was able to find two sweaters pretty quickly that i loved  i came on a monday in the afternoon and the store was pretty empty  im giving this forever 21 five stars because at all the forever 21s ive been to the sales associates dont offer any customer service unless you are waiting for a dressing room or checking out  two sales associates here offered me a bag to carry my stuff and just asked how i was doing in general  i worked at old navy in retail for half a year so i subconsciously pay attention to these things  everything was also very organized and neat and i was able to find what i wanted quickly despite the store being giant 
this was one of the coolest things i saw on my trip to vegas and it was free  i came during the nighttime and it was so colorful  beautiful  and magical  my sister went during the day  and said it looked different at night so i would try to see it  both during the day and night if possible  it also changes with the seasons so if im ever in vegas again  ill definitely be returning 
i ordered the nutella milkshake  kobe beef burger on an onion bun with bacon  cheddar  and truffle mayo  and our table split the fried macaroni and cheese  fried zucchini  and onion rings  i dont know if i ordered wrong but my beef didnt have a lot of flavor  the fried macaroni and cheese was my favorite  the nutella milkshake was pretty yummy as well  for the price and since there are so many other delicious dining options in vegas  i would not recommend the burger bar  our waiter however was very attentive and split our bill for us to include the shared fried foods we ordered which was pretty awesome 
good food  but worst service ever  they stole 10  from me  never come back here again
i knew amy because she had attended a small business workshop i facilitated  i was excited to hear she was coming to my neighborhood  i am a bit of a workout snob  i dont like any studio that is too serious or a gym that is more stretching then working out    crossfit upper limit was a perfect balance of a great workout  friendly and not intimidating  neither my husband or i had ever done crossfit before  amy and her team made it easy to jump in and gave clear simple instructions  with great supportive feedback  they also have an easy to manage schedule and no complicated membership fees    i look forward to attending this gym on the regular 
incredibly delicious everything  i ate breakfast here the past two days and lunch  all 4 masks were ridiculously good  this place is inexpensive and the ingredients are high quality  everyone is super nice and they even donate to charity for every meal  i hope they keep expanding  
heard about nobu many times  obviously  but first try was on valentines day  the hotel couldnt get us checked in so we had to go in t shirts and shorts but the hostess didnt give us any grief when we explained our predicament   pros  food was very high quality and the service was very fast  thats about it   cons  there were no frills  it was almost boring  decor was nice  but it was just kind of boring  mostly because the service was too fast  that may sound strange but they were at the table every 2 minutes with another dish or to ask us to order more  it just seemed very rushed  we tried to take our time and talk but we were done with our dinner in under an hour  that was the pace they set  which is great for turning tables but it wasnt the most pleasant experience  the cost of many of the dishes were insanely over priced   i would go here again  if someone else was paying  haha   but wouldnt make it a romantic evening  food was pretty great 
beautiful restaurant with great food  high end sushi place   pros  food is always fresh and delicious  ive been here 4 times and never had a single bad plate  they have several rolls with mango  kiwi and i think another fruit and theyre all incredible  really inventive and original rolls that are just fantastic  plum wine was delicious and strong  service has always been good and professional  never had to wait more than 5 minutes  even at peak times  restaurant always clean  with fancy touches   cons  definitely a high end sushi place  kind of pricey but worth it  no all you can eat option  no happy hour that i know of  only open for dinner   will definitely be eating here again in the future 
the best parts about this place are the beginning and the end   the cheeses are all fantastic and interesting   the dessert is absolutely incredible and really the highlight of the meal   dont fill up on overcooked mediocre meats  save room for the insane chocolate covered everything   overpriced for having to cook mediocre meats on your own and not knowing how to cook in broth without a timer and so many pokers in the pot   but  its a fun experience   i will not go for dinner again  entrees are just so so and insanely pricey for what you get  but i will go just for dessert some night  it is that good   i would only give 3 stars if the chocolate fondue wasnt so amazing 
we were visiting phoenix and had an itch to stimulate our brains  all escape rooms were booked up way in advance and there was no same day rooms available in the entire city  i called sleuth and they convinced one employee to come in early and let us in  it was super great of them and we were appreciative   pros  very difficult and fun room  tons of locks and puzzles to solve  location was pretty easy to find  typical warehouse  office park setting   cons  there is no background story at all  not even a theme or premise given to us  just go in and unlock some locks  i mean  yes that is the basic protocol but with no story at all it just lacked some planning elements  the staff member gave us a really big hint before even going in  repeating it 3 times  so when it came time for that clue  it wasnt exactly difficult  also when we would get stuck on something after just a couple minutes  he would chime in with a hint  im all for having a little help but i dont want my thoughts to be interrupted every few minutes and take my mind off the game   overall  really difficult  fun room  poor job of preparation with having no background story but we would go again if they get more rooms  they only have 1 room 
first time here andthe food was good but the cashier and bartender were extremely rude hence the reason for the low rating 
just had my 1983 cadillac coupe deville repaired here  went to about 3 other places got a better deal here with ac delco parts  ive been to other places who charge ore but use autozone or oreilly parts and yes they do have a lifetime warranty but who wants to keep paying for labor over and over  i figured my tie rods and sway bar bushings went out after 32 years why not put on the same factory parts  thank you chris and bart 
perfect example of how you should not run a business  ordered a large iced americano on 2 occasions  prices were trickling into the  5 00 range  my total was  4 27 found the  27 cents and offered to get  1 00 back cashier stated its done already  sticking with my regular place going forward
huge beer selection   everything cooked with beer   nice variety of high end bar food   infusion of ethnic flavors  caribbean and indian especially   laid back  i enjoyed it 
i really like some of the providers but the office is very busy and the staff is not the nicest  the office is on the second floor which is a bit of a pain  and it could use some updating  the only reason i havent switched is because i love the nurse practitioner 
this place is gem  a little ways from the las vegas strip  but worth the short drive  we opted for the hibachi grill  the food was excellent  our chef  will  made the entire experience even more enjoyable and humorous  not going over the top and corny like other teppan chefs  i definitely recommend this place and will return the next time were in the las vegas area 
a few months ago we had these fellas work on the brakes for our nissan  they fixed us right up  monday on the way home from work  my husband broke down in the same car  he decided to call this location even though it was far from where the car broke down because they were good to us   are close to home  the fellas here went above and beyond to help us this time  not only did they find a tow truck to go and pick up our car but they had it fixed in less than 24 hours  thank you to everyone there for getting us back on the road  again    i would give you 10 stars if i could    especially jonas     amazing costumer service   quality repairs                    sincerely  christal   wendel
amazing   i was very skeptical in trying this but i order the brisket sandwhich and the marinated korean beef covered fries with the green tea with mango fruit  omg  best meal ive had in years  the drink was sooo good too  pretty good with the little jel balls and fruit  will be ordering again soon 
sunday early am  after dropping family at the airport looking for a breakfast place that is open so early  6 30    i have been waiting to try bear diner  we were greeted warmly by our server beatriz  this time of day pick your own table    server pointed out the big griz breakfast special      tons of food  wish she had pointed out the lighter portions available  biscuits are huge and fluffy  all in all it was a great visit  will come back for lunch or dinner 
awesome bar  had the 10 and the 15 year pappy van winkle  awesome selection  the location is great  and the people are very friendly  great place to watch football 
best combination rice ever   i always order it when i eat here and thats what keeps me coming back
placeholder review  did our wedding cake  it was absolutely amazing and they did it on short notice without extra cost  thank you 
prestis has pretty good food and great prices   if you want to grab a quick cheap lunch  look no further   the food is good quality  ive been here 20  times and never felt bad   thats pretty good for a place where you can get lunch for  5   the staff is ok  theres one older lady who messes up drink orders sometimes  but they always fix it in the end   the sweets are delicious too   if you want a fun community and good food at a great price  come to prestis 
great service from lee mcclennin our serverlast evening   drinks and food are just okay 
not a place i would put near the top of my list  but good enough   went for nye 2015 as well as august 2014   my dates  friends and i ordered steaks and cocktails each time without disappointment   outback steakhouse is my barometer for measuring all steakhouses  and while firebirds steaks arent much better than outbacks their ambience and decor is very warm  cozy and intimate     im not big on cocktails  but i can say that the martini with vodka was average 
one of my favorite takeout spots in charlotte   the chicken is always moist  the sauces are good  and the rice with vegetables is light and refreshing 
terrible cutomer service     i tried suggesting to put up sign with the information of the towing company that this place has a contract with because there isnt any around the units in the back and plenty of residents around have complain about it         patrick said that hes british and he just know better to not park in the red fire line   and that there is a reason why the garage has space for two cars     i told him i had my other two cars park in there and i was only getting my groceries out and he proceeded to say       how is that his fault     great answer    they have a contract with a towing company that is 15 miles away from the property and the towing company charges for miles so i ended up paying an extra 100  because the towing place is 15 miles away      so rude not need to be yelling at me because he cant control his temper because you know americans are so stupid and british are so much better    
love it   coming from az  we are so picky  when it comes to mexican cuisine   weve  found that the salsa is always an indicator of what is to come and theirs was perfect in texture  flavor  and zip   that said  their lunch entrees were great and well be anxious to return 
on a cold day in edinburgh  nothing sounds much better than some warm comfort food  i stopped in around 1 30pm and was immediately greeted and shown to a table  i went with two of the sausage of the day selections  pork and leek  beef with onions and garlic  and the cheese and onion mash  for the gravy  i asked for a recommendation between the traditional brown and the caramelized onion   without hesitation  the server recommended the caramelized onion   every time   she said  so  i went with that    everything was outstanding   the flavors in the sausages and mash were so good that i hardly needed the gravy  though it was delicious  too   service could not have been friendlier    if youre looking for some traditional british fare  this is a great place to stop 
my husband and i came here to eat before seeing a movie  he always wants to go eat at a deli place and i usually turn him down because i am not a big sandwich person  normally deli places dont have very much selection and i can be very picky  however  i remembered dillys deli is a place that i loved  they have bread bowl with broccoli and cheese soup or clam chowder  yum  i suggested it to my husband and he was so excited  we ate there and of course i ordered a bread bowl and salad  my husband ordered a sandwich and a bread bowl  he loved it  now we have a place to go to when y husband is craving a sandwich  i gave dillys 4 stars only because the floor looked kind of dirty and it needs some decorations  it is pretty depressing in there  but the food is great 
ive been to their other location a handful of times and love it every time i go there  but since i was closer to this location  i decided to give it a try   the food is the same  its always just as delicious  but the reason for this two stars was the service  the waitress made it such a bad experience    she had an attitude the whole time  from the minute we stepped in  she wasnt even welcoming  she had zero patience for us when we were deciding on chicken or beef  a 30 second discussion   she only refilled our waters once while there were only two other tables here  not even a smile from this lady   i love komex and i will continue to go  but definitely not this location 
i saw this post blow up on twitter  and made plans with my cousin to come here  im not very make up savvy  but im glad they have lots of options from low end to kind of high end make up brands    to start off with  i enjoyed the aesthetic of the place  so many lights  and so clean  i know that its new  so its obviously going to be clean  but with as much foot traffic that comes through the door  the definitely keep everything nice and organized  and they also have a place to take selfies  haha  the workers were all super friendly and really helpful  i bought 5 lip pencils 2 not pictured   2 la girl concealers  2 eyelashes and 1 sharpener  all for 17 dollars  such a great deal 
terrible cs  will never go back  beware of terrible service  bad attitude  would not honor reis return policy   i will take my business to a store that treats me right  they make you think you are part of the co op by buying in  what a joke   i have been a member for over a decade and they have lost a loyal customer 
came here for breakfast and felt torn   should i order a savory breakfast or go balls out and go for a dessert crepe  i made the terrible mistake of settling for somewhere in between   i got  sweet brunch item   i settled on the chocolate cheesecae crepes   10 95   bad move   i thought it would be more cheesecake y  it was mostly banana with chocolate syrup in a crepe  i didnt even like the sauce it came with that much  but i did really like the raspberry with whipped cream  honestly  i wish i had just said    hey  its vegas  youre at max brenner  who cares what time it is   and gone with something ridiculously sweet with ice cream or something  oh well   you live and you learn  now i know for next time   boyfriend got the candes killer breakfast skillet   14 95   which he really liked  scrambled eggs  sausage  onion  tomatoes  spinach  fries and mushrooms in a skillet with a a baguette and some choclolate to dip it in  i thought it was good  but wasnt blown away  would have preferred it with a bit of ketchup  i also got a cafe latte  which was wonderfully foamy and  of course  had two pieces of chocolate which melted their way into the cup  i could have done without the chocolate  but it didnt influence the taste much  i enjoyed it because it helped cut the sweetness of the crepes really well   i will definitely be back  but for  next time    i know now how to approach max brenner  dont be shy  go for the sweet stuff 
have ordered take out a few times at this location since its close to work   the person taking the orders have always been nice   the specials they have on certain days fridays  are great   i got 2 medium special pizzas for under  20  really good crust   pacific veggie  7 cheese  and surpreme are just yummy   something about the crust that makes me keep going back 
few yelpers and i went to happy hour at phoenix public market cafe  the soft pretzels and cheese plate was really good  they only make a certain amount so you may not be able to get it on some days  all of us ordered the pork chili pot pie for dinner   i got my pot pie first  and ended up only having two pieces of pork in the pie   my pie consist mostly of onions and sauce  hardly any meat   it was really spicy and needed a small topping of lettuce  tomatoes and maybe guac to cut the heat   our waiter asked how we liked it  and i mentioned that mine hardly had any meat in it   he said  you must of gotten the last bunch before they started making more    um thats not a good excuse especially if im paying  9 50 for it plus drinks   i like the fact they start happy hour at 3 pm till close plus they are open early for breakfast     its a good place to try downtown and its owned by the same individual as st  francis   it seems to attract an older crowd and families with young kids 
hungry at lunchtime  india palace has a great indian buffet for around  10 pending on your beverage   since its a buffet  you can enjoy eating rather than waiting to be served   staff has always been friendly   besides the buffet  you do get a basket full of naan bread   its a huge restaurant so bring your all your hungry co workers   tandoori chicken is spicy and tender   i do like the potato and cabbage dish  rice and the spinach saag   some of the reviews say its not totally authentic  well it pleases my palate therefore i will be back 
if youre a senior and want a decent and good tasting meal for about  7 77  try this one  stop at bk and get a side salad with croutons and apple cider dressing  great    and a fresh cup of good coffee  starbucks coffee without being burned     take it to this  or any  subway  winchells and order the ham  chedder  and egg breakfast sandwich on a plain croissant from winchells  plenty of mayo  and have em warm it up after its made    then get a cup of broccoli cheese soup from subway   drinks at both places are too pricey  and bks coffee is far superior to winchells  subway uses same coffee but cuts it off at 11am and charges more than bk   so if you want a drink other than coffee  get a senior drink at bk and bring it along too   now thats a well rounded and yummy meal   boulder city just got our own sub  win here last week   now if somebody at subway only knew the wifi password 
love that theres a new pho spot in oakville  pho was delicious  servers were friendly   the place is clean and nicely decorated  will be back  
very polite and experience driver like there is a guy chris who is one of most intelligent people i ever met whos been picking me up for months but recently they hired a guy name jack who is hilarious and a real nice person and so when it comes to transportation i recommend v  m  t over any other taxi company like veo and discount where vehicle smells and drivers are rude
the service is good but a bit pricey   got charged  270 for fixing the dishwasher in 30 min   
katie is amazing  katie asks questions about your life  work and fitness regimens  she sets realistic goals and a plan that accommodates your lifestyle  custom plan based on your needs   goals  if you want tacos she makes it work  i recommend her highly    she helps with recipes  snack ideas and so much more  
a cut above the sleazy downtown hotels  but they close the pool at 7 pm  never had that happen at a marriott  room is mediocre  if the convention was not here i would not stay here and next time i will walk from another hotel   inside restaurants are mediocre that we have tried   staff generally is foreign and does not speak english that we can determine    find another place to stay  there are many other better options 
terrible place  the masseur was rude and done a terrible job  whats worse  they made you to add 40  tip and said thats the  rule   never seen a massage place like this before  at first i left 20  tips and the guy came out and grabbed my money and said  shame on you   omg  i was speechless and just told my wife to get out from there asap   my friends who lived in vegas said no locals come here for massage and they try to gain business by ripping off the tourists  especially those who doesnt know how to speak english  they would try to convince you to write good reviews by giving you a discount 
these people are awesome  they are very responsive and helpful   i have been using them for 3 years and am extremely pleased with their customer service and quick responses 
friendly  fast service  my car hadnt been cleaned in a very long time  i dont have pets  children so it wasnt disgusting but a lot of dirt  grime  coffee spills  had the express detailing done  car looked great and done in less than 45 min  well worth the money and i will return again 
my husband and i really like the pizza here  it is delicious and not greasy like some pizza chains can be  they always make an effort to remember you if youve been in before and many times it will be one of the owners themselves handing you your pizza  they will soon be moving across the parking lot to a larger space which is nice because they didnt have much seating previously  although we usually take our pizza home so it didnt make too much of a difference to us 
thanks to shawn and josh for a great job they have made a great change to this place  bklyn steve
ive only seen dr kermani couple of times    i have not seen dr kermani almost 2yrs now but all of sudden i get a phone call from my pharmacy that my prescriptions ready   was told dr kermanis office sent it    it was not easy to get hold of someone from dr  kermanis office to find out what the prescription is all about but finally got hold of someone but she acted like it was no big deal that i almost filled medication that was sent by mistake  im glad i stopped going there not only staff could careless that i almost filled the medication not meant for me  but such an incompetency is scary
ordered fish tacos  recommended by waiter    got three tacos with crispy crust  and very little actual fish inside  neither waiter seemed concerned about my complaint  wont go back
this is by far my favorite teriyaki place especially the beef plate   the chicken is pretty good to they previously had a cashier that never smiled which is real let down and prevented me from going there more  cause it made me feel bad  but i think she is gone cause i havent seen her in awhile the new one is smiling and make you feel a lot more welcomed if you like teriyaki places this is the one you have to try the beef is char grilled so it gives the extra flavor by the far the best in town  blows teriyaki madness imo 
nice selection of premium dog foods and treats  yes  its expensive   good customer service    i bought a bag of  75 dog food that was the same brand i usually buy but in a new flavor  unfortunately  that flavor made my dogs sick  4 paws took back my open bag of dog food and gave me a  50 credit to buy a new bag 
this is a dive bar  expect that  and youll have fun    i prefer woodshed i  however both are delightfully tacky yet unrefined  take that hooters  this place is the real deal that you try to mimic 
any time of day  as long as theyre open  this is a great choice  coffees to sandwiches  salads to wine   pizzas    simple and convenient menu  watch out for their summer hours    if they were open before 8 am id give 5 stars 
on behalf of the beer  wine  liquor area  its very handy and priced well  check out the photos i posted of the growler section  selection  prices  whole foods market had the best price on jugs   4  but this gas station is closer to home   therefore convenient for a fill every now and then  nice staff  i will be back    must admit  when just i need fuel i use the qt right across the street instead 
this was my bday dinner  me and two others  we had a cocktail in bar bartender was great met owner very nice guy  early around 5  had brussel sprouts as app  fantastic  pasta figule soup not sure of spelling  was ok  not my idea of the soup but was good  stroganoff as dinner fabulous  chicken  biscuit and a burger and fries dessert was a cherry crisp  a real nice experience and will be back     the price so affordable for great fresh different food 
pomelo and lucis at the orchard is an absolutely beautiful space  we went for dinner on a saturday night and had a terrific experience  great service and the food was amazing  we will be back 
i organized a corporate dinner event for 50 employees  i had not been to richardsons before  but had heard great reviews and was excited to host our event at this special space  i walked into the restaurant and was greeted with rude service from the start  a waitress actually yelled out behind me  move   it appears that the staff was overwhelmed and acted as though they did not know the specifics of our reservation  which we had gone over with the events person in detail weeks prior  after speaking with the manager  the service did improve and i have to say the food was fantastic  it is a beautiful  special space and they serve amazing food  but the service was not good 
i heard such great reviews of this place so i thought id give it a shot   i had the evenings special which was a basa fillet with rice and veggies  my husband had an item off of the menu which was the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes   we also both had french onion soups to start   the soup was okay  ive had better at other places  i found it too salty   i wasnt sure what kind of cheese they used but the cheese kinda fell flat with this   the basa fillet dish was nicely cooked  albeit bland   the rice side was essentially steamed rice with bits of broccoli   my husbands ribs were phenomenal  the meat was perfectly tender that it came off the bone clean   the sauce was great   the mashed potatoes were so so  couldve been done better   what was great were the desserts  my husband had the tutti frutti crepe which was an ice cream  cant recall the flavour  with mixed fruits  meanwhile i had the apricot crepe  oh my god  this was soooo delicious   the crepe was filled with apricot mousse  with an apricot ginger ice cream on the side  as well as apricot chutney    i think i will come back to this restaurant mainly for the desserts  im craving for another round of crepes tonight   
awesome air conditioning repair company   quick  efficient  on time   even in 110 degree heat   will call again 
there are so many great places to eat in scottsdale and this is not one of them   the staff was awkward and the food was very bland   not what we were expecting from a place with  culinary  in the name 
my daughter ordered 72 flowers  6 vases  for my 70th birthday   they were delivered on time  and are magnificent 
the very good prime rib sushi and poke salmon and veg crab cheese cake pecan pie service  the berry bad brisket veggie sushi seaweed ocean salad  overall not bad for the price   37 for dinner weekdays  id come back again 
the food that comes out of this place is delicious   first time here and impressed will be back 
ive been receiving botox injections for years  and until now 20 units would last approximately 4  months   they were running a special in december that was 30  less then what i was paying  so i jumped on the opportunity to save a little money   the saying  you get what you pay for  definitely applies to the botox that was used on me  as the effects lasted a mere 8 weeks   when i asked my plastic surgeon why this happened  he said the vial that was used was probably diluted   i would not recommend perfect skin laser center 
praising arizona   i am a small business owner in san francisco who needed to print some custom signs for our outdoor display  i really wanted to stay local with my business  but after getting either prohibitively expensive quotes or crappy attitudes from the vendors i called  i decided to scour the internet   and discovered a gem all the way in tempe    they offered competitive pricing  and was thorough from beginning to end   asking me to double check the measurements and features on the display hardware so that i would end up with the product that i needed    in the end  we discovered that i had ordered the wrong products  and next level signs worked quickly to rectify the situation  the result  the best looking signs ive had to date    they even saw to it to give me a  good mood  discount  it wasnt much  which was fine because their pricing is highly competitive  but the fact that i got one made my day    as im learning in my own business   nothing   not good quality  pricing  branding  a fancy website or location matters like great human to human interaction  aka customer service  these folks are doing it right  i highly recommend them for all your signage needs   thanks  stacy and the crew at next level signs 
first visit here and i can not find any faults   the place is nicely decorated and in great shape   i only say this because so many chinese restaurants i go to look like they never repair or update their furnishungs   the menu has all the popular items but is not overly huge   we ordered egg drop and wonton soups and then  mongolian beef and curry chicken   everything was served in a timely manner  looked great and tasted even better   very happy we decided to drive a little farther for this experience   i think too many times we settle for what is convenient instead searching for better
i would say no stars   they advertised on craigs list a playcraft 8 x 16 utility trailer for 1599 00   the pictures in the ad showed the trailer had a ramp or gate   when i got there  they told me that the ad was a mistake  the trailer advertised did not come with a gate   totally misleading ad   they would not honor the price they advertised   i checked to see if the ad was still up on craigslist and it is   epic fail    i will not buy anything from these guys  they are not running an honest business   funny thing too  at the bottom of their ads  they quote a bible verse  john 3 16   dont think i was handled in a christian like manner at all 
just saw jimmy hopper in the tropicana lounge in las vegas and was blown away    jimmy hopper is amazing    thank you tropicana for having such amazing talent in your hotel    
great clinic with amazing medical providers and staff   you cant find clinicians anywhere else that care about their patients from the bottom of their hearts like they do at amc   the patient population is very diverse at this clinic  so they usually have staff who can speak spanish  burmese  nepalese etc   if they dont have staff who can speak your language  they will provide you with an interpreter through the language line     there is a tv in the main waiting room and in each exam room that show family friendly movies   pretty awesome   perfect clinic for your primary care 
i heard so many good things about chick fil a  so i had high expectations   i got a grilled chicken sandwich and it was soggy and flavorless    the food was disappointing  but the staff were nice and the tables were clean 
i have to say i was pretty disappointed given the number of reviews for this place   my wife had the veal chop and i had the lamb chops   we also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach   i cant say it was anything special and ive definitely had better on all fronts   my main issue is that im a big fan of lamb but the citrus sauce that they used pretty much killed all the gamey flavor   i guess thats fine for people who dont want a gamey taste but then they probably shouldnt be ordering lamb anyways   for the price  i would definitely recommend going elsewhere 
i used bullwark for years and never had any issues with pest control  so i made the big mistake to move to ecoshield  i was told by ecoshield that there would be some initial bugs issues but it has just got worst over time so now i cancelled with ecoshield  they then made me pay for their promotion first service   250  which i really did not need and i have been paying every month for service that they promised and did not deliver   bad joice  back to bullwark i go
i absolutely loved this place   the food is absolutely divine and the addition of the chimmi churri sauces made everything better  my friend and i both ordered the parilloda mixta which consists of the chicken  chorizo  and ny strip  we also ordered a small plate of grilled shrimp  yellow rice and roasted potatoes  my steak was well done and the chicken with the green chimmi sauce made it more flavorful  the sausage was a little salty for me but the next day i finished the rest and weirdly it was perfect  i wish we wouldve remembered to bring a bottle of wine since its byob  there was not as much seating as i would have liked upstairs but we managed to snag a table as a couple got up to leave  the menu was a little confusing at first but i just hopped on yelp and the pictures on here helped us out tremendously  we were both extremely satisfied and we will definitely return  our meals were worth every penny 
new food spot in town  visiting my pittsburgh friend and my friend ashley introduced us to this place  apparently this place is owned by the same people who own sidelines  thee best wing place in pgh hands down   so we absolutely love sidelines and wanted to try this new place  the menu changes and right now they are still trying new things out  my black and yellow burger was great  grass fed beef  always a plus  smoked gouda apple bacon  onions on a brioche roll  best rolls for burgers in my opinion   i didnt care for the fries too much  and i had a drink i dont remember what it was  maybe  we should be best friends   my friends had a breakfast burger  wings  the arancini  risotto siraccha balls  were really good too  my friends had the makers mark   ginger ale drinks and i took a sip very weak as far as makers mark taste  id come back to this place  id be interested to see how the menu changes 
second time here this time for brunch  i was really excited to try the chicken and funnel cake  i dont know what i was thinking  of course the funnel cake was super greasy  the chicken was fried a little to hard for my liking  lacked flavor and was really bland  the home fries were flavorless as well and the salt n pepper i added didnt seem to make it better  i was really disappointed  my friends said their food was ok  i ate the chicken but literally had to take the breading off cause it was so crispy and add syrup to make it taste like something  so basically i had syrupy chicken  i would not go for brunch again  i would just order off their regular menu 
looks good great atmosphere   great service  however our food was enough to where we were not hungry which is normally perfect for me  i dont like waste and oversized portions  i had the steak cauliflower it was decent flavor and i kept my calorie count in check but seriously there was nothing but mashed up gooey looking tomatoes served with it  no sides whatsoever to compliment the dish  the spice chicken my husband had was flavorful but he ate every morsel and also had nothing but tomatoes on the side which he does not like and didnt know they were part of the dish  so basically we are saying we felt like suckers for choosing searsucker    wine list and prices not fair definitely overpriced and im not referring to overpriced as expected 
i have been a twc customer for 18 years  they took money from my checking account which they were not authorized to do and refused to replace it and the fees they caused in my acct  i will be switching isp  this company is a joke  after 18 years they treat me horribly  i will be telling everyone i know  they lied to me for two weeks telling me they would refund my money  today they come up with some bull shit as to why they did not refund my money  they have terrible service and even worse customer service  i will shut my internet dow before o deal with time warners crap
this place is a great little ramen shop tucked away in chinatown near a marine riders bar    the ramen has a great smooth and creamy flavor that is awesome  going to definitely be coming back again soon 
myself and a coworker went in on 8  28  17 at approx 12 30pm for a quick lunch  we requested 2 of the  6 meals which included 2 chili cheese dogs  1 fry  1 drink  and 1 sundae  after we ordered  the guy working said  our deep fryer is down  and he charged us  5 38  he then told us that their ice machine is broken so he couldnt give us our drinks  this all happened after we already payed  so basically we payed almost  6 for 2 shitty chili cheese dogs 
it was our last stop before heading home in vegas  someone in our group was craving shrimp  so i did what anyone would do   i opened the yelp app lol i found this place to be less than 10 minutes from the strip with a rating above 4 5 so we decided to give it a try  we had trouble finding it but its located in the shopping center behind autozone  tucked away in the corner  a real small hole in the wall type of restaurant   we were greeted and served immediately upon coming in  the menu had something for everyone  including non seafood eaters  the prices were not cheap  but its vegas  back home  at 18 bucks a place youre at a decent sit down restaurant   definitely not a hole in the wall    now the meal  absolutely delicious  we ordered the camarones aguachiles as an appetizer and they were spot on  i crave them just thinking about them  the molcajete was great  the pescado sarandeado was good  and the shrimp cocktail was delicious also  basically  you cant go wrong ordering anything off the menu    oh  and the horchata and jamaica drinks are home made    we will be coming back on every vegas visit for sure 
i was calling around trying to get a pink champagne cake for my boss birthday  i am so happy i found barbs bakery as they were able to make the cake and put a special note on top  although i ordered 4 days in advance  there were other bakeries that could not make my order in time  i picked it up on my way to work and the employee who helped me was very friendly  we were all blown away by how delicate and beautiful the cake was and it tasted even better than it looked  i would highly recommend this bakery to others and i will definitely be using them again in the future 
unfortunately  all previous positive experiences at oggies was canceled out on this visit   weve come to expect good food and beers at reasonable prices in a fun environment  while the food  pizza  and beer were still tasty  the prices and service failed to meet standards   the service issues stemmed from a couple large parties which were apparently not expected  i doubt this will be an ongoing problem   the pricing policy however will be the reason i wont be returning for some time  a  happy hour  medium pizza and 4 house beers for  50 is unreasonable and not close to area prices  the policy of 25  off  pizza or happy hour beer prices isnt made obvious nor is it competitive   sorry that i cant  recommend this restaurant again 
i would give this store zero stars if it was an option  my experience with them was shipping something to a family members and they were charging a  ups gas surcharge  there is no such thing as a  ups gas surcharge  so that money the store is pocketing and i contacted ups about this matter  they explained that there is no such thing and it is hard for ups to regulate what the stores do  i will never return to this store and i live less than a mile away  i go to the one off of davis lakes and they are fantastic  
its a great casual golf experience  the customer service is horrible  we waited for our food for over an hour  when we finally got our food my husbands chicken wings were still bleeding  i explained this issue to the manager and she convinced me that the wings sometime just have  veins  that bleed  not satisfied at all  eat before you come would be by suggestion  its not the money for the horrible food 
i absolutely love this place  you cant beat the friendly service and the sunday champagne brunch is phenomenal  its great to always see the owner  manager working behind the bar and out on the restaurant floor greeting customers 
tiffany was so nice and professional  she did a great job on my nails and pedi  i really loved that the way they wax didnt hurt like other shops ive been to   i dont know what product it is but for that reason alone i will return  this is def my new place  
i love this little salon  they actually take time to ask how i am and carry a converation while doing this amazing work  they do great even when im rushing to make it back to work  everytime im over here i make sure to drop by for my fills and pedi 
i have been to many buffalo wild wings in multiple states  i have also been to this bdubs in particular  i am a fan of this buffalo wild wings  the service is spot on  the employees are great and its a very clean place 
awesome honey toast  the milo with black jelly taste soo good at this hot season of vegas its deff awesome to have it and try  
food is average  the server i got sucks as heck  he seems mad or having a bad day but greeting someone shouldnt even giving a tone like that    and i dont think he knows food handler safety also how he handle giving me the food i ordered      worst part is i ordered an ice coffee took about the same time other side that came last got theirs first    sorry i do time whatever i get   if i wouldve the other guy as a server i wouldnt be like this but oh well probly im not coming back at all   
i heard the mac   cheese here was exceptional so i came here with high expectations  the mac   cheese with the ham was  20 in total  however i regret adding  2 for the ham  i saw a review on yelp that warned me of the ham  but alas  was too foolish not to listen  since the waitress said it gives the dish a  wholistic  feel  personally i thought the ham was way too salty and obstructive since it was piled on top of the mac and cheese  every time i had to shuffle some salty ham out of the way to access what i actually wanted to eat  and that was way more work than i wanted to put in    the mac   cheese itself was worth the praise  it was smooth and cheesy  and paired well with the bread crumbs  however  i found the portion size to be overwhelmingly large since it was so heavy  about a 3rd in  i felt like i had to stop  luckily my boyfriend gave me words of encouragement  and helped me eat half of it  this dish would be much better served in half the portion size  and without the ham  i wouldve preferred a pig plushy and a bowl of salt  
location  about a 7 minute walk from st  patrick subway station  its on baldwin street so there are tons pf restaurants around   price  pancit bihon with pork   10  3  and kare kare  18   food  the flavourings were amazing  the pacit has fried glass noodles with pieces of perfectly crispy pork belly  which is one of my favourite filipino foods  i think this one is the best bang for your buck  the kare kare is a thick beef stew thats bursting with flavour  they offer to give you rice which complements the stew well  the portion sizes are medium to large  for a girl   everything is on the saltier side  but that may be necessary for the awesome taste  so remember to drink lots of water after    service  the waitress was very accommodating and food came relatively fast    overall  very delicious restaurant that id definitely go back to  especially for the pork belly slices    next time i want to try the purple ube dessert  the menu items are quite pricey  but you can just order ube ice cream  which isnt listed on the menu  
this airport makes no sense and has gotten to big for its britches   the gates layout sucks and you cant tell who is coming or going   it is hot and there are very limited charging stations   the tsa folks all had their cheerios peed in and were very rude   the rental car area while nice is a 20min bus ride   all in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport 
traveling through az on a cross country road trip and caught a stone in phoenix  arrived at safelite without an appointment and had my chip repaired within 30 minutes   awesome folks and most accommodating  totally reccomend safelite avondale 
every monday night at 9 they have a traditional quebecois music jam session with lots of fine fiddlers and other assorted instruments  it was a wonderful night preceded by good pizza and salad and a very friendly staff  bohemian in nature  full of students  warm and welcoming and across the street from the metro 
anyone can take a machine to a car  but steve is  not just a guy with a buffer  he runs a complete operation    every cars needs are different   mine was an issue of some type of industrial over spray   his follow up was great  as was his concern for my complete satisfaction   the best thing about steve is that hes not done until youre happy with the results   he truly stands behind his work 
fing amazing  so after doing some research on where to go that was close by to the pineville hospital  i looked into this most awesome place  my cut was just a shape up  but i didnt expect the shampoo and massage  wow  i definitely smoked a cigarette after  5 starts are definitely warranted  and if i could remember the stylist name  im sure ill remember next go around  blonde hair lady  gorgeous  thats is all i have to go on for a description for now  youll know her when you see her  she did an incredible job  price was nice too  everyone should check this place out 
i recently took my daughter out for a daddy  daughter date and the food was good but the service lacked their usual class   however  this is the second time in a few months i have been there and had the same problem 
i agree with all the other reviews  this place is horrible  the office employees are not very bright  it took a month and a half after filling out the application to know if we were approved or not  and we didnt find out until the day before our move in date  and that was with constant calling and going down to the office  they are extremely unorganized  and they are very polite and friendly  until you move in  then they act like they cant be bothered with you or your problems  they cant keep track of anything  it takes constant calling to make sure they are on top of your requests  i would not refer this apartment complex to anyone 
weve seen commercials here in the bay for joes   but weve never visited one until we drove by one in vegas last week   we walked in not really expecting too much  i was yelping as we were walking in     but lo and behold   we ordered a few  yes  a few   buckets of crabs and wow   they were so tasty   and  they didnt have any snow crabs that day  and had to substitute dungeness for snow    so we got a lot more for our money   i think this is the first time that ive ever gotten full off of crabs sans rice   though we didnt have vinegar with garlic and salt    the butter did just fine     service was also great and we were all glad that we finally got to experience joes   now its time to make like a tourist and head over to san francisco 
loe the local artists they have who have their work for sale  nice place to pick up a gift for someone
we rented a boat for the day and it was out of this world  one of the nicest things we have done in the area thus far  if we had the money we woudl join the boat club  we went to use a groupon but called and they gave us the same price direct  we had the boast for 4 hours and it was perfect
love this place  the prices are often very high but they have 75  off sales which are amazing  they also have classes and if you are not sure of a product  they have a helpful staff during their sales you can get some item you might otherwise might not be able to afford  they have the best tablecloths
very ice place  be careful if they are busy as it might take  awhile to get a staff person but its a nice place to stop for a quick drink   the house wine is actually really nice and they carry as good as cakebread  that impressed me 
it was ok  i liked the gentleman who helped us but a bit of a hard sales man  i prefer when they let you feel free to try the mattresses out yourself  i went down the road to mattress firm where i felt less pressured and where the old mattress is taken away and delivery is free  he was a nice gentleman though  i am just into a soft sell salesman
ok  some things i love an other   i think what  so i have gotten a great wash and then one i had to go back a the machine stopped so the total front of my car was dirty  but the pleasant thing is they let me run through again and they came and really brushed the front  very nice   the only think i never see any notice of hot was i pay 4 00 for so asked how do you know my car gets the hot wax  he said  what   the machines just knows  but how when i can pay and the car next to me comes in right in front of me  he just the computer just knows  o now i dont get the hot wax  i think everyone gets the same thing and i see no difference  its great how they give you a free 4 days re wash
we where here as part of the foo de tour and they  were very nice not a cheap pour and came around and gave us a second sip  they do wine tastings and seemed to have a nice selection of wine and beer  the wine they gave us to same was a very nice rose
love the chicken  which they had more side optiosn but love teh taste of the chicken 
love love love it   walking distance from my hotel  nicest staff ever  best happy hour   the mini chimis with jalapeno cream cheese were excellent   my waiter john  5 pm on monday  was awesome   the bill for it all was hilarious  what with the 99 cent margaritas     thanks for a great time from someone visiting from seattle with a foot cast on   lovely patio and fountains 
if im in this neighbourhood  this is where i go for lunch   they have the best lunch specials     soup  hot   sour or corn your choice   plus spring roll or deep fried beef momo  your choice   your meal  6 or 7 things to choose from  which include tingmo  steamed bun  plus rice   its filling and will satisfy anyone with an appetite    ive been at dinner but the lunch deals are so good   i usually only do lunch and its where the 5 stars come in   value at dinner is a lot less even though the food is still very good 
i went for lunch one day   a friend has recommended i try the goat taco   the guy who took my order just got me one to start   the salsa they brought with it was good and the taco was flavourful   id go back   after reading some reviews  i think ill try the fish next    i found them to be very friendly and laid back    
its somehow impressive how incompetent this location is  i ordered 2 hard shell beef and cheese tacos  carne asada fries with no sour cream and beans  chips  guac and a mountain dew  i went through the drive through and waited 10 minutes for my order   and somehow  someway they managed to screw up every single item i ordered  i received a dr pepper  tacos with lettuce and fries with beans  the guacamole was technically correct but was a liquidy mess  i didnt have time to unwrap every single item so i only caught the drink being wrong  but needless to say i am never returning here again 
while i enjoy the mgm grand hotel  resort   i am not a huge fan of the buffet  i have tried 3 times and have been disappointed every time    my issue is in comparison  the higher price sets an expectation that doesnt deliver  most people want to feel like they are getting what they pay for and here just doesnt feel that way  the food does not sit for too long and there is a sizable selection    the mgm group has had deals that included free or cheap buffets and that makes sense    if youre paying for a buffet i would suggest going over to excalibur 
so so good  favorite pizza place in town  chicago style thin crust  square slices  sweet sauce  delicious 
weird place  the only lights on after sunset are red  the staff are rude  all of them  always  its like the soup nazi if he sold sub par sandwiches with the ambiance of a cheap brothel  no thanks 
i love the local joint  i go there often and and have there wonderful spinach salad with the warm dressing and local cheese  my husbands loves the burgers and homemade potato chips  the owners a great people 
deliciously filling tacos   i was hesitant to try it but after expressing my gluten  allergy  they seemed receptive to my request for the cook to change gloves before making my food   ive had no issues with gluten contamination with the tacos  corn tortillas  or the chips and salsa   its definitely a local favorite and always packed so calling in carry out is a great option 
my husband rob and i are so lucky we found this gem of an animal clinic  we have an elderly cat  so the care that he receives at this stage in his life is of upmost importance  all the docs and staff are amazing  but we have had particularly phenomenal experiences with dr  jon  odebralski   he takes the time to really discuss the issues from all directions  we know our cat leonard is in extremely capable hands  
worst kfc in scotland  very greasy and nothing near as good ad others i have been too 
some of the best authentic thai food  even on their buffet  i would know since i lived there for 30 years 
this club was hot hot hot   dont be intimidated by the line  it  does  move   we ended up here on a thursday night by accident  completely unplanned vegas trip   totally underdressed but went anyway  girls  just fyi  dress to the nines if you go  makes it easier to skip the line  werent on any list unfortunately  didnt realize we were going to end up clubbing that night    so had to pay full cover and stand in line for a 1  2 hour  we got there at 11 30 so it wasnt horribly bad  but it was well worth it  drinks are super expensive  but they pour heavy and the bartenders are fast   placed is packed of course   music and decor is off the hinges   danced well into the night   left at 3 a m  and there was still people waiting in line   then headed off to seamless  which is a whole nother review   
we come from san diego   and we can defenetly say this place was amazing   food was on point   and their orchata is delicious   the beans with chorizo are really good too   our server was super nice and attentive   thank you for the amazing service rego 
the after dinner mint was the best part of this meal   the service was absolutely terrible from the moment we say down   the waitress wanted to take our order when we hadnt gotten water or drinks yet     appetizers were ok  nothing special about tomatoes soup or caesar salad     the veal medallions came out so well done it was actually impressive   my friend actually mentioned something to the waitress and she rolled her eyes and asked what he wanted her to do about it   ended up sending it back for a filet cooked medium which came out no more than 3 minutes later and looked like it had been under a warmer all night   desert was good  nothing amazing but made up for the main course   like i said  the little candies on the way out were delicious but not worth the  80 i spent for my meal 
very happy  they came to me  took care of both my boys in all their wreckless tornado ness  gave them a great report and charged a fair price  ive found my new groomer 
found this place by my apartment complex i just moved in to  there seems to be a ton of car wash places to choose from within a relatively short distance from each other  i was greeting genuinely by a gentleman who took the time to explain the various offerings of the place  i am super weary of machine style car washes  preferring hand car washes but i am not going to pay  35 every time i need one    the car wash itself is not rough  neoprene wetsuit material  and there is no top spinning wash mechanism to mar the paint on your car roof which is an attractive quality of this car wash  when my car exited the wash it looked good  no scuffs like i had seen in other pics and it sat under a covered parking  final wiped own area  the kids wiping my car down did miss some obvious areas within the car doors and back inside door  not a problem but i get it    pay for a top tier package and your car should be returned to you in top condition  i get it  but i realize i am more detailed than whomever dries my car so i am always going to go over my car after with quick detailer  since my car is new its not that hard to clean  i was happy of the job and bought the vip pass  i will return here  hope it continues to be as great as the initial visit  i do recommend a post detail spray of your own liking from your favorite brand after any wash no matter where you go  if you really care about and want to take care of your car as much as you should    lastly the employees were all very nice people  sincere and kind  happy to have moved here
tried to go this morning and have gone off and on for years  its hot in there like stagnant air to start  we asked for a half order of biscuits and gravy you and were given a full and obviously charge for a full  i asked for a child orange juice and was given a huge to go cup  we have a small child so we asked for extra napkins those never came and they never do every time weve been  our son started getting a little crazy so we decided it was time to leave my husband asked for it to go cup and was met with a scowl from the other waitress  we wont b back
enjoyed a fabulous italian dinner  our server eugene  formerly from roka akor  as always phenomenal   knew the menu and specials  recommendations were excellent choices   very professional  when you make a reservation or walk in request eugenes station you will not be sorry  the manager and hostess of this new restaurant were very visible and made inquiry as to the service and food  refilling our waters and beverage   the pesto  served with the great assorted bread basket is superb   this is a true winner   eating outside you see the beautiful fountain  enjoy  
im originally from the east coast and south so i was happy when they brought this chain to las vegas   i will admit the food here is not on the healthy side so if youre looking for a diet friendly establishment  i would suggest going elsewhere  but this is not why i rated this place 3 stars  the milkshakes are awesome as i am a fan of the chocolate flavored ones and they have a huge menu of these to choose from ranging from their regular chocolate  mocha  or hersheys dark syrup  also  i enjoy their chili mac supreme meals with a plate of fries    one of my gripes is that when south point expanded their casino  they seem to have a lot of wasted space that couldve been used to make this restaurant space larger because this restaurant is almost always packed with a long line  however  if you are in a hurry  you can always just order takeout and possibly sit by the deli restaurant tables section or booths both near the sportsbook to eat the meal 
im from the east coast but for the longest time  have heard of this place and not ventured in to try a burger until yesterday   first thing i enjoyed were the complementary salted roasted peanuts  this was good because its great for people that are hungry and cannot wait to be served   my friends went during the evening after 5pm and there wasnt much of a wait to order  to pretty much sum up why this place is awesome   no wait in line establishment was clean extra toppings for free two of those high tech fancy coke product dispensers that pours 10 15 different types of beverages  good location off the las vegas blvd for those on the south end of the strip   this place is up there with in n out burger and is less of a wait 
i checked this place out in between work one time for lunch with a coworker  i couldnt believe there was an actual place with lobster rolls  i am a harsh critic because i frequent boston  my original place of birth quite a bit and have had it fresh there  i ordered their original maine lobster roll with fries  i liked the presentation when the roll came out with the claws on the top of the toasted bun  the roll tasted great  it wasnt too seasoned  not too garlicy  the lobster meat was fresh and i will definitely go back to this establishment 
great tacos  fast service but not  fast food    its made to order  really awesome tacos   highly recommended  gotta try it if you like street tacos  best ive ever had 
this was probably the worst medical experience i ever had  from the rude people up front to the practice manager tanya  they scheduled me to come in 3 weeks later i arrive and am told we take your insurance just not if you are a new patient  3 weeks and 20 miles in the car and they wont see me  what a joke  nothing but a bunch of greedy doctors and there lack of   practicing real medicine where the patient comes first  not here  they just want your money   
very rude   im a frequent customer here i came almost every week but the owner is extremely rude  many times hes said that we always mess everything up and all we do is order extra topping but were paying for them  we were good customers but he always gave us an attitude  our last draw was when we went to order and he had a new cashier and she took our order and hereh the owner came out and checked the order and he told his cashier in front of us  this people are always a problem  who says that  customers are always a priority and specially when we always brought our good manners and respect for his business  hes a very rude person and has no respect towards people  its has not been the first time that he treated us wrong  im never going there again  do not recommend this place     
wow  2 and a half years since my other review  they are doing much better than when they first opened  my wife has eaten there several times recently  she and i ate there last week  seems default spicy level is mild  its not a big place  so it fills up  one of the better restaurants in downtown mesa  and convenient to the mesa arts center  last week we got there just after 6pm  beat the rush  had a good dinner and made our 7pm show at the mac 
very nice    the place is so cute and welcoming  stuff is really nice and professional   food is delicious  whats most important food is fresh and delicious    you can tell from the first bite   i loved that the menu is not 3 pages long but one small and easy  enough to choose for your taste   huge choice on the beverage list any coffee or lattes you would only imagine    in general  the ambience is warm and very cozy like if you were in your friends home  would recommend  luckys   to any of my friends and family  and definitely will be back there again   good luck to you guys
great food delivered right to my door in less than an hour   what more can you ask for   i have not been to the actual restaurant  it is definitely one of the best place to order delivery ive ever seen 
sadly  it isnt possible to give them zero stars   set up an appointment and they never showed up   no phone call   would not return my phone call that day  or at any time since then   i dont know how theyve been in business for 50 years with such abysmal customer service 
i cant even begin to say how impressed i was with blue bird carpet cleaning      blue bird is by far the best carpet cleaner ive ever used   you wont find better services and the price is very reasonable  i was referred to blue bird by a close friend that uses there services for foreclosured properties  the gentleman that came out to my house were hard working and very friendly  they arrived promptly  moved my furniture  and after a few hours  my carpet was clean and the tile was sparkling again    since then  i have had blue bird carpet cleaning come out to my house once a year and i have received the same excellent workmanship  i cannot recommend blue bird enough 
this is a nice  big space  and table service is our preferred mode of ordering in a non english language  as i get stressed out trying to speak french with other people behind me  potentially impatient  while i try to string together words  so  its a good mix of fast food and regular resto   we had a poutine  a grilled cheese with apple and honey  and a side of fries with mielnaisse  honey mayo  between three of us  the grilled cheese was a little too much bread for the other ingredients  but the fries were perfect    fairly thin  good and greasy without being gross  hot and fresh   the bathrooms in the back are asian themed with different asian characters on each door  this was a little stressful   going from french  english to asian  still not sure if they are actually mens  womens or unisex  but im going to assume the latter  clearly not worth docking them stars  but it was funny watching a little girl  maybe seven  walk to the bathrooms and then yell for her dad in a worried voice to come and help her choose which bathroom she was supposed to use   getting our check was slow  but this may just be a montreal on the weekend thing  because the same was true at every restaurant we tried  overall  its just what you want  or what i want  at least  from a poutine  fry place 
i dont have much to add that hasnt been said before   between two of us  we had popcorn at the o performance as our appetizer  then appetizers at fix as our dinner   the spicy tuna on rice cakes was fantastic  although a little annoying to serve two people five pieces   then again  we got three burgers  so perhaps we were supposed to compromise on who got the extra burger vs th extra ahi   we were more diplomatic and split both  but cutting a tiny sushi bite in half after drinking champagne is quite the exercise in motor skills   i think there were an even number of mac n cheese sticks    i couldve eaten a whole second order quite easily   dipping the fries in the sauces that came with the sticks was also lovely   yum   plus  the two of us had plenty of food for a price reasonable enough to allow for gelato at the cafe  or crepes at jean philippe  for dessert 
dr  schroeder won us over with her compassion and care during end of life for one of our dogs last year    since then we have made this our home vet and recommend it to everyone we speak with  all of our dogs are well cared for there and we trust them with the care of our pets 
im new to the area and wanted to check out some other nail salons after getting a hang nail from my last place that hurt  i walked in  no appointment for a mani  pedi and eyebrow wax  i felt their prices were a little high   the manager  lilly provided my mani  pedi   eye brow wax and it was ok  the water was really cold when i put my feet in the bath and the paraffin wax was super hot  like almost burning my feet hot  the hand  leg  foot massage was pretty nice  i would probably look elsewhere 
we decided to board our puppy here over labor day weekend and took her to the daycare the week before to get her accustomed to the staff and environment  both times she came home exhausted from a full  fun day at daycare  grandma picked her up for us from her boarding stay and was exhausted  to me thats always a huge plus that shes being active and were getting our moneys worth  i loved getting reports she was enjoying her time with the other dogs and playing games like chase  tag and having fun in the pool    the staff is great with communication via phone and their staff responds to facebook posts as well  ive had no issues with being mistreated by their front desk staff on the multiple times ive been there    i also appreciated that my emergency contact checked in on our pet over her visit and they brought her out so she could make sure she was doing ok since it was the first time leaving her for multiple days and she has separation anxiety    i admit i was a bit leery with the negative reviews but i can only suggest to try it yourselves before forming an educated opinion  weve found our new home away from home for our dog child 
i bought my wedding corset from belle and vowed to come back to get properly fitted for a bra  ladies  if you havent done this yet  it is life changing  im a plus size girl with a difficult to find bra size  two years later      2nd wedding anniversary is cotton  my husband teased me about buying me new bras for our anniversary theme  personally  i thought this was a great idea and went down there  these bras are sexy  flirty and i feel great in them  great enough to donate my old bra and walked out wearing one of my new ones  i walked away with 3 new bras and one on order    its a cute  trendy store with a great selection of lingerie and helpful staff that can tell you if your bras are fitting right or not  i probably wont ever buy another bra anywhere else now 
dined here with my mother in law and husband the other night  it might smell fishy as soon as you walk in because they have a live lobster tank  we had great service from our waitress  katie  they overcooked my steak and when katie came back to check on us  we let her know  she notified her manager and i was personally delivered a fresh steak from the kitchen by the chef who asked me to cut into it while he was present  i showed him my old steak and he agreed that it was definitely medium  not medium rare  the manager was fantastic  we complimented our waitress and he was genuinely appreciative  my mother in law loves rl so im sure well be back and hopefully get seated in katies section again  ask for katie   youll get great service  no  im not related to her at all  i promise 
i will gladly give lunch a munch 5 stars  ive only had food delivered and havent gone into the business  but they are always nice over the phone  the delivery guy is always polite and nice   delivery service is usually super quick too   great food  good prices  great for an alternative when i dont feel like going out for lunch  im glad i found them 
i have had excellent experience with this caterer  the menu selections were perfect  delivery was on time  the food was hot and tasted wonderful    you have lots to choose from and ms woodson was very helpful in making my final choices  these folks take your event to a more polished refined level  ive used them twice and wouldnt even consider going anywhere else 
its the local to the apartment complex so its handy  tons of tv food is average though
i used this dealership to buy my honda civic hybrid that i had been leasing  attained the lease from another dealership   the sale was fairly smooth and straightforward because i was buying according to the end terms of the lease  but they still got me  i was talked into buying a service contract  it made sense  at the time  given the uncertainty of the life of the hybrid battery  the documentation that they gave me did not include the list they showed me in the office which went over all of the features that were supposed to be covered  so i ended up quite confused later when i thought oil changes were covered but the service department didnt seem to know anything about it   so i never used it  at all  i did receive a contract that guaranteed a refund for the cost of the service plan if none of the benefits were used  with lots of fine print   down the road  i decided that i wanted to pay the car off early and pulled out the contract to see if this action would affect my refund  it was not clear to me  so i called the number for the company responsible for the contract   signet financial group   and the number was disconnected  i tried calling the shadyside honda salesman who sold it to me  but he was no longer working with the company  so i asked for the financial manager  he was not in  so i left a message with the receptionist  he also wasnt there or wasnt available the next few times i called and none of my calls were returned  i was so angry about the signet fraud and the lack of response from the dealer  i was afraid to go there in person to find this elusive manager  i would have been all tears   i ended up just going ahead and paying off the car early which i am pretty sure voided my eligibility for the  1540 that was to be owed to me by a company that no longer exists     if you bought a service contract from this or any dealer before march 2011 that has signet on the contract  you may wish to seek legal help  here are a couple of resources i found  http     www oregonlive com  business  index ssf  2013  11  signet_financial_settlement_lo html and http     www ripoffreport com  r  signet financial group  vacaville california 95696 6836  signet financial group gregg lehmanall seasons rv warranty fraud vacaville california 1097967   self review  dumb for buying into this shit  too passive and easily defeated

what we got  eel on rice  sashimi bento  taste  really good  portion  decent  price  expensive but they were generous so its alright  they gave thick cuts of sashimi   time  took a long time to get our food  overall  yes i would come back
this place is always a hit or miss for me  last time i waited around 43 mins for my food when i was on a tight schedule  they most likely forgot our order      this time was a good experience  we both got their rich tonkotsu shoyu ramen  october special  and it was pretty good  i was hesitant at first since i only like some of their ramen but i tried it anyways   12 99 is pricey but its okay since i normally get the 3x chatsu ramen which is like  15 something  i will be coming back  always 
great customer service  and very knowledgable  as one of the many vape places ive been to around here in vegas and ive seen many and theyre all one great vape community  these guys helped out the most  flavors are on point     lychee  dragonchee  and cranchee so far are absolute favorites of mine  and any builds they can do or have done  manny looked out for my issues on clones which i had no clue i had lol  and brought me to the light when my build was finished by mike and set me up with a standard k100 mod  the igo w is an awesome cloud blower and flavorful vape mod  i recommend that if your a newbie like myself to the rda side and only been vaping on tanks  have one of these guys show you whats up  theyre experts and know exactly whats the best fit for a certain individuals vaping needs  awesome service and great staff  so if you vape and happen to be in the area and need some advice  and or place to chill kick it and vape  come through to vapors union try out the juices at the juice bar  youll be glad you did 
i found out about this place on yelp actually and decided to give it a try  glad i did because the pizzas taste very good and the pricing is awesome  just  8 and can put whatever topping on your pizza that youd like   the only thing i would say is that it was just a bit too cold in the restaurant in my opinion  the pizza got cold kinda fast  however  that didnt stop me from going back a second time  ill be back again soon with my boyfriend because our son loves the pizzas here 
i only had a pedicure  but well worth it   all the staff greets you  price is amazing  pedicure range 20 35  i had the full pedicure  25 includes the massage  scrub  and polish etc  definitely coming back  it took me 30 min for my pedicure which was perfect because i had another appt to go to 
we really looked forward to a perfect experience but only a couple things that semi ruined our time   there was an obnoxious older couple that kept blowing their noses quite loudly into the napkins  it happened several times during our meal which made it difficult to enjoy   other than that service was nice   we had the 16 course tasting menu and loved every bite  we received copies of our menu and a bag of goodies to take   highly recommend trying this indulgent adventure once 
good place iv always had great food here  its loud and packed most of the time but its kid friendly 
very good food  fresh tasting and well executed  service is friendly but youll need to stay on top of your server to get your drinks refreshed and to ask for condiments  etc  i had skirt steak  chicken enchiladas and carnitas tacos  all were first rate  my wife had shredded beef tacos and pupusas  which were both tasty and filling  even my daughters cheeseburger was good    it was obviously grilled over a flame  prices are very reasonable  the health rating is 94  comfortably in the  a  zone  customers were almost all hispanic  which speaks to the authenticity of the place  i definitely will go back and hope to have a similarly positive experience next time 
average at best  and overpriced  several much better caribbean restaurants in charlotte  and less expensive  seek those out instead 
the junkyard breakfast was not good at all  flavorless chili  home  fries  that did not have any crunch on the outside  seriously  did they boil these things    everything was underseasoned and bland  the grits were oversalted  and the onion rings tasted frozen  the mens room was simply scary and needs to be given a serious scrubdown  ive had the carolina burger there before and it was pretty good  at least late at night after a few beers  but this second trip was a major disappointment  charlotte has a lively and rapidly improving restaurant scene  but too many of these triple d type restaurants in hipstery locales are way overrated 
food was good but derek was awesome  well come back as long as he helps us again      derek you rock dude   youre a good singer   
terrible service ok food  took about 1 hour to get a personal pizza and another 45 minutes for the check which never came  who knows where the server disappeared to   
cheese curd heaven   great service too  visited yesterday for lunch and george was our server   this was my first time in wisconsin and this place will be what i will miss the most 
every time i get gas and pay at the pump at this location  it never fails i have to go inside to get the receipt  i dont mind going inside  but what would be the purpose paying with your card at the pump then  some of us dont have time to go inside  it is also important to get your receipt because if there is an unauthorized amount being charged on your account  what proof do you have on what the real transaction amount was  its not that difficult to put paper in the machine  several others and i make this place known as the place that never has paper in the machine  its so bad that we place bets on if theyll have to go inside or not to retrieve the receipt  so pathetic  who knows may be they want you to go inside to buy something and thats why you can never get your receipt at the pump  like i said some of us dont have time to go inside your little store  i wouldnt have written this review  but i am just getting tired of the laziness  its not difficult to put paper in the machine 
ive been coming here almost 3 years now  james is great and cuts my hair perfect every time   i only recommend scheduling ahead of time because he gets booked up pretty fast 
the theme is a rum bar  its decor is not anything special  stopped in for a drink   i had a imperial lager which was good  my friend had a mojito which seems to be a house specialty  she said it was good  the bartender was attentive and introduced himself when we arrived   overall a nice place to grab a drink and maybe a bite  ill stop again when i have more time 
love the groomer at pet gourmet   she does an amazing job on all my dogs   one of my dogs is very hard on other groomers since she hates being groomed   but she loves going to pet gourmet   they have also helped me find the best food for our dog who was alerguc to everything else we gave her    great people running this business   would highly recomend to anyone 
first time  5 stars   i seriously left dreaming about this place and couldnt wait to return   really fresh fish   ayce sushi thats affordable   ayce includes desserts  i ordered 3    yes  i have a sweet tooth    special nigiri items can be ordered as well   long wait  but it was totally worth it    no sashimi  second time  4 stars   wait wasnt as long   fish wasnt as fresh   overall would definitely return to this off the strip ayce sushi joint   its such a good deal and the fresh is relatively fresh   if youre not into sushi they have other options as well   till next time goyemon 
friendly  great food  happy hour 4 7 and 11pm to i forget  anyways my onion better than pts      always drink specials and good variety of food  games you actually win on  5 stars all the way and best location 
ok i have seen a good amount of shows here  for this not as fancy or big name show its the best i have seen here this guy was so funny and had a good size crowd everyone impressed and laughing  the opening acts ignore them  when joe the main guy comes out hes full of energy and expect to partake if close to stage  i really liked this show very good not for anyone who offends easy and for sure not younger peps  see it and enjoy this one  better them the common comedy showed by far    lmao great 
they added to the staff  seems harder to get in for some odd reason thou and be seen there now  they raised there rates the detox also no longer included it cost extra now and i was rushed last time  unfortunately i dont see myself coming back as i just found a new place not far that is open later and thats more convenient  and you can walk in no appointment needed a well set staff of 6 or so  same price and offers ion detox which is huge to me  one thing i learned in vegas a business can change fast here and this one was not for the good  during my massage i cant count how many times he got up and left the room and i heard lots of talking thru out my massage from staff talking to staff including one massaging me talking  i couldnt relax or enjoy it  i still felt like i needed a massage and sore  after leaving here and was disappointed and did end up at another place 
they are always so nice and accommodating here  love the shwarma wraps  always fresh and tasty  definitely recommend 
tree country has become my absolute favorite sushi restaurant in cleveland  i get the california roll wrapped in yellow tail   tuna   and salmon and it is absolutely dynamite every time  5  5
clean store good food but bad service  the crew hardly acknowledges you  wish they also had some spicier options on menu  price is decent for area 
i popped in with friends since they had never had the montreal treat and heard about the spot on their bus tour   when we walked up there was already a line  but it moved quickly and we were seated in 5 minutes   we had cheeseburgers and shared a classic poutine   ive had better poutine and maybe i should have steered my friends to some of the more inventive offerings   i had a great beer with ginger undertones  which i will never forget   its nice that its open 24 hours for that poutine fix 
oh boy  awesome food  you have to try the mutton curry  its simply awesome and the garlic naan melts in your mouth 
i literally havent been here in 10 years  they did change a lot of things i was disappointed they dont have the meatballs and garlic pizza anymore  but i got a pepperoni sausage pizza and some hot wings  let me tell you the hot wings were amazing pizza was great services really good their fries were the exact same as red robin but way better nice and crispy  nice place to come to if you want that down home chicago hometown bar  i will definitely return
complete crooks spent over  3000 rebuilding my motor on my toyota also took over 3 month to get done the first time brought it back numerous times they kept blaming me for the issues that it was having because i took it off road or this or that when the truck never saw the dirt again after it went to them and three months later truck doing exactly what i brought it in for again  i ended up selling the truck for nothing and eating the cost that i spent with them because i couldnt stand to go back and deal with their smug bullshit
unusual for today  dr  medeiros is  almost  always on time   he takes all the time he needs to do the job   has no problem referring   he knows that he doesnt know it all   refreshing   not sure he is taking new patients   if not  so sorry   he is a keeper 
we have been coming to valle luna for many years   its a good thing that we travel so far to get here   or we might go here daily   which would be hard on the wallet and the waistline      you can always count on it being because the food is so great    we have never had anything but great food   same is true for the service   service normally is fairly fast  but you are never hustled to leave   portions are large   perhaps accounting for slightly higher prices    they have great specials tuesday   wednesday and thursday nights    if you have room for desert   get their wonderful sopapliias  be sure to ask for the caramel sauce 
stayed here for two nights in a room close to the front desk with more than enough parking  only spent time in the room to sleep   otherwise we were down at the pools  which are pretty awesome if you have kids  she loved the waterfalls and slides   only ate at the hotel once at the poolside bar  and it was standard fare  we also ate at the restaurant on the bottom right where they have the breakfast buffet  and that buffet was excellent  i noticed a lot of reviewers found bugs and had a lot of issues with pests and parking  we did not find any pests in our room  which was clean  and we didnt have parking issues  however  we had to drop some of our friends off in other rooms and as we drove around  i remember thinking about what a strange property this was and how i absolutely would not want to stay in any of the buildings up the big hill  nothing about that area of the resort looked to be convenient 
an absolutely abomination and an insult to anyone who has ever patronized a restaurant on this planet  after waiting a fair amount of time for a table  we ordered drinks and food from what i would consider an extremely limited menu   we allotted ourselves 90 minutes to eat and then walk 20 feet over to the hockey game  which anyone will tell you is probably more than enough time  apparently  it is not enough time at this restaurant  after our drinks came  we didnt get a visit from the server  ever  but we watched as entire tables were sat and fed while we waited  i pulled the server over and requested an update  and she told us the food was almost ready  15 more minutes  and we stood up and left  we had sat there 55 minutes with no food  and we ordered basic  what i would consider quick  fried bar food  we almost missed face off at the hockey game because this place sucked so much    the server chased after me and said not to worry and that they would take care of the drinks  um  yes you will  idiot 
we switched our hotel to polo towers over super bowl weekend based on a groupon  and we are really happy we did  we were somewhat skeptical because it was a discounted room and there are some negative reviews on yelp  but we found the studio to be a perfect size  clean  and comfortable    the murphy bed was no problem whatsoever  the fridge was empty  thank you   and there was a full on coffee maker  not a tiny cheap one   friendly staff  a nice convenience store with decent coffee  bagels  wed definitely stay here again   they did bring up the opportunity to upgrade our room in exchange for the timeshare discussion  but the guy wasnt pushy at all and we never heard about it again 
really awesome food  and the prices arent bad either  very reasonable  i had the 6 oz  rabble burger with fries  the portions were huge  the burger was amazing  lots of flavour  not dry  and there is a decent amount of toppings to choose from  their garlic mayo is amazing by the way  definitely try that out   the only thing i didnt like was instead of sliced cheese the cheese was grated  but thats not a big deal and it still tasted really good  ill definitely be back 
not sure how to feel about this place the guy at the entrance almost intimidated the bartender    mustve been the owner or brew master    he was friendly tho with me at least but again the bartender looked scared    the beer they make local is a little better than the one at ellis island  mind you they charge  2 25 per pint there   when i went it was happy hour so the beer was  5    i shouldve tried the guest tap as it looked way better but i said let me support local even tho few beers on guest tap where from henderson nevada   
just saw deadpool for  4 49    no lines    everybody seem happy to be there    even i was happy to be there      now the bad     2 couples sat right next to me with one gentleman sitting right next to me    i moved to the left one seat    he started    do i smell or something      if i was his date or wife i would run away    fast    eventually i had to move cause they all loaded with running noses and coughing up a storm    there this is my story and i am sticking to it    hahahaha
gets the job done  had a weiss and a light beer     got me buzzed and i think ive had enough   unpasteurized beer is good for you in moderation  
dim sum  pot stickers were okay and spicy thai noodles  chicken  seemed a little bland  even though we asked for it spicy  enjoyed the pork buns 
absolutely horrible  i live very close and used to go here quite a bit but i finally had enough and will not be back  the service is completely terrible  we have literally waited over half an hour for service on multiple occasions   i cant count the number of times ive sat way too long with an empty drink  both at tables and at the bar   it doesnt matter if theyre busy or not  the service is always horrendous  once we specifically asked to be seated in the one good servers section and they wouldnt accommodate us even though there was plenty of room  every person i know who has been here  which is a lot of people  have had the same experience  its a shame because its one of the only places around that isnt full of smoke and they show all the games  but ill just be staying at home from now on   absolutely do not recommend 
it was amazing  first yelp review ever   i was raving about it and promised id give a good review so here it is 
holy cow new favorite breakfast spot  they have everything  best eggs benedict ive ever had  comfortable  great service and their bacon is cooked to perfection  come eat here  just do it 
this is my go to place for good beer   i really like that they rotate their beer all the time   the have many screens and every game you can imagine    give this place a try 
fantastic bbq and service   my whole family enjoyed it   best we found in the charlotte area so far 
excellent japanese restaurant in a great location  for those of you sushi lovers out there  this is a great find  excellent service  great atmosphere  excellent food  if you crave those pieces of fish daily and nightly  like i do  then this is the place for you  excellent food and a great price  for those you of you not so into the raw fish scene  they have other excellent meals as well 
as a first time mom i had so many questions about what the birth entails  what my rights are as a birthing mom and how the heck i was going to birth a child with all the horror stories other people have    i finished the course feeling confident and ready for the blessing of birth  the fears that i had were talked through as i learned how birth actually works and how to work with the body instead of against it 
alejandro is a great server  he always takes care of my family when we come in  he makes the dinner enjoyable and fun
amazing find   fresh and tasty   warm bread to start   the house salad was a meal in and of itself   the red diablo sauce on the bigoli noodles was absolutely authentic and very  very delicious   a real gem   the service was awesome as well   only here for a few days  but we know where to go for authentic italian the next time we are in town 
im always critical of barbershops because they usually dont have a good walk in system and questionable barbers   this place has a good walkin system they just dont really follow it   i got here around 11 45    i left work early to get a haircut and be back to work by 1 00   i waited til 12 33 and left   i was  4 in line and i counted 9 that went before me    not sure if they had appointments   after the last guy i just walked out   the staff is nice     all the barbers looked like they had skill   i got a haircut here a while ago before and it was a great job   i was really disappointed because this place looks cool and its so close to my work   i probably wont be back     its a little weird but appointments cost  25 and walk ins are  18      not sure why     if you are ok with waiting for an hour this place would be great for you
awesome  great patio space   4 kinds of cooling at the bar is super refreshing on a hot day  nice selection of mixed drinks   craft beers  bartenders are toats friendly   great for recommendations to other local bars  restaurants   of course  the pasties are great too  lamb   mint and the tikka masala were stand outs  right off main st in old town   definitely worth the trip 
had dinner on 7  19  we were promptly greeted and sat at a long bar table inside  i really liked the atmosphere  very clean and modern  but still warm with the wooden tables  we ordered the specialty brat by chef beckett with pickled onions as well as the kosher brat with kraut  all of their ingredients are homemade i as i was informed by our waitress  i really liked the dijon mustard and thought the kraut was fresh  not too salty  we also ordered fries with dipping sauces  i assume the fries are twice fried  so if you like them crunchy  order them up  the truffle aioli and bleu cheese bacon dipping sauces were best  sriracha dipping sauce is a good concept  but wasnt particularly flavorful    the beer selection is great  green flash palate wrecker was priced very well  as was the rasputin we ordered  a nice selection of a variety of beers  which i thought were fairly priced   sorry to bud and coors fans  get your cheap beer water fix elsewhere  
ive been going here for 13 years and have never had a problem  service is great  quality food for a decent price 
this was the best sub ive had in a long time  fresh sliced meat  awesome sour dough bread and the service was top notch   austin and his female co worker made our experience here some of the best service weve had in a long time  well done 
this place is ah mazing   it has become my new favorite steak place    service is excellent  the hostesses are so polite and friendly  the servers are attentive and knowledgeable    the ambience of the restaurant is wonderful  i love sitting on the patio and enjoying the serenity of the tivoli village with a great view overlooking the fountain  especially since the weather has been gorgeous    the food is to die for  i try to order something different each time  flavors and spices are paired together with such forethought   the meat is cooked to perfection every time   i dont think the pictures can do this place justice  you just have to come try it for yourself to understand how great the food is 
amazing find  took my kids here for the day  they loved feeding the geese and ducks  we also spent time watching the people fishing in the small ponds  great way to get back to nature  we also took the dog and he loved it here 
we cannot say enough good things about this company  called them up after discovering we had a huge beehive in our front yard  the woman on the phone was courteous and professional  called around 7pm and expected to get a recording  but happily they answered right away  she gave us a specific time to expect to have them meet us at the house  not a huge time range where you wait half your day for someone to come  they gave us an appointment promptly the next day    the guy arrived on time and was very knowledgeable about how to handle the issue  he worked efficiently and didnt leave behind a mess  he worked even through this summer heat of august  he also was mindful of warning us  our neighbors and all the pets to stay away while he worked for safety concerns    apparently we had an infestation of angry africanized bees that had several hives established right in the open    i love that theres a 90 day warranty to rely upon    this is exactly the kind of business we need to see more of in vegas  service with a smile  does the job well and completes everything promised  thank you so much 
food is delicious  service is okay  ambience is fancy  prices are pretty inflated  there are better steakhouses in town  imo 
this place was highly recommended by several friends so we checked it out  very high class atmosphere  the menu is a mario batali creation  they have tableside carving of certain steaks which has a nice touch  the steak was tasty and cooked to a perfect temperature  the real specialty is their extensive wine list  the service was excellent  knowledgeable staff and never had an empty water glass    beware  this place is very pricey  if you are looking for a high class steakhouse  this is it  definitely a great place to impress a date 
great variety of food and everything is delicious   food alone deserves 4 stars   however  the servers seemed friendly when they all shouted to welcome you while you walked in   later you would find they just too busy to give you some proper attention   the other thing   this places is wayyyy too noisy and chaotic than i can accept    maybe because i dont go to pub  club  drinking places a lot and this place is definitely not for me   i planned to catch up with a friend at dinner but i couldnt hear her at all and i have to yell to hear my own voice    too much for me     if you plan to have any conversation during dinner  dont go to this place   
i was expecting more from this place   but its just  a ok   food is nice but nothing impressive  tea doesnt have too much varieties  the most important thing i consider for afternoon tea  the ambience  atmosphere   here is not as good as i would imagine  perhaps because we had a large party sitting next to us and they were pretty loud and had people walking around  taking pics all the time    one good thing is they didnt kick us out even though we stayed for 3 hours  i heard that for windsor you can only stay up to 2 hours for afternoon tea   but they did stopped adding hot water to our teapots at some point 
very plain dim sum  nothing fancy at all  was a bit disappointed   as yelp describes it   a ok 
stopped before coming to a show at heinz hall  we ordered the inside out grilled cheese  it was awesome  im usually weary about ordering grilled cheese anywhere since you can make so cheap at home but the waiter suggested it  stuffed with cheese  bacon  tomato  then burnt cheese wrapped around the bread  it was large portion and could only eat half  definitely a must order  leftovers were just as good  waiter was friendly and helpful
the best brunch ive ever had  we had to wait ten minutes for a table so we were served complimentary  fresh squeezed orange juice  good coffee and nice service  brunch itself was great and menu has too many good choices to choose from 
i went to nakama on saturday for my birthday  i had a party of 9 and told the hostess my friend was in traffic and would be late  she insisted they could not seat us until everyone in my party arrived which to me seemed to inconvenience them more because we were occupying the lobby and seemed to be in the way  once seated  it took long to get everything  a long wait to order drinks  then receive our drinks  then long to take our order  my reservation was for 8 and by 8 45 we hadnt even put our food order in  i ordered a margarita and 30min later i still hadnt received it so my friend complained to the manager who was walking around  he was very apologetic and explained our waitress was actually a hostess and he bought me the margarita  that definitely saved the night and i am thankful for his generosity  the food is good  your basic hibachi food  i didnt order sushi but my friends seemed to enjoy it 
shiloh grill is set at a great location  right off of grandview  the food is pretty good nothing spectacular  but i cant say ive had a bad meal here  also the service is always good  the cocktail prices are a little steep  i ordered a muddled watermelon drink with cilantro and tequila  the drink was mostly ice and cost  11  but lesson learned with that one  they have a decent beer list so next time im sticking to beer 
i ate at brgr for the first time this weekend  although it was muggy outside we sat upstairs  with the ceiling fans going and a great view  i was glad we made that choice  for 7 oclock on a friday night it was pretty slow  we got seated right away and our waitress seemed almost bored  constantly checking on us which i guess is better than not  now on to the food  we all had the summer shandy cocktail  which was citrus vodka  yuengling and lemonade and it was delish  for apps we had the chips and crack dip and also the fried grilled cheese  both of which were delicious  we had to get a second order of the chips  the cheese dip is that good  we all had burgers which were also good  was it omg best burger i ever had in my life  no  but all in all  great service  great drinks and a good burger   a good time  oh and they also have valet for  3 which is a deal because parking down there can be a nightmare 
if i could i would give it zero stars worst place to go and eat worst service doesnt give you your order right and food is old please close this place or mange it batter
we always hit this place when staying at the belllagio   one of the best shrimp wonton noodle soups ive ever had with giant shrimp packed into their wontons and a delciously rich broth   also have had the wok fried penang style kweuy teaw with beef and it was perfect with very tender beef   dont know about the fancy dishes  but stick with the noodles and you wont be disappointed   i dont take price into account in my reviews  because everything in the casinos is overpriced 
since i moved out of the area  i miss a lot about madison   one of the things i really miss is montys   i made a point to bring several friends here and their assessment of this diner gone upscale was good as well   the food is diner classics with an updated touch as well as a few things that are probably best described as new american   the food is excellent  especially the numerous vegan and vegetarian options   the ambiance is clean and bright  the service good   the only downsides are that the wait can be long  especially on weekend mornings  and parking is limited 
the food is good here  i didnt get to try and mixed drinks though  i stayed with just the dos equis  but the atmosphere is nice and the setting fits the area  only been here once  the waiter we had only came around three times and ignored us when i tried to get his attention on several occasions  with him aside though  great place to try out and relax
i frequent this panera and usually am quite satisfied  today 5  15  17 my husband and i went way after the lunch rush  about 3 00 pm  upon ordering the cashier was great  no complaints  she informed me that the fuji apple chicken salad could only be made today with real apples as they had run out of the dried apples  i agreed that would be just fine  when i received my salad  the apple was cut in about 6 wedges  both ends of the stem included  it was thrown in the salad and was not done with any care  i had to pick them out  to top it off  i was given no dressing and had to go interrupt the workers that were mostly disinterested if i could get dressing  additionally the place was a mess and a female employee at the pick up counter  customer side  was playing around with a coworker behind the counter so loud that it was quite annoying  laughing and acting as though they were at the pool   so disappointed in this visit  i hope it was a fluke 
this is an updated review based on my visit last night compared to my last visit 4 years ago during peak hours   this club is everything a guy could ask for in a gentlemans club  beautiful girls with gorgeous bodies and surprisingly really fun personalities if you dont come off as a creep or asshole  i have high standards when it comes to women and looks and all the girls here were 8s and above  with 10s every 4 girls or so and 9s every other girl  no lie   the entrance i believe is  40 but make sure to call them to use the complimentary limo service to not only have that entrance fee waived  but arrive there in style in a stretch limo  dont even matter if youre by yourself  just make sure to tip the driver  5  each guy or gal in your party   the music was on point all 4 hours i was there and the dj deserves a raise for that  hed go from electronic  to hip hop  to techno with flawless ease and if there was a dance floor  i probably wouldve been on it  i salute you  dj   i do have 2 gripes if youd consider these gripes  nothing major   1  if youre an asthmatic  stay away  smoke everywhere  i dont even smoke yet i woke up the next day smelling like cigarettes still  thats how bad it is  small price to pay though for all the gorgeous women   2  so many places to sit  yet all the seats were taken because it was packed  only option was to take a girl to either the vip  champagne room  or rhino room   some tips from me   1  set a spending limit and dont use the atm in there  it hits you with a  45 atm transaction fee  no thank you   2  theres a back room where its  100 for 3 dances in a more secluded setting  they dont tell you this but theres also a  45 2 drink minimum for you and the girl so it comes out to  145 each time youre in there   3  dont be shy  if theres a really hot girl that you want  grab her before someone else does  these girls are the ones in high demand   4  some girls can be pushy  dont do anything unless you really want to  its your money  you do what you want   overall  an awesome experience and i highly recommend it if you have the cash 
ive been to xs  marquee  and omnia  and out of the 4 clubs  i couldnt really tell you the difference between hakkasan and the rest of them  i still had a great time but its not really unique  just like marquee and omnia  theres a main dance floor that plays edm and a smaller hip hop room called ling lings  the size of both the main floor and hip hop room are probably the exact same size as marquee  just like all the other clubs  drinks are expensive as hell  i feel like if you go to omnia  you dont really need to go to hakkasan   for guys and gals  get pre sale tickets beforehand  tickets at the door have been rumored to cost up to  100  as a guy  i only paid  45 online  plus you dont have to wait in an obnoxiously long line  sure you can be put on the guest list but by 9 30pm  the guest list line was already snaking around the outside so youll be standing outside for a hot minute waiting to get into a club that opens at 11pm   overall  its a fun club  dont get me wrong  i just feel like youve not really missing out on much if you go to either omnia or marquee instead 
presidential has always given us amazing customer service  on time  very clean and nice vehicles and amazing drivers  we mostly use scott  who i cannot say enough good things about  just an all around great guy  when scott has not been available  every other drive has been great  now our regular trips to vegas do not begin without presidential picking us up    
i was in town and dropped in on a thursday for evening class  prior i had emailed kru leo asking about what i should bring  etc   he responded very promptly and recommended that i bring all my gear as the class schedule depends on how many people show and how experienced they are  drop in fee is 20 dollars for a 2 hour session  which is very reasonable  the rough order of things on that day were  quick loosening up  stretching  then partnered calf and shin conditioning  jogging  then you carry your partner on your back once around the course  after that you jump rope for 3 to 4 rounds  2 minutes pace  30 seconds sprint   followed by shadow boxing  in between rounds you do knees and pushups  then you do partner drills  after that you start hitting pads  2 rounds each   then a couple rounds of sparring  followed by conditioning and stretching  very fun class  kru leo is very friendly and teaches very traditional thai style  which i was extremely happy about  he evaluates the students and groups them according to experience  so beginners dont feel overwhelmed and more advanced students can deepen their technique  the students are all very friendly and welcoming as well  kru leo emphasizes technique over power  which is the best indicator for a good instructor  please give this gym a try  you wont regret it 
brought my truck in for an oil change  i spoke with charlie on the phone and he was very kind and helpful  i met with him when i arrived and he explained what he was doing and why   im not too saavy  and what his crew found and his recommendations  i had a great experience and would be happy to go there for my future truck maintenance needs 
sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner  little pricey  but the quality of food was good  i love to share plates and this place is great for that 
buyer beware  read the fine print  bought this deal off of groupon hoping this would be a perfect answer for a single that doesnt like to cook anymore  beginning this review with a positive  it was nicely packaged   when it arrived food was still frozen  but i found the food very disappointing then lo and behold here came another package that i wasnt expecting  turns out once you have ordered  they keep sending  yikes  so called them right away cancelling   asked for a refund and to pick up the delivery  but they refused  so the package sits in my patio and rots because its not worth taking up space in my small freezer 
we got into town pretty late and decided to come eat here for dinner   we used the yelp check in for a tempura shrimp and egg roll was a nice treat before our entrees   my husband ordered the kung pao chicken which was flavorful and good  i got the seafood salad and it has a good portion that we shared  it taste was mediocre  i expected it to be more spicy  but it was not  there was a 2 man band that was entertaining because we kept catching him mis pronounce words in the songs  he mostly sang ed sheeren and some other top 40s  my husband kept waiting for him to play 80s  which he did not  i did notice there was a child still up and playing when its so late into the night  but i did come in on saturday night   this place wasnt so bad  but it didnt stand out or make an impression on me either 
omg     heather is the best aesthetician in the west valley  my eye lash extensions are gorgeous    see for your self     if your looking for someone to do lashes permanent makeup  waxing etc     beauty secrets by heather is the place to go    
finally a vietnamese restaurant in edinburgh  when i lived in the u s  i was a regular eater of vietnamese food  at least in the west coast you will find a vietnamese restaurant around every corner  and the quality is usually good and the food is very authentic  pho vietnam house in edinburgh is not bad  im not surprised that it is very well received by the public because it does deliver something different from the chinese  japanese  thai dining scene  especially for people who have not eaten any vietnamese food before   the lunch menu is good value for money  the food is pretty good  too  but they are a bit too sweet for my liking  the portion for the stew beef with rice is generous  but the pho is smaller than expected  you may feel hungry later if you only order the pho  i wish the pho vietnam house would include tripe and meatballs in their pho as it is what the traditional pho is like  i know some westerners dont eat tripe but it should at least be an option for people who really want a taste of authentic vietnamese pho  they also need to increase the portion for the pho  overall its a good restaurant  i give it a 4 star  my only complaint is that the food tastes a bit too sweet 
its sad that women love the doctor so much here that the staff and there billing practices can be so bad  doctor huish  apparently  is really good   the billing which is currently third party is terrible  the office tells you just call us we will take care of you   if you are going to do your own billing a couple thoughts for you   1  set up a voice mail for billing  dont just tell us your closed and dont have time for you   2   have some people work later into the evening say 6 or 7 to take care of people who want to pay but work the same schedule as you   3   if you dont like customer  patients  or whatever than consider online bill pay its novel and requires no extra hours no overtime etc    very disappointed i suppose if doctor huish had to spend a half hour to an hour talking to a frustrated patient or client instead of making 300 dollars for a fifteen minute stop in he might make the changes    wish me luck going in with the wife tomorrow prepped for talking to people who wont care 
very helpful and attentive staff  answered all of my questions and tried to help me find the bike that was just right for me 
ive recently become the vaping queen  there is not a vape store that goes unpassed in my travels  i hope that my experiences help you make the best choices for all of your vaping needs   there are so many selections in juices   they have computer screens to help you decide which juice is right for you   you can try countless juices     this store is great  they have everything possible and it is easily accessible  the only downside is that you cannot independently try the juices  you have to work with one of the sales people  the clerk who helped me was a young kid  he was knowledgeable  but clearly disinterested  that is a strange experience for me to have in a vape store  as people are generally enthusiastic  but he was helpful and knew his stuff    definitely a place to go for a wide variety of choices 
ive recently become the vaping queen  there is not a vape store that goes unpassed in my travels  i hope that my experiences help you make the best choices for all of your vaping needs   fabulous selection of juices and equipment   helpful  friendly  and enthusiastic staff  robin helped me fix a problem i was having with my device  and made suggestions for how to improve my vaping experiences    the atmosphere is very laid back and relaxed  i felt right at home  like i could stay there for hours  which i did   they also offer a rewards program so you can earn free juices and equipment when you buy stuff   this store has three locations and the rewards program applies to all of them    definitely worth a visit or two   favorite flavors here  jazzy boba  doh nuts  wapari drops 
gorgeous atmosphere  delicious food  wonderful service  my friend and i both had new york steak with veggies and lobster tail and it was scrumptious  the cocktails could use a bit of work but they werent bad  just a bit basic    the vegetables were easily the best that i have had from a chain restaurant  great variety and well cooked  we also shared a fudge brownie for dessert  and i was planning on only having a bite since i was already stuffed  but it was fantastic so i kept on eating    highly recommend this restaurant for a date or special occasion 
this company was selected for us by our homeowners warranty when our water heater broke  needless to say  if we wanted to have any part of this service covered by our warranty  we had to use them   first of all  this company will not provide you with an itemized invoice  apparently  they do not want you to see what everything costs  this is something we requested because we were charged  900 in code upgrades that our warranty company said they would not cover  we happened to find out that  150 of this was just for the required permit  which is almost a 49  markup of the actual cost of a permit  this is something that i could have very easily applied for myself online  but the company would not let me  they told me they had to get the permit  so  based on that markup alone  i can only image how much else we were over charged for   also  the technicians were nice guys  but they thrashed the area where our water heater resides  they bent the recirculation water pipe  which they fixed  but had to punch out a large hole in our dry wall  there is also a bunch of missing plaster and paint on the built in pedestal that the water heater resides on  they did send out a guy  the next day  to come fix the hole in the dry wall  but he did not fix anything else   overall  it was a very disappointing experience    so far  were still waiting for them to schedule the inspection for the city permit  it remains to be seen if they completed all the work to code 
dinner is okay  afternoon tea is expensive and smaller than expected portions  7 99 i expect more than 4 small wings and fries   large variety of food though
i took my family here for charlottes restaurant week the other night to celebrate my dads birthday  there were 5 of us  let me just say  it was incredible  ive done the restaurant week thing before on numerous occasions and  its very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible  this was absolutely not the case here   being that it was restaurant week  there was a set menu for us to choose from  unfortunately  there was not a vegetarian option  my fiancee is vegetarian   however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved  the server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well  in addition  at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty  every interaction with the server was met with a smile  and whats more important  we never felt rushed  the server found out that it was my dads birthday  and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert  complementary     as for the food  i can say that this was without a doubt the best steak ive ever had  the filet was so tender and cooked perfectly  for some perspective  ive eaten at ruths chris  del friscos  and several other high end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high end country club  capital grille blew all of them out of the water    i truly cant say enough about our experience  my dad said that it was the best birthday hed had in a very long time  and attributed it to his experience at capital grille  if you are looking for a great place to eat  with great service  i cant recommend this place enough 
i was here about a month ago and it was certainly alright  i went with family for a grad night dinner  i had a pretty good eggplant parm while my grandmother had the butter squash ravioli i believe  my grandmother remarked it was a bit sweet for her and upon trying it  i thought it was tasty but on the sweet side to be sure  but speaking of which  the cheesecake was the dessert i ended up ordering  interestingly it came in a jar which i accepted as a neat  novel little thing  however the berries were more present than any other flavor in the dessert  i ended up getting lots of tart not so much rich creaminess you might expect from a cheesecake  service was good but i still wish the berries didnt end up taking over what was my final impression of the meal 
my second visit to vegas and we stayed at caesars palace  when we arrived  it took us over an hour to check in because the people at the counter took forever  when we finally got our room  we found out that there were already people staying there  their luggage was on the floor  imagine people walking into your hotel room and who knows if they take anything   youll never be able to find out who it is  so unorganized and dangerous  the people at the front desk upgraded us to another room  but it wasnt even the type of room we originally booked so they upgraded us to a third room  youre on your 3rd strike caesar   the view from our window was nice and i did like the bath tub  it was big enough to fit 2 people and it was a jacuzzi  which is very nice and relaxing after you walked all over the strip  the bathroom was a very nice size and very spacious  the sleeping area was clean   i wouldnt mind booking with caesars again  but there are so many hotels out there worth giving a try and im sure theyre more organized when it comes to booking our rooms 
my sister and i had a blast here  there were so many wax figures and we had the best time posing next to them all  there were plenty of people there  but everyone was cordial enough to move out of the frame when youre trying to take a picture  some figures had people standing in line so that they could take a picture    i recommend looking for ticket deals or discounts because it can be expensive  if youre the type that likes to be interactive and take pictures then youll spend quite a bit of time here  but if youre just going for a sight see then i definitely recommend finding it an interest soon because thats all there is   a lot of rooms filled with wax figures    its quite a sight  i enjoyed going  my sis and i had quite a few laughs with the photos we came up with  but i dont think i would go a second time  once you see it once  i wouldnt have the patience to see it a second time  take it all in while you can 
pretty typical gnc  friendly staff and they carry just about everything  this location was a little hard to find at first  but just know that its close to the safeway grocery store   if your not buying online then this is a great place to pick up health products  proteins  etc 
lots and lots of frames here  great frames with lots of variety  or you can also have them custom frame for you    this place is large and very professional  it doesnt feel at all mom and pop like lots of framing stores do    i definitely recommend this place for any framing you need to do 
i came in for a cleaning and because of some sensitivity  and i had a great experience   cleaning  the dental hygienist for the cleaning did a fantastic job  she was very gentle and nice  probably one of the best cleanings i have ever had    dr  moe  dr  moe looked at my teeth for the sensitivity and for an overall check  wow she was so thorough and nice  i am extremely happy how she communicated everything so nicely before going forward  she fixed the issue on a back molar and even did a quick cosmetic fix why she was in there with a tooth closer to the front  i am very impressed with dr  moe and highly recommend her    dental office  the dental office has absolutely beautiful views with floor to ceiling windows  its a great office and with such friendly staff    overall i was very impressed and would highly recommend 
i took my 14 month old son to fidgets for the first time about two weeks ago  ive returned twice since  im not sure who loves this place more  me or my son  lol   the facility is very clean  the owner is constantly walking around with wipes and cleaning up  there are a bunch of toys to play with  anywhere you turn  there is fun stuff  my son runs around for 2 hours straight without stopping  there is definitely no way to get bored here   for the parents  knowing my son is playing in a clean environment means a lot  i also like that i can be sitting down on a comfy couch provided   drinking coffee  only  2    and being able to see where my son is at all times  it is so nice to go and get a little break   drink some coffee   relax a little  while my kid is having a blast  it is a win win   lets be fair though  you cant just sit there the entire time  it is so fun that i love playing with my boy   another great thing is that you can purchase coffee   water   juices   and lots of different types of snacks for you and your children   must wear socks rule applies   no sick kids rule applies   i currently dont have anything bad to say about fidgets 
i ate here for my birthday today    i am black   the other two women in my party were also    noone else in the entire restaurant was black besides us  we noticed toward the end of the meal     if you have this same condition dont eat here   if you are of any other variety    the food was good   
great place to eat and have wings   no surprise  right next to the asu campus so many tailgaters nearby for the games   plan ahead to come here if you ever go on game day  also  ask for their happy hour specials 
ask for josh  this place is a stand out    fair prices  quality attire   large selection in suits  vests  shirts  ties and more  i have been here twice   the first time was great   the second time confirmed that this place is a solid find  they are super easy to work with   they have a tailor in house and quick turnaround times  yesterday i bought another 2 suits  navy   dark olive    they never cease to impress   cant say enough good things 
this place isnt the kind of drop in anytime place but my guy here is awesome and ive followed him from two other places to salon t  i like this salon the best    its intimate and because its by appt only it is not crawling with people  the prices are great  i havent met the owner tiffany yet but my stylist kenny is awesome  he works a lot with women too they love his work   check it out  i dont think the store hours are correct either 
3 18 13 visited this place for the first time today with my daughter  i found them on groupon  i ordered an iced mexican mocha  never heard of that drink and decided to try it out  it was pretty good  different  but good  i also ordered my daughter a mini chocolate pie  she liked it a lot  very cute place  i wish it was cozier inside though  very open  modern and artsy   its kind of tucked away around the corner but still easy to find  cant wait to try another drink next time  it is a nice change from starbucks  update 3 19 13 tried their version of the white chocolate mocha and it was awesome 
this review is for my most recent experience  i called ahead yesterday to make sure the new phone i wanted to pick up was available  i spoke to brittany she said they had it in stock  and told me to ask for her when i arrive  so i headed down on my way  on my way down i called at t to make sure i was eligible for an upgrade  and i was     upon arriving i asked for brittany  she helped me immediately and had the phone ready right away  everything was done and switched over within 15 minutes  i purchase a new phone about once a year  and this was the easiest and most pleasant phone buying experience ive had in a long time 
da best in america  where else can you proceed in a military right face  and side step to the cash register   without thinking to yourself    did i just order all of the delicious toppings for no added charge   hmmmmmmm  and to savor the idea of anticipation   as to the miniscule amount of time that has elapsed   before    we have liftoff houston   the gourmet pizza from fired pie is like the terminator stating         ill be back  after one trip to any fired pie evokes images in your rem sleep   of going back again   again  if fired pie evah has their pizzas flown to the u s s enterprise   our military will support them forevermore  it is a brave new world folks   try it   let us know   what ya tink       
i love buds  for years they worked on my old 60 galaxie when most other shops in town either didnt want to or didnt know how to do the work  these guys are real mechanics  not just a collection of 20 yr olds who only know how to plug your car into a computer to diagnose the problem  and most importantly  they dont run up the bill for extra time or unnecessary parts  my buddy just received a quote for a job of  175 from buds that another shop wanted to charge  800 for    bottom line  to me  auto shops are all about finding someone fair you can trust  for me  its these guys 
i had the opportunity to spend a week in las vegas i thought visiting this club would be a good experience  but i was wrong   the girls here hustle you for money  without having your consent  they give you a 30 second view of their boobs and sit on your lap to talk to you  and then charge you  120 00  truly this was a 2 minute time window   the czech blonde girl was the worst for this  and we complained to the manager   i was here with my wife  and we are pretty easy going  but this was in my opinion  situational robbery 
after 4 visits i decided to add my 3cents worth of review  having spent a considerable time in mexico i was very surprised to find a mexican restaurant that reminded me of the fantastic food i have had through out mexico  they actually have sopapillas  sp  on the menu    this place is worth a visit  it is a bit small but prices are reasonable and the food has always been excellent  a couple of things    they dont offer coffee    too authentic    the other is that the service has never been as good as the food  this recent visit was no different with our having to wait for a desert while the other was served   not good  reason given   cook was very busy    that doesnt cut it  it is a management problem more than a cook problem  thats why the 4 stars    i still recommend them over all the  multiple mexican restaurants i have visited in north phoenix   when you go look forward to stellar food   not stellar service  hopefully they will work on the management issues    i still look forward to visiting again 
3rd time here  they were very busy   9 am sat morning  so we waited about 15 minutes  after being rushed to a table that was still damp from being wiped down  i immediately noted that the silverware and glasses were horribly water spotted and dirty with fingerprints  the coffee mugs were far worse with sticky syrup and lipstick smudges  when the server finally showed up  i pointed it out  and she took our drink order and then hastily grabbed them and later came back with cleaner    glasses and mugs  the water glass smelled of the chemical used in the dishwasher  we werent ready to order  which appeared to irritate the server even more  she left and returned about 10 minutes later  which was simply way too long to wait   i ordered an advertised special and my wife ordered a standard menu item with some changes  when they arrived  i noted mine did not look like the advertised item and was missing some ingredients  i had to wait about 8 minutes before i could flag down our server  who had yet to come by to ask if everything was to our liking  when she did finally show up after waving at her  i asked if my order was supposed to include additional ingredients and she immediately left and brought back the missing part  no apology was given  nor was there any suggestion to replace with a fresh and warm meal or the offer to remove it from our ticket  however  she did blame it on the person who brought the meal out  i requested that she remove it from our ticket  which she did  there was never an apology given    the cashier asked rotely how our meal was but did not wait for  nor seemed interested in a reply  it is quite evident that the restaurant management and staff were unprepared for increased business  first day of the month   after a payday   and a direct mailer had been sent out    really   and every employee there  wait and kitchen  were poorly trained by management and ill prepared to handle the increased business properly and professionally   in my previous experiences  the food has been exceptional  prepared and served correctly  that is the reason for the two stars  if i were a first time customer  i would have given a one star rating        i hope they get their act together as i do like the quality of their food  we will see     
great place  massive portions  could split one order to 3 every time  great place to go after marathons    yum yum 
homemade wraps  well made wraps  it was for sure one of the best wrap ive had in toronto   ive only tried the wrap though  
in my opinion taggia deserves somewhere between 3 and 4 stars   so im rounding up from 3 5 to 4 stars   both the food and service somehow fell a little short of expectations despite the impression that they put forth a lot of effort     the menu is interesting with a mix of italian staples like pizzas and a diverse selection of seafood and pastas   we started off with some standard antipasto including prosciutto  salumi  olives  cheese  and marcona almonds   all were pretty good but nothing to write home about   however  the caponata  burrata spread over grilled bread was a nice way to start off a meal   my favorite dish is the pan seared sea scallops in brown butter with grapefruit and capers   with specials like hand made pastas we also tried the gnocchi with veal ragu and crab ravioli   the veal ragu sauce was hearty and stoodout more than the gnocchi but the flavor of the dish seemed to still lack something   it tasted something like your grandmother would make out in the countryside villa   the sweet corn crab ravioli was also so so and did not live up to expectations based upon the ingredients and description  ricotta cheese    sweet corn    wilted spinach    porcini butter   the scottish salmon was good and i would order again even if cooked a little more than to my liking         the dining room is fairly intimate and if you enjoy eating al fresco there is a great patio   while chef james and the service staff were very friendly and patient  there were inconsistencies throughout our experiences   food wise everything seemed really fresh and the quality of the ingredients high  however  the tastes and presentations seemed more like dinner party food rather than fine dining 
went back and overall had a better experience   better food and much better service   relieved to see some improvements and think that they will start to build some regular and return customers    will be back with others to experience good thai and  hope to see this place continue to pick up business 
pretty freakin good burgers and the beer selection is awesome   the setup  however  is not    order at the counter than go get a table and wait for the food to come out   1    by 1     by 1 more    and by the time the other person is done eating their food     maybe youll have yours in front of you   apparently this seems to be an issue with others and not sure it really makes good business sense 
it was great pizza    super fast service   my only complaint     its too quiet in there   needs to turn up tv or play some music    
i ordered from this place without issue in the past  but this last time has guaranteed i will never be coming back and you can thank your employee cynthia for that  i ordered roughly  50 worth of food and gave a decent tip in advance   first problem  after waiting until my lunch ended i called to cancel the order and was told the order already left so i could not cancel the order    second problem  the food came an hour after their delivery time stated    third problem  the food came missing the coconut flan and the spinach and cream cheese soup   at this point i was fed up and told the driver i will not accept this order  its late and missing items  i want to cancel it and have my money refunded  the driver david stated because of the delay and missing items i could get my refund  but hed leave the food anyway  i told him i did not want the food so he decided to leave it with security and i went back to work leaving the food with security   fourth problem  your employee cynthia has the audacity to say that there was only one missing item and that theyll refund the soup  but the flan is in the order and ill have to pay for the rest  so per cynthia i am to pay full price for an order that was an hour late and also pay for one item i never even got   i informed the eat 24 rep that the entire building is wired for audio and video and that security was willing to sign a statement on my behalf  i had to threatened to claim the charge as fraud and file a complaint with the bbb to get refunded  this isnt good customer service and cynthia should be fired 
clean  but the service is poor and unapologetic  and the rooms are overly complicated with technology and the equipment faulty   during my stay  the tv has gone dark on the entire hotel for several hours  my room control system has inexplicably rebooted itself several times  and my curtains refuse to close   im trying to get some sleep  but the electronics refuse to function and there is no manual override for me to simply slide the curtains to a close   to make matters worse  the  it department   who hold the power to my curtains and sleep  give me no eta as there are several other callers with similar issues ahead of me    unbelievable   stay at the wynn  aria and most other mgm properties are riddled with unpleasantries 
i have never left a review on yelp before but i was inspired to download the app just to warn people about this place  i wish i would have looked at reviews before i came here today  i used to make the drive from north scottsdale  all the way over to glendale just for this restaurant when i was 16 to lets say 20  i am now 30 and decided to mix things up with my girlfriend and try my favorite from when i was a kid  this place has gone down hill in a hurry  i laughed audibly out loud when i read the review previously written saying they think it changed hands  i had just done a google search on my phone to see if they sold out  the owner must have gotten a new manager or food provider  the food made me sick  i ordered whole wheat pasta with the reduced fat marinara and it came out like a bowl of soup  we tried the 4 50 portobello mushroom appetizer and that was like a hot sponge soaked in vinager  the bread is soggy and nasty  i was embarrassed to take my girlfriend here 
i cant believe i gave this place a 5 star rating in my last review  i had such a good experience before and now i will never return  tonight i took the wife here for dinner to see what dinner was like since lunch was a delight  i ordered the half rotiserre chicken with a side salad and green beans  i asked that my salad be made without goat cheese   i get my dish and see a half rotiserre chicken buried in field greens with a side of green beans  the food looked delicious on the plate  i start eating the chicken at first  and it is moist and flavorful  i then take a bite of some of the salad and buried deep under the layers of greens was the goat cheese  i unknowingly put a large portion in my mouth and almost threw up on spot  goat cheese does not do well with me  i gave up on my meal immediately at this  point and was left with the sour stomach feeling  i wasnt going to say anything  just really make a mental note that i wont be ordering salads if i go back  my wife decided to tell the waitress on her way to the bathroom what had happened  she approached me and said oh i guess they missed some  which to me either means the salads are premade and sitting out waiting to be served  or they put it on my freshly made salad and someone noticed and said you need to take that off  instead of just making a fresh salad  either way i find that practice unacceptable  we advised the manager on duty of what had happened  and i think he could have cared less  its that lack of care for the customer  and the idea of old salad being served that has dropped this place to 1 star in my opinion  i will never go back to this establishment 
not a bad little place if you are heading into a movie  it is a relatively healthy little arrangement for 1  10 the time as the more tastey finer dining of persian room right down the street  eat here if your in a hurry and persian room if you have all the time to really enjoy the experience 
beautiful back patio overlooking the golf course but food is mediocre at best  some decent appetizers but over priced for quality  try the bruchetta 
i love this mom   pop shop    amazing customer service  always a friendly face   never dissappoints  large variety beverages   doughnuts  i love their cereal ones   youve got to check them out  if you live in the area  and havent swung in youre missing out  
my girlfriend and i decided to ride our bikes down to coca cafe and get some breakfast  once we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait   a lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad  i guess i can see where they are coming from if youre a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down  the coca cafe is not this place and its really obvious  its a pretty small cafe and youre going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting  the owner  or at least what i thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there  this is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat  in a place as small as coca cafe you cant afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people  this might be considered  rude  to people but its born of necessity  the  customer is always right  mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize   anyway  with that out of the way  we were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets  i had the wild mushroom omelet  shiitake and portabello  with jarlsberg cheese  a side of grilled potatoes  and pumpernickel toast  my girlfriend had the tomato  feta  and pesto omelet  i got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious   after a little bit of a wait  see my earlier rant  we got our food which was amazing  the omelets were full and incredibly hardy  the mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them  the jarlsberg cheese was so mild that i forgot it was in there at first  you can choose from two different cheeses so next time i think ill try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle  the egg was cooked just right  a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else  nowhere in the omelet did i find raw yolk which i absolutely hate  the potatoes were cooked through and crispy on the outside  seasoned to perfection 
we have now dined here twice  once an early dinner  without our four year old  the other  a friday lunch with the kid   i really want to rate them higher  the atmosphere is eclectic and loved all the seating options  birds are loud  and noise can get overwhelming  if you are not prepared for a ruckus  dont sit close to them   service was a major disappointment  lunch was miserably slow  we ordered kids pizza  she loved it   cuban sandwich  hubby loved it  not a typical cuban it had pork belly  and a half french dip with chili  it was okay   i asked for the beer menu and waiter took it back without asking if i wanted a beer  i wanted help since im a wino and have no clue about the beer scene  unless its santan epicenter or fat tire  i know  ridiculous  thats why i was hoping for a suggestion  they lost the sale  i had water  then as lunch took over 30 minutes to prepare i was really wishing i had that beer    bathrooms could be a problem  only one toilet for the men and one for the ladies  ladies door would not close all the way and lock  it was a good thing no one needed to go while i was in there    dinner was better  hubby had fish and chips and i had fish tacos and a shot of tequila  nothing wrong with the food or drinks  service still a bit slow  we will be back  just hoping service improves 
this has got to be worst krispy kreme  the shift manager was yelling at customers because the top row of doughnuts were not for sale  and they had no others to sell  she also stated she  couldt put more doughnuts out  because the more i put out  the faster they will go   what     the coffee has always sucked here  and but dont bother asking for water  its chandler water straight from the tap  both restrooms were out of paper towels    i guess ill stick with the drive thru because eating in was not a pleasant experience 
this is a unique place  your first impression is  sketchy    type of place you would only go in with a recommendation or if you were local  im glad we got a recommendation because this was a good eat  i had the burrito norteno with green chilli  very good  shark and shrimp tacos for the rest of the table and it all looked good with good comments    this is a small place with only ten tables and a small bar  the service is quick despite obvious take out orders and a full dining room  salsa is homemade and presented in tupperware on an ice bar  with a ton of different choices    ambiance is interesting  true to its name     tip o the hat   coke served in glass bottles   wage of the finger   find a better presentation for your awesome salsas 
i love sushi is our go to restaurant for sushi  i have never had anything from there that wasnt great  the monkey roll is unique and very tasty  the service is good and no matter how busy they are  we always get right in  but most of the time  they are pretty busy  if you want to best sushi in henderson  check this place out 
great passion for the culinary business and rico is a great person   take dons photo off making the caesar salad   he doesnt know how to do it with the same passion  put him in the banquet room serving water    lol   
had the chicken teriyaki and after a few bites  i was pretty sure it was the pigeons from out side  lol jk but it was pretty bad  do not recommend 
just had the ricotta and it was pretty good  the lady who served my meal was extremely friendly but the woman who wrung me up seemed to be annoyed by my presence  dont think i will be coming back
loved the beers  i had a flight and it was really good loved the flat breads as well  the only thing i was not a super fan of was the inside i would have loved to have more bar seating  i felt like most of it was for the restaurant and we came for the beers so did not want to take up restaurant seating  other than that we loved the place  woudl  come back and in a neat location
very nice place  i had the omelet which i would say was rather dry and i could make better at home  but all the other  meals were really nice  we started with the spread plate to share and that was really nice  the girls had the egg benedict and jay had duck and it was also great  the iced teas were really tasty and the desert which i had the cheese cake was very good  i would  have liked more syrup but it was still really good   we went for sunday brunch and i would like to try dinner  make sure you make a reservation as it does tend to get busy
very nice people   they also helped me use a coupon they ha online to help bring the cost down  i needed some help in framing fast for a wedding gift and they came though  i am definitely a repeat customer
love it  chili is very good and the size great  they have amazing onion rings and the beer samplers are so tasty  so far all we have had is been very fresh and good pub food   jay had the bangers and mash and he liked them
the best bread  especially the sour dough in edinburgh  the rest of their treats are fabulous also  coffee is also nice    you can sit in for coffee and a cake  before going home with the other items you purchased  super    owner and staff are also welcoming  friendly and professional  great service  too 
i love the idea of baked cheesecake over instant made in the fridge  however  having tried these  i found the slices too big   i know   who would dislike that  well  it is mostly cheese   but one slice is way too much for one  but  above that  it just was disappointing in the flavour department  it is off the mark if compared to my homemade  and ones from the us or germany  for example  with improvements  it could be very good and a welcome place to come and shop for the convenience  unsure  if i will try again     
love this location so much  the staff are always very friendly even when i walk in looking like a zombie and ask for something off menu  they have great customer service here 
omg    best tacos in town     located in the barrio  where all good mexican food is made  this place knows how to make tacos     everything is made fresh and so delicious  joytaco and america tacos dont know tacos like kiss pollos   prices are right  food is made fresh and im sure glad i found this place  will be here a lot more and cant wait to bring the family 
luv this place     awesome place with awesome food    i wiill be a loyal and frequent customer      highly recommend this place    
service is hit or miss  have been to this place a hand full of times  received good service twice and bad service thee times  steak was good  chicken salad awe full  music was good  will not be going back  dont like russian roulette with eateries 
seating at japanese ramen joints are very similar  3    6 tables and a bar  and a waiting list that you write your name on and wait to be called  at good ramen places  a half hour to 45 minute wait is the norm  they arent places to linger  they are places to eat and leave   early on a saturday night  before the huge ces tradeshow  we hoped it would not have a line curling around the block as it did the year before during the trade show  with a little bit of parking  karma  we snagged a parking spot as someone else left  signed in and waited   we were fortunate  after 20 minutes  we were in  some ramen places do a complete  meal  with broth  meat  egg  veggies  etc  for about  15 monta does the  basic  with add ons that comes up to the same price  but that meant you could get what you extras you wanted  more meat  maybe another egg or an extra helping of corn or nori   i had the tonkatsu shoyo broth  pork bones and soy sauce  with extra charsui  fatty pork   stewed egg and nori  seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks  the huge pots of broth at a roiling boil  how they heated the bowls before using them  the finishing of the bowls   once they arrived  we slurped it down   like you are supposed to  before the ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed  excellent noodles  tasty   very tasty broth  fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little  custardy    very yum   definitely worth the usual wait   if we were to head back there again 
my name is christine and i am a 45 year old female  just completed the first week at red mountain on the rm3 program  i was unable to use appetite suppressants due to other health issues so i am doing this without a crutch  i considered my start day to be the day after loading since  in my opinion  eating like a pig for two days did not constitute a new diet change  it has been very difficult at times but after just one week i feel like i am adjusting to a new healthy life and getting used to eating this way after being overweight most of my life  i have tried many many diets and could never stick with any of them  it was often difficult to stay with diet plans after working hard for a week and only losing one or two pounds  right now i am very shocked  i started at 220 and weighed in today at 211 after 1 week  9 pounds  i do realize some of this may be water weight but i have never come even close to this on any other plan and it is very motivating  i was somewhat skeptical starting this plan even after seeing other clients results  often diet and exercise programs use atypical results to sell their program  i figured i would not be one of those people  i have never been one of those people who has been an outstanding achiever on any diet plan    or any achiever for that matter  i am just a regular person struggling with weight like so many others and i am so shocked that i lost this much weight in the first week  needless to say i am charging into the second week with great enthusiasm  cant wait to report when i am under 200 pounds  and again no phentermine used 
great service  friendly staff as always  never have any problems when coming to this store  will continue to bring my business here and tell others when needed 
in a vietnamese pho restaurant  the key things are to get quantity and quality at a good price  at pho an  you get one of those   quality   undeniably  the food is better than the average pho restaurant  it looks fresher and it tastes better  the egg quiche looks like it was recently made and not from three days ago  the beef briskets in pho soup are nice cuts  and so on   the quantity disappoints and the price is heftier than the average pho restaurant    a rice dish with pork chop is close to  12  and leaves one hungry  specialty drinks start at  5   based on food alone  this place rates 4 or 5 stars  but value wise it gets knocked down for quantity and price   overall  if you like pho  and money isnt a consideration  this is the place you want to eat at 
we were new to the area  decided to check this place out and it rocks  foods good and so is the service  ashley was our server was super friendly and fun and made us feel welcome  we will definitely be back 
one of the best buffets of all time  the food is always fresh  i like the omelet  egg bar  you can get scrambled with whatever he has  i get mine with onions   cheese   they usually have bacon   sausage as well as french toast    they also have a nice fresh fruit tray  cheese   crackers as well as some different breads  on the hot side they have a prime roast most of the time  with some other hot items as well    the desert bar is nice as well  the lemon cake is moist  flavorful and a nice way to cap off a great meal   most of the time they have chocolate covered strawberries     the staff are always nice and alert and friendly    the best  20 youll spend in a long time    dinner is also a excellent choice  i suggest the lamb chops 
i have dined here a couple times   i first took my wife there in late november for a birthday lunch after a trip the phx art museum  i had stopped by there previously to pick up some of the coconut cupcakes made by tammy coe also located in the same center   anyways  i tried the blt with avocado and some fresh fruit  very good  bacon is crispy and the sourdough is great     if your looking for a good small wine selection  check it out  i like they have some hard to find shiraz which normally retail for  20  30 bux elsewhere   the cupcakes are all very good   i like the red velvet and the coconut  
i am definitely coming back to this salon  both workers are very good at doing nails and seem very professional  even though the salon may seem dirty and dusty its still a good salon  and also this is an old salon as well so what do you expect  when i got a pedicure i loved it so much  the technicians there are very kind and their language is interesting  this has got to be one of my favorite salons so far 
judging yelp photos  i am a zombie and eat brains     does that mean i will starve at your place 
it was ok   my boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and soup  so at least theres that  i had the strawberries   cream french toast   it was pretty cold  id give it a second shot for the lunch fare  the location is nice and the decor was cute  the food was just nothing to write home about 
great newer yoga studio in mesa  like a few other people i discovered floating lotus via groupon  but even after my deal is up im sure ill come back  the studio itself is beautiful  steve is always super friendly whenever you check in and the instructors are wonderful  floating lotus is very welcoming and not at all pretentious like some other studios in the valley  i look forward to them growing and expanding their class schedule 
my visit to 10 spot in the beach was fantastic   best facial ive ever had  the customer service is simply incredible 
it is fairly inexpensive place to eat breakfast in vegas   i had breakfast and lunch at this restaurant    breakfast was decent and lunch was just ok   i have to admit that i am spoiled   having eaten smoked meat most of my life in montreal  schwartzs  smoke meat petes  lesters  snowden deli      stage deli just doesnt compare   it was an ok sandwich and the price was excellent   having lunch for around  10 in vegas is a bargain   i give it a 3 star because of their price and breakfast was decent     if you ever want a real melt in your mouth smoked meat  pastrami  sandwich  visit montreal   its even better than carnagie deli in manhattan 
fixed my boyfriends phone for cheap    even though he dropped it   broke it again  wish we lived closer    cuz we would be regular customers 
awesome park in the middle of town  big  open area for relaxing outdoors  trail  pond  workout stations  picnic areas  fishing  etc  clean   well maintained  two thumbs up 
good   cheap    just how i like my pizza   had a slice before the show   perfect for on the go   
if youre looking for somewhere to watch a game on tv    keep looking  walked in   right back out   very smokey  nothing special    prices werent worth toughing it out for 
stopped in for a drink one night  the atmosphere was good  it was decorated pretty cute   they had fire pits to sit next to outside  they had live music the night we went in there   which is always a plus  they also had late night happy hour specials    
if i could give this place 10 stars   i would  ive only lived in vegas for about a month   i dont think i can count how many times ive been here  the selection of nachos is out of this world   my favorite has to be the pulled pork   although i had chicken fried steak nachos for breakfast the other day  which were also phenomenal  you cant stop here without trying their white queso either  service is always great  we like the bartender erin   the server loui   they have several tvs that show games      often have drink specials too   be sure to catch the  15 pitchers of daddys margaritas during football   we will definitely be back  maybe tomorrow lol 
ceasars palace is the best  stayed here for three days for a seminar and my stay was a pleasant one  first the room i stayed in was located in the augustus tower which had a beautiful view of the swimming pool  the room had king bed along with couches   the restroom was a good size  had both shower and bathtub   the best thing of all is that ceasars palace has everything you need  from restaurants  shops  swimming pools to a great casino  you dont even have to leave   i know where ill be staying the next time im in vegas 
if you love amazing and one of a kind flavors of ice cream  and if you also love amazing macarons  then you will absolutely love this place  just do yourself a favor and get the cookie cup   you will be in sugar heaven  all 3 owners are incredibly cool too   so head on in there and go treat yourself to one of the tastiest treats in the valley  you will have no regrets  i promise you this my friends    oh yeah  and theres a homemade toasted marshmallow to top it all off  drops the mic and walks away 
i was in desperate need of a haircut  my hair was unruly  dry  brittle and just an absolute mess  vanessa reached out to me after i had sent a yelp message to the salon  we made an appointment and she was kind to confirm the day prior  that is a necessity for me since my schedule is booked up and need reminders   i got the salon and she directed me to their own little spot where there was another client  their place was nicely decorated and had a great vibe  vanessa asked me questions about my hair routine  what i use   and she responded to my questions as well  she told me everything she was doing to my hair as she was doing it  she didnt pull or damage my hair even further  she brought my hairs bounce and curls back  she showed me products for my hair but not once did she turn into a salesperson  that is appreciated  the next day she texted me and asked how my hair held up to the treatment  which was absolutely kind of her since no other hairdresser has ever done that  i definitely recommend this girl  going back to get my ends trimmed in some weeks for sure  glad to have found her  thank you vanessa  
edamame beans soaked in garlic  ginger  chili   bomb  
went here for a strong latte once and a yerba mate the other time  the big tattooed guy working there speaks spanish  possibly from spending lots of time in south america where yerba mate originates   hes very knowledgable about explaining the art of yerba mate to newbies   i enjoy the warm  peaceful  cosy environment and will be back again to relax and enjoy a hot bevy 
the dinner isnt great   just a lot of flash presentation  ie  decor of fake marble  plush purple chair coverings etc    looks impressively palatial from outside on bay street but as you get closer  it looks kind of tacky  i tried some leftover dim sum before so i think id be up for trying that another time 
this was a great joint to satisfy your vietnamese food cravings   everything is fresh and super tasty  i loved the pho with oxtail   you will not be disappointed 
this is for take out  we couldnt get reservation for time that we wanted so we ended up doing take out  the food was good and i assume it wouldve been better if eaten there  we got the chicken and waffle  pasta dish  and short rib  the short rib was memorable  it was soft and flavorful  the chicken and waffle was good but not amazing  the flavored watermelon  salty and spicy  was very interesting 
from the creators of french laundry  this wonderful restaurant sits atop the venetian hotel  we had breakfast  brunch here and i was floored by the exceptional attention to detail  the food was absolutely mouth watering and beautifully presented   i had a fruit and granola bowl with a side of yogurt  the fruit was perfectly ripe and sweet  the yogurt cool and thick  the granola came in a pretty little bouchon package   it was filled with more than enough for the fruit bowl   thats why they put it in a package for you to take the uneaten portion home   dont think i just ate that for breakfast   we are of course talking about a glutton here  then i had lox on baguette  possibly the best baguette ive ever had in my whole life  the crust was thin and crisp  crunchy  the center of the loaf was soft as clouds yet had a chewy bounce  the lox was delicious and the fixins were top notch   creamy and thick hot chocolate with a side of freshly squeezed orange juice  and i was ready for a full day of vegas adventures  equipped with leftover granola to snack on  
we went in for carwash oil change   been going here for 5 years no problems   today they spilled cleaner on our car seat   the carwash guy genuinely felt bad  and he directed us to the detail area   this is where things turned   the manager came over was being a real cocky jerk about the whole thing   after 15 minutes of waiting for him and bickering with him just decided to leave   due to a ten minute clean you have lost a long term customer for life   what a bunch of idiots   also  i will be getting the car seat detailed  and sending superstar the bill   if they choose not to pay it  i estiamte  80  ill just take them to small claims court   again  over a 10 minute clean of a car seat   hope it was worth it to you   i think when your organization has 145 reviews and only 2 starts you need to seriously consider how you are operating your business 
for sure one of the better mexican places in the valley  and a quaint little place 
we did an order for take out   easy to order and was ready very quick   price was right  it was the same price if we had lunch at fast food   i got the french fries and they were absolutely amazing   cooked and seasoned to perfection  best fries ive had in a long time   my wife got the onion rings  they are beer battered  i tried one and cooked great a little heavy on the beer flavor   i got the philly cheesesteak   the meat was tender and plentiful   it is the reason for 4 stars vs  5   the meat was a little unseasoned could use something even just salt   for sure adding it to the list of places we will go to on a regular rotation 
pro    like the ambient  it has its own character  also you can check weird puppet thing downstairs    live dj spinning and for the most part i enjoy the music  more of a lounge music    good food    good number of crowds especially over the weekend   i had seen different type of people here   mixed crowd which is great in my opinion    can be considered a romantic place for date  especially if you get to sit upstairs  just feel more private   cons    can be pricey
more of 3 5 than 4 stars but rounded it up  rating based on the type of reataurant this place fell into  def  not the kind of place you bring your date but good food for cheap price on west side 
used to be my go to place when i lived in the west side    pros  yummy food  i usually get chicken curry  lamb vindaloo and their garlic nan  not the best i have eaten but great if u live in the west side   large portion in my opinion   cons  place can get rly loud especially when they have large 10  something group  they can get rly expensive for 2 people over  40   neutral  staffs are ok  sometimes you get friendlier staff than others  could be improve 
updated   business reach out and actually trying to improve customer experience add 1 star  to neutral review  ill be willing to try this place again in the future        tried once out of curiosity  i asked the teenager behind the counter about one of yhe drink flavor  he cant explain what the flavor taste like  all he said was it sweeter than milk tea  got the drink come to find out it taste like extra sweet coconut  i hate coconut  i used to served boba  starbucks coffee back in hs  college year  its part of server job to be able to understand the taste of the beverage you are serving  even if you dont want to taste the food  drink you should be able to provide some description of the drink more than it is sweet especially when the name of the drink is ambiguous  its boba drink dude  its laced with tons of sugar  of course it will be sweet    2   small place  typical okay deco  nothing spectacular plus the experience i described above   i just dont view this place as 5 star place hence i used 4 star max for review 
small shop but great place to get japanese condiments etc for cooking  its not on the best location in town but this place is own by authetic japanese which in my book set me at ease    what i meant by that if you were to ask me whether i feel more comfortable buying groceries in a japanese store vs chinese store  i would say japanese right away  in my experience japanese people take pride on their store no matter how small their store is  there is exceptions of course but more often than not this is true  ive been to japan multiple times in the past to be able to say this   they make sure products on the shelf are fresh and have not expired  if you go to chinese owned store more often than not they dont care about this stuff  everything is fair game  dirty floor  expired food  blood on floor  etc   you should know what i meant  about chinese store especially if you are asian lol 
doh   this place is a no brainier for the best donuts in las vegas   the homer is a must for any simpons fan who loves donuts  great tasting and super creative creations wont disappoint as long as you get here early
this place is great   good food and fast service  especially for to go orders through uber eats  orders are always ready when you get there and delivery is quick  this is how a small restaurant should operate 
this was one of my favorite restaurants while working in pittsburgh   the decor is incredibly sexy and the food is delicious   i dont think we ordered one bad thing 
stopped shopping there a year ago  heinens in avon is our favorite  giant eagle should take some service lessons from them 
overpriced margarita in a small glass with very little tequila in it  downstairs bartenders less than friendly  i will have margaritas at a decent mexican restaurant 
food here is great   nice atmosphere and great service  affordable for a waldorf astoria resort 
i heard through the grapevine the sweet escape only sells macarons on saturdays and sundays  so i stopped in today late afternoon  saturday  to pick some up   the place was quite busy  with lots of people buying stuff to go or seated in the dining area   the staff were efficient and very nice  which was cool considering how busy it was    prices are  2 00 per macaron or  10 00 for 6 macarons   they had three flavours today  chocolate  salted caramel and coconut   id read from previous reviews that their macarons are  meh   so i was prepared for mediocrity   well  perhaps they kicked it up a notch with the recipe    because these macarons were a ok   they were crispy and airy  yet still moist in the centre   i could tell they were fresh   not overly sweet  and the flavours were distinct   if im ever there again during the weekend  id most likely stop in for some more   if you go for macarons only  like i did   make sure you go on the first day they sell them so that they taste their best   the other cookies and cupcakes on display looked interesting  too 
went for the 1st time with my friend who has recommended it   it was amazing   you walk in the place is beautiful  service was good and the food was soo good i had gotten then fried shrimp and mushroom pasta ill definitely be going here again 
the food was great  they really need to work on their service  one of the waitresses was kind of friendly but i felt like it was fake  the other waitress who was serving me was nice but did not greet me quickly   the people that came in five minutes after me had drinks and their food faster  my appetizer came out after the ramen  the guy behind the bar is very unfriendly and impersonal  borderline rude  he never smiled and it just looked like he didnt want to be there  i hope hes not the owner albeit he was pretty young  i wont be coming back and its unfortunate because i live less than a mile away  i want to feel welcomed when i dine out and i didnt feel that way tonight  i think the service will alienate other customers just like me and these guys will be out of business within the first 12 15 months depending on how many free months their landlord gave them  its too bad because the food was pretty good 
was very helpful   we had a session on finaces and preparing for future retirement   the consultent  coach encouraged me where needed  and gave good advice   please try out the services 
i love this place  it is the best nail salon yet  friendly staff and perfectionists  they wont let you leave unhappy and have a reward program as well  they really care about your happiness and health  i strongly recommend this place if you want an enjoyable time while getting a beautiful manicure
i never knew this place existed since theres no sign for it  just a long hallway  while my friends knew it existed and theyve had it  we decided to brave the long line and grab a few slices   it was past midnight on a saturday night and the line wasnt getting shorter as we stood in it  people were passing by us with either slices of pizza or a full on box with a whole pie in it    when you get to the front of the line  you kinda ignore the menu that they have and just point out the ones that you like  come to think of it  i think their menu just states the prices and some options but thats all i could remember  in any case  you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you  each slice is about  5  6  a little steep for a new york slice but i get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it  i opted for the pepperoni   sausage and a slice of just sausage  i had the sausage that night and it was goooood  they have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it  without it was still pretty delicious  the boyfriend had his the next day   we heated it up and it was still pretty good  but its definitely better if it was eaten the same day it was ordered    in any case  i would brave the line again and order their other options  its a pretty good slice of pizza 
so we all know that poke is the next big trend and las vegas already knew this   this place is located in a strip mall  like so many places in vegas  and at first it was hard to locate but their huge sign made up for it  the shop is organized by poke on the left and miscellaneous goods on the right   goods as in frozen saimin  cake mixes and etc  items that you can only find in some specialty stores    when we arrived  there was a small line  but the guys behind the counter move fast  there were several small batches of poke that you could choose from  there were also seaweed salad  kimchi cucumbers and other items that you can order if you dont want just poke    the boyfriend and i ordered half a pound of the garlic ahi poke with shoyu on the side and half a pound of spicy avocado ahi poke   both were delicious   the ahi was excellent and the flavors were on point  they did run out of the spicy avocado ahi poke but they readily replenished it  it seems as if they are always prepping and they prep small batches so that you get the freshest poke and its just not sitting there for quite some time    overall our group spent a pretty penny at this shop but it was well worth it  we would definitely go back again and again and again and again   you get the idea 
was not impressed   karaoke was more dancing than singing  the place was very smokey  the bartenders werent very friendly or personable  we had to chase them down and even then they werent trying to provide good service  i would not recommend this place  sorry  you failed to entertain 
heads up  came here for the reviews and it took longer than 30 mintues just for potateo tacos and fries  not a good experience for the first time  staff said they had calls to take care of  but what about the customers here     again not good experience 
my guy and i fell in love with this place  we went during the mariachi brunch on a sunday  we used a restaurant com certificate  so we had to spend a minimum of  50  which wasnt that hard  we ordered the sampler platter for the appetizer  everything was delicious  i loved the nachos and shrimp quesadilla  for entrees  we ordered the carne asada tacos and carne asada from the grill  all of the food was seasoned well and the portions were big  will return on my next trip to vegas 
this place gets a worse rep than it deserves  you should go into the stay knowing that you are not staying at the cosmo or wynn  you didnt pay the price for it  so why would you expect something similar   i checked in at about 10 am  the clerk was very friendly and even waived the resort fee because i was celebrating my birthday  my room was clean and it faced the luxor pyramid  it looked similar to an average holiday inn inside the rooms    as a first time gambler  i enjoyed the  5 minimums on the table games and the friendly dealers  i also visited the pool  i liked that there was an adult pool area  the main pool and connecting hot tub were filled with kids  the adult pool was nice because it wasnt too crowded and i ended up meeting great people to party with later on that night   if you are a cheap college student looking for a place to crash that is not sketchy  i recommend excalibur 
blueberry hill has turned into our go to breakfast spot when in vegas  nice family dining atmosphere with a variety of menu selections  generous portions and delicious food  personally love the oreo pancakes but ive also have had their omelets and crepes  you can tell the food has been prepared with pride in its presentation  ive  been here 3 times and service has been consistently attentive and never a wait to be seated 
my wife and i visited the black creek pioneer village  most of the buildings found here were relocated within 20 miles of the sight the sidewalks were mostly wooden boardwalks  at some of the buildings there were costumed interpreters who answered questions and told about the  time about 100 years ago the most interesting part was the exhibit on  young children sent to canada from england to live and grow up as servants until they were 18 years old 
over the years ive tried out several waxing salons and theyve ranged from cheap to luxurious  the women have usually been nice and professional  a full body wax usually takes me 2 2 5hrs  it usually hurts a lot as well since i have a lot of body hair  but discovering this place was like finding the answer to question id been asking my whole life  dolly is a gift  shes quick and through  im in and out of the place in 45 mins with less pain than ive usually experienced  the place is fairly reasonably priced as well especially for the service she provides  i cant stop talking about how awesome she is for at least a week after i get a wax from here  because the experience was simply so delightful  waxing sucks  but with dolly its tolerable 
i came here for a quick bite and a drink just before my flight back home   seemed like an ordinary american sports bar type of restaurant   it was nice out so we sat out on the patio area    i ordered the famous tortilla soup and a salad   http     www yelp com  biz_photos  steves greenhouse grill phoenix select 9syetybv84ceywliejzgsq cwviyksxmsxruhxay9g0jq    i dont know why the tortilla is called  famous    it was just an ordinary tortilla soup  kind of watery and lacking in chicken flavor    nothing spectacular but it wasnt bad   the salad was pretty plain  chopped iceberg lettuce   i also ordered a margarita   this tasted like it had a little too much margarita mix in it but it did the trick  p
this was my first time having tapas and i am definitely coming here again the next time im in vegas  not too pricey either  its good to go with some friends and order a bunch of plates to share  the shrimp and filet mignon skewers were to succulent  flavorful  and very well cooked   im salivating as i yelp  check this place out for sure 
i had 2 and a half hours to kill so im glad that the airport had a bar with draft beer   the food didnt look too great   the person next to me was eating tacos but it had a weird smell to it   like old meat   im glad i wasnt hungry   haha     i sat at the bar  which was pretty full and ordered a few draft stellas   the beer was good and the bartender was nice   he informed me that we are allowed to walk around with our beers in the airport terminal which was awesome   i had the bartender put my last beer in a plastic cup so i could walk around   each beer was about  9  kinda pricey but its an airport so i wasnt trippin 
i finally got over to forequarter last night and was very impressed   we came around 8 45 and had to wait twenty minutes for a party of 6  which isnt bad at all  the place is small and we were put in the dark as night back hall with the bathrooms to wait which was kind of weird  but they took our drink orders from there instead of us having to go to the bar which was good    the place itself reminds me of an upscale tavern or something  maybe a speakeasy  its dimly lit and sort of minimalist but very comfortable    once we were seated the service was very good  our food came out quickly and our waitress was really nice and not pretentious at all  they dont split checks as a policy  which a lot of servers at upscale restaurants have even told me is the most bogus thing ever  but she was willing to put different amounts on each of our cards so that was helpful   the food was fantastic  i got the fried poussin which was tender  flavorful and went perfectly with the polenta it was served with  others got the steak which they loved and the pork belly  a few complained that the portions were a little small  but nobody didnt love what they ate   i also ordered the elderflower cocktail  it was pretty tasty but wasnt that unique  not quite at the level of say tornado rooms cocktails  but they had some good interesting other options    i cant wait to go back and try something new from the constantly evolving menu  hoping the next experience brings it up to 5 stars as its pretty darn close 
im really glad i made the drive to sun praire for both the experience and the food at chicken lips   definitely divey   it looks like a house and is surrounded by farms  its a bar with jukeboxes  games and dim lighting  no frills whatsoever  it seems like a place where sp locals come to hang out    we walked in and everyone was super friendly  the bartender helped us decided what to order  we ended up getting the original and the dry rub wings  the chips and the cheese curds  the chips and cheese curds came out first and were great appetizers  they are coated in the same rub as the chicken  so even though the actual curds and chips werent the best ive tried  in terms of texture  factors besides seasoning   they were definitely tasty  then the wings came and they were super yummy  i couldnt decide if i liked the original  saucy  kind of like buffalo wings  or the dry rub better so i had plenty of both  they went great with their original bleu cheese  apparently diluted with sour cream  or something    which apparently  mama  invented because bleu cheese was too expensive    im glad i went  but im not sure i agree that these are the best wings ever or even the best wings in town  regardless  the food is very good and the experience is a hoot 
finally made it over to karben4 for sunday brunch and it was worth the drive   everything on the small menu sounds amazing and everything me or my companions ordered rocked   i got the monte cristo  which was fabulous  the french toast was perfect and the ham was good quality  the egg was a perfect amount of runny    they offer a combination platter  cant remember the name  that also comes in a half sized version  the tiny tim  dont be fooled by  half sized    it comes with so much food and is a steal  you get the pulled pork sandwich  ham  greens and french toast with a fruit compote  its about the same price as if you just ordered the pulled pork sandwich  very good  by the way  by itself    friends ordered their special mimosa  which is juice mixed with their ipa  not a fan of ipas myself but my pals really enjoyed this 
i went back to gotham craving a bagel  forgetting my past disappointments  i was more disappointed than ever   the food is just not good  the ham  trying to be fancy  is so disgustingly salty and does not belong on an egg and cheese sandwich  the sausage is also some weird patty and not a normal sausage patty youd have on a breakfast sandwich   gotham says its a ny style bagel shop but misses the mark when it tries too hard  the bagels are great but your egg sandwiches are almost inedible  my friend and i both picked at ours and didnt finish     the wait for the food is far too long  its overpriced and nobody smiles 
this place has delicious and well priced food  everything ive ordered tastes so so so so good   i personally like the homey feel to the restaurant  super casual and no frills  but not divey either  it gives me a very warm feeling   i highly recommend the french dip and the cheese curds  which are competitive with some of madisons top rated restaurants 
finally got to try bradburys today  the staff was really friendly in helping me decide what to order  because obviously everything looked awesome    i started with a chocolate raspberry muffin and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice  both were great  my companion ordered a latte which he thought was good  not amazing  then we waited for our crepes  and waited  and waited  i know the place is small  but it wasnt that busy and we did wait for about 45 minutes   but then the food came and it was basically worth it  decadent  interesting combinations of flavors  the sea salt  honey and butter crepe was brilliant and only a few dollars  the creme anglaise and raspberry crepe was great and actually had enough fresh berries to have some in each bite  definitely would not be true at a lot of restaurants    i definitely want to come back and try more crepes and would recommend it to others but only if you have a lot of time and arent starving  its a fun cafe atmosphere to come with a friend  sit and chat 
this is hipster heaven central for hipster cabbage town   no bullshit coffee served here   i dont know how its there now but back in the days  it was a great place to hang out for a bit and shoot the shit and have a cup of coffee   a lot of bike couriers hung out here back then   it was smaller   they have now opened up the ceiling more and the place looks bigger   the downstairs washrooms are still the same   kind of nasty but whatever    just do your thing and begone with you   nothing much to eat although jet fuel used to make muffins and they were great   justin used to make them   i really miss the old jet fuel   still a great place for a latte or coffee 
havent been in a while   last time we ate there we all got sick from what we believe was old chili    friends and family have been and all of them complain of poor service   i would suggest another spot for a quick bite 
my wife and i went for a sunday lunch  once we got seated  got our drinks quick  we ordered burgers for lunch  wife got fries and a salad with hers and i got onion rings  both burgers came with bacon    once the food arrived i tasted the bacon to see if i wanted it on my burger  for the first time in many years i actually had to spit out the most disgusting bacon i have ever tasted  when i questioned the waitress on the bacon  she said it may be the olive oil the use to cook it  who cooks bacon with olive oil  or rancid olive oil  we both ordered medium cooked burgers  both hockey puck patties came more than well done  very dry and flavorless  we could tell the fries and onion rings were frozen and not fresh  having to pay extra for a side salad u would expect some substance  instead u get a pathetic helping of sliced iceberg with tomatoe and some mushroom slices  im a big guy and my wife is pregnant  so were usually ones to clean our plates  not today  we left with pleanty left over and didnt want any of it for later  my wife and i got home  and both of us within a few hours got diarhea   its a shame that such a new restaraunt has already chosen to skimp on quality and flavor in an economy where consumers are willing to pay more when they know something is worth it    the only reason i gave 2 stars is because they compd our appetizer and our waitress was nice  im no expert  but this place doesnt stand a chance if they dont switch to fresh meat and products  i hope they do change their ways because this place has potential 
some of the best customer service ever received in over thirty years of buying comics at a direct store   they always have stock of what i want  and regular sales throughout the year 
i came to kimlong last night  i ordered 2 beef noodle soups with meat ball  it was very bad  i will never come back again    
if you want to deal with uneducated and unprofessional loan officers  wait three months for your loan to close  miss your closing date  loose the house of your dreams and pay  2000 in originations charges  stop looking this is definitely your mortgage broker 
i came here about a year ago but i still remember the great potato and leek soup  the real reason to come here was because i am a big harry potter fan  but the food actually was not so so as most reviews point out  i noticed that soups  besides tomato soups  at a cafe are usually too salty but this was different  soup was perfect and the potatoes were mushy at just the right amount  plus the leeks werent  stringy  staff was pretty good as staff goes  and though they werent noticeably nice they werent noticeably mean either  it is a great cafe and i hope ill be going back 
this place has delicious  no fuss  homemade swabian food  the walls and ceiling had some beautiful wood paneling and antique paintings  i joked to my husband that it looked like the kind of place that you would go to after a day of hunting  we arrive around 5 45 because we didnt have a reservation and were surprised to be the only ones there  we thought that was odd for a place with such great ratings  well  that changed quickly as within 10 minutes the entire place was full  it felt like being in the middle of a family reunion as the customers and staff seemed to greet each other like they were old friends  that was a key indicator that the food was good  if the locals know the place well it must be great  the entree menu had about 10 plates to choose from which made it easy to narrow down  we ordered the pepper steak and the butter schnitzel  the brown sauce on both was amazing and the beef was perfectly cooked  the fried scalloped potatoes were really nice and crispy  we also had some fresh green salad and potato salad that was very good  even my husband liked the potato salad and he hates them  service was friendly although not very attentive  the restaurant was pretty full though so maybe that was the reason  we will be coming back to try so more dishes 
love love love my hair color  i normally dont like change  kinda always had the same hair cut and my natural hair color    decided its time for a change after 25 years of boring same look  we decided on different tones of color to make my facial features glow  at first we did more of red tones  with light brown  it was nice and a subtle change    i wanted something more after three months  so went back and he suggested maybe going lighter  i didnt want to completely lose my red  and wanted it to pop here and there  so he added two more tones  much lighter    i received so many compliments  my friends and family love it    getting hair trims every 3 months and my hair started growing so fast  i was always afraid to get cuts and he understood i wanted long hair and so a trim was necessary to achieve healthy looking hair and fast growth  most places i have been in the past  they would never just give me a trim  it was an actual cut and i would have to wait so long for my hair to grow out again  so frustrated   next i would like to try hair extensions  supposed to last up to six months    
we planned my parents surprise 60th birthday party at grays and couldnt have been happier with how the evening turned out  nicki is a big help in planning  estimating food portions and offering suggestions for drink packages  the space itself is great  very wide open for guests to socialize  sit and eat  drink  because it was a surprise the staircase led to a great way to have all guests stand to shout surprise as my parents entered grays  the staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout the whole night  id highly recommend grays to host parties  
one of the well known resorts on the strip  its a beautiful place  but my biggest problem was  no one knew where the venus gardens were  we went here for my friends wedding  and we were directed up and down the the entire resort  no lie  it was cool to actually meet up with some of the other people that were part of the wedding party as well  we thought we were at the right location  until the groom calls and tells us  to go back to the front of the resort as thats where its taking place  so  minus one star for the people that work here that dont even know where to tell us to go  i do give them a b for the effort  one lady who was nicely dressed  actually walked around with us for a little bit and tried her best to make sure we found our way    well  we finally arrive and it was a beautiful day  evening for the nuptials to take place  the gathering of friends  family  and seeing the smiles on the faces of the onlookers  what a great way to end such a stressful run through the casino to be here for this  congrats again mr  and mrs  goose  i love you both 
everything you would expect from a high end steakhouse at the wynn with  his  name on it  after several visits over the years i can honestly say this is the one steakhouse in vegas that delivers perfection every time  food is just outstanding  wine selection excellent  service remarkable and the little extra touches make the experience special  one of my favorite places in the country 
live lolas louisiana kitchen  great place for a lunch date with amazing louisiana dishes on the menu  the baked oysters are magnificent  and the gumbo truly done right  love the atmosphere of the place too 
still a favorite amongst vegas locals  del friscos is always a great place to dine  great bar to start the evening off with a cocktail  the seafood platter is just beautiful  steaks and sides are excellent  service level has really dropped over the years   most of the waiters and bus boys are not trained properly so dont expect 5 star service  the patio is a favorite place to end the night with a cigar 
tucked away in a strip mall where you least expect an authentic french bakery to be  its nice to see a true parisian experience here in vegas  the baked bread is the best youll find in town  the croissants and pastries are exactly the right look and taste  and their quiche florentine is the bomb  well be back regularly  nice atmosphere  very laid back  and the coffee is actually good   tips     the pistacchio bread is ridiculous      pate sandwich is excellent  ask them to butter the bread for perfection
the thin crust pizza here is outstanding and so is the pasta  a great spot for a conversational dinner or pizza to go  love the eggplant pizza
overrated  poor service  overpriced and a zoo atmosphere  that was our experience when we brought out of town friends to sushisamba for a dinner for four  food was very good as youd expect  but the experience makes this place a  keep off  location  i took the waiter aside to plead with him as a local to treat my out of town guests with more care and attention   he didnt bring one of the four drinks we ordered  forgot 2 of the appetizers we ordered  and didnt bring the bottled water we ordered twice   high expectations quickly became a disappointing experience  will never return to what is nothing more than a tourist trap   
the best dimsum for az standards   lots of hot dishes and the carts come around often so you dont wait too long for your cravings to be met   the staff are friendly and eager to get you full 
come thirsty yall   tons of draft beer to choose from and if beer aint your thing they have a handful of wine on tap as well   but flights of beer is their signature order    unfortunately the 10  pizza we had was bland but youre coming here for beer which will not disappoint 
great coffee joint but the americano was a bit too acidic   lots of people were ordering some baked goods as well  will have to try that next time    just ordered the ice coffee  much better than the americano  less acidic 
awesome snowflake dessert   this is a very cute cafe with cool technology dessert   if you havent tried the snowflakes you def have to come and check it out   the owner is passionate about his creations so def seek his recommendations 
the prices and portions are great   the food is as good as it gets in metropolitan phoenix   the staff are very friendly but its def a dive 
came out for lunch and looks as though the fried fish were their signature dishes or the typical bar food   they have guinness on tap  enough said   they have a huge patio at the back and full bar 
i personally  think there is far too much icing   however  everyone else i know looooves that fact   great prices  creative flavors  and a nice  wide variety   love main street 
pretty good and authentic irish food and pretty well priced
another yelp treasure  how else could i have known about this great company  brent was great  helped schedule a quick appointment  tile and carpet needed to be cleaned for sale of my home  great job  they did come back once for a touchup but it was painless and very much appreciated  i would recommend them in a second 
im sad right now  i wanted to like this place so badly  i wanted to have the positive experience others did and be able to happily write about it on yelp  hubby and i went last weekend  got all dressed up  left the kids at home and took the date car  people watching was great  service was great  even our table location was great  the bar area was great  i loved the atmosphere  did not mind it being dark at all because it was so cool inside   what was not great  pretzel bread was a little stale but butter  lots of it  helped  the seafood tower was impressive  but the seafood adorning it was not so much  the clear lobster roll was outright inedible  mushy  no flavor  disappointing  my mambo salad was passable but nothing great   when i asked for shrimp on top  after hearing so many great reviews about the shrimp  they gladly obliged  but when it came  they were overcooked and rubbery  wah for me  husbands steak was very good  he was gloating for sure   we got two sides  the crab truffle gnocchi and the peas  the gnocchi was decent but i really could only have a couple of bites due to the intense richness with nothing to offset it  the peas  while super fresh  were swimming in oil  seriously  they took great peas and drowned them to death in a sad  sad oil lake   the butter cake was superb  nothing but fond memories of that   so  we spent a small fortune for a meal with one  for me  or two  for hubby  great points   i will not be going back  i will not be recommending  we live in mesa  and were the first of our circle of influence to go and i am devastated to be the one steering people away due to such a lackluster first showing   i wonder what went wrong  so many other yelpers just love this place 
dr  reynolds is seriously the bomb dot com     i recently lost over 100 pounds and so i have saggy extra skin just chillin all over the place  he did my breast lift and tummy tuck and ill be going back in a couple months for my legs and butt lift  he made me feel incredibly comfortable and i knew right away i could trust him  i was scared out of my mind  but it was easy to have complete confidence in him  and im healing sooooo good  definitely worth every single penny  p s his office staff is actually nice  thats hard to find nowadays   
foods om  staff needs some work  walked in after i called in my order to find two girls standing there talking  with no one in the restaraunt and they didnt even start my order  also table were dirty with plates  again  not busy at all  things would be different if i was manager 
incredibly delicious food  my only complaint is the restroom which is downstairs  the way down is very steep and the floor is very slippery so it feels kinda dangerous to go there 
great place   was only in madison for a couple of days but wanted a pedicure and really happy that i chose here  very clean and professional  environment     ill be back in june 
ive stayed at the edgewater hotel before and its definitely a great hotel  they should disassociate themselves from this restaurant though    i ordered the lobster roll with french fries   the french fries were the star  and they werent even that great   this lobster roll was the most bland  tasteless  season less  flavorless food i have ever tasted in my life  it was unreal and extremely disappointing   in other news  the waitress was very friendly and attentive   but i was too shocked by the quality of the food to get her name 
danielle was the greatest her customer service was great  the food was good i will be back for the service
yuck   for a place this crowded  i had thought it would be better   we got one of the negro nitron beers   sour and unappealing   then we tried a gordo stout  hoping it might be somewhat guiness like in nature   this too was sour   finally  i went with an old standby  mr  pineapple  which i normally like   i dont know if this was a bad batch or what  but all i could taste was fermented orange juice   the margharita pizza had way too much cheese     instead of being light and delicate it was heavy and too filling  the pretzels were amazing  but not amazing enough to give it a higher rating   the other completely annoying thing is that they have way too many chairs and tables crammed into that space   the wait staff and the customers cannot walk through without bumping seated patrons constantly or knocking womens purses off the backs of their chairs   all around disappointing   wont be back 
the family loves this place   we stop in for shakes after a good solid workout at sitan gym  which is next door   the strawberry banana shakes or the peach mango shakes are the bomb   there are all kinds of add ins that are reasonably priced  and the shakes are reasonably priced too   you  could go to mcdonalds and spend 6 00 on food thats totally unhealthy  but id rather spend that 6 00 on a great shake and put good quality things in my body   the staff seems knowledgeable and always friendly   they have a selection of cold drinks too near the front   my kids love to grab a gatorade after a workout   great place 
i like this location and i find the team there inviting and friendly   i ordered my drink and the young lady brought it to my table   the only thing that prevents me form giving it a 5 star rating is the wifi set up   you have to ask for a login and code   they should do what starbucks does  you must agree to terms and conditions   but that is the only negative for this location  and in the great scheme of things it is minute  i go here when ever i am on this side of town 
im surprised this starbucks is the worst one ive been to considering its located in such a nice location   service was horrendous and drinks were gross 
currently under construction and a definite tourist spot   its crowded and over priced  but the taste of the m ms are so much better than the ones in the packages that they sell at the store   the ones they sell sometimes taste like paper  at least to me anyway   these taste fresh and chocolatey 
miscommunication  jobs taking much longer than discussed therefore costing more  ending up with jobs half completed  i now have to hire someone else to re paint a wall and sand down patched holes and reprint them as well  i wish i had have done more research  i had a discussing with lesley at fix it before the last day of work and after expressing my dissatisfaction about how people were coming unprepared and had no clue what they were supposed to be doing so therefore not doing it  i was promised all of the last things that had to be done would take two hours  no surprises  all the unfinished jobs were discussed   four and a half hours later  im left with the task of having to hire someone else to fix jobs already paid way too much for  unfinished  beyond frustrated   id advise people to hire another company that charges per job not hour  dont make my mistake   
very good  had the corned beef and mash  waitress was fast and super friendly  will definitely return 
better than the strip    stopped in for lunch and ordered 3 street tacos had the chili verde  lamb and pasture and all were great and tasty well seasoned but adding the salsas was even better   salsas all great and fresh  cannot wait to go back for dinner 
i read the other reviews about golden nugget after i had already paid for my rooms   i was pleasantly pleased to find everything just fine there   rooms was large  clean   no problems   we had 3 rooms   only 1 had to ask to have it changed   thats because it was next to a noisy elevator    both check in   check out was very pleasant  had a great weekend    will def go back  
the only thing i dont like  is when you apply online for credit   the sales guys calls you up  like really    i went down and talked to them already and i just wanted to see if i could apply online without them talking to me  because i already talked to them at the store  but at that time i didnt want to feel like i was pressured into buying something right there and now   so i figured applying online and see what kind of credit i can get  so that way i feel like i can take my time on choosing the product i like within my range of credit   if i knew applying online would have them call me then i would not even try to apply online  defeats the purpose on telling everyone apply online  but will call you anyways      
pretty darn good pastries and a good menu to back it up  truly a cafe  coffee and croissant  check  omelette and coffee  check  high end french cake for a fancy or special event  check 
hmmm  i dont know what really to say about this place   although its sit down dining  it kind of feels like a fast food joint   not very comfy or inviting   definitely not very lively   the service was okay  not great or even particularly good   staff seemed young and indifferent   the food was okay  but all things considered  probably overpriced   i ordered veggie fajitas and they were nothing like id expected   the taste was good  but the veggies were soggy   when i think of fajitas  i think sauteed bell peppers and onions and mushrooms hot hot hot off the skillet   what they brought was more liked steamed zucchini and summer squash   super messy because the juice ran all down my arms no matter what i tried to do to prevent it   i just really was unimpressed with this place so we probably wont be going back again  but the food was decent   wish i could say better things  i just cant 
went here for new years winter wonderland rooftop party   loved it   ohmygoodlord it was cold  but at least they had space heaters scattered around   everything was done up so snazzy  white lights all around  dj spinning a good mix of popular music  beautiful people everywhere   i actually liked that they limited how many got in because although it was plenty crowded  it wasnt to the point where you couldnt move or breathe   they had free appetizers out most of the night  and it all was delicious   just before midnight  they came around with champagne for toasting  and  snow  fell from the sky as we rang in the new year   what a fun time   if it werent for the chill  this would have been my favorite new years venue in a long time   whod have thought downtown phoenix could be so cool  
beautiful ambience and decor  which is the main appeal   the waiter provided only prix fix menus  3 courses   when we asked why  he removed these and  reluctantly   gave us a la carte menus  not all of us wanted 3 courses  the crab cake was good but the salad garnish was oil soaked  the chickpea tajine was dry and surprisingly bland   the chicken peri peri was only moderately spicy  and came with mashed potatoes  desserts looked good  while the waiters were less than enthusiastic  the belly dancer was delightful and charming 
nothing spicy or adventurous   just home cooked food served at a very leisurely pace   you can bring your own wine  reasonable corkage  and will want to do that if you are looking for some choices  i would love to see the owners invest in refreshing the decor  because this is an excellent concept   unpretentious dining in a house converted to resto with a very pleasant host 
atmosphere  very busy and loud restaurant  good environment for a group of friends to chat  it would be too loud for a quiet date or catch up  the decorations and lighting was very bright  they have booths and open areas    food  many friends have recommended me to come here for their toast dessert  warning  to order the dessert you need to wait 30 minutes for them to make it  the dessert toast  was deep fried  more toast than there was ice cream and whip cream leaving it to be very bready  ive order the mango one before and that one was my favorite  it had many real mango chunks  this dessert can be shared amongst 4 people to finish  it would be difficult to finish with one person as it is very sweet and filling    as for the main meals they have a japanese fusion of foods  they had ramen which wasnt bad but not great  i would definitely recommend trying the omelette egg with fried rice in the inside 
i live no where near this place   have gone out of my way to eat there many times  i havent been since it moved  bc i had no idea where they went  but it looks like its bigger so thats great  i even made it a point to take an out of town friend here  i dont know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel  in a good way   it can get really busy at lunch  so i dont recommend it for a lunch break from work  i did that once  and got in and out just fine  but its a lot more fun without the time crunch  everything is delicious  but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must 
i called on the spur of the moment regarding eyelash extensions and was able to come right over   i saw gina and she explained the procedure to me   i was nervous at first but  gina is so knowledgable and confident that i relaxed in no time   1 hour later i have beautiful lashes    i highly recommend this shop and will return soon for more 
i had dinner at this place last friday  the ratings for this place made me hesitate but i took the chance  the place has great ambiance  right portion size  good tasting fresh food   ample parking  we tried the lobster item    f  the flan dessert was excellent   the approach to this place is the tricky part  watch out for sign once you enter the complex from mayfield rd 
heard a lot of this place for buffet but disappointed  may be because of comparing with other buffet in us  found silverware not clean and short of spoons  a place to visit once not often 
where to begin   so many problems with this place  from mouse droppings on the floor to cockroaches scurrying around and a hair in the salad and grease on the menus  needless to say we had to leave  didnt wait around to see what might be in the entree  gross 
time and time again i come home from mcdonalds on royalton with the wrong or missing items  how hard can it be   so disgusted with that place  
i have the worst luck with my phones it seems like  i got my phone and my dads phone fixed at the gilbert location earlier in the year and was blown away by the quality and the short turnaround time  i thought that it was just a lucky day for me  but no i came in about  a month ago to get my phone screen fixed and the phone was like new in no time  i have recommended almost a dozen people to get their phones and computers fixed here and they all told me they loved the service  greg is great there  i dont know what i would do without him and ubreakifix 
ive stayed here over the last 5 years i think and its gone from being nice and sane in a world of madness  to just a touch shabby   i used to love it because compared to the rubbish hotels in vegas  this was a bit of an escape  sanity  calm  no big casino  no clubs etc  i love all that   but not in the hotel  the walk to the strip was short and you know  the beds were fantastic   now though  its just completely been eclipsed  the wynn  cosmopolitan and all the other newer hotels just dazzle and shine and the poor old westin is  as someone else said  like putting lipstick on a pig    the areas around it remain sketchy and undeveloped  the views are rubbish  the spa isnt great  the service is just ok  the tv  per the pics  is from the 80s i think    i come away thinking that im in the cheap seats and thats unfortunately not the truth either    at  180   a stupid resort fee  its a bit of a con   and as a starwood platinum for many years    spg you should know better  please refresh and update or call it a pig 
i have been trying  unsuccessfully to obtain a mask cushion for my cpap machine since early june  i explained during each of the eight phone calls i made to the apria call center that i have two homes  one in tucson  az  and one in clio  ca  i explained that i had moved from my home in tucson to my home in clio for the summer and wanted to have the cushion sent to my clio home  starting in september i was told that i could not receive any supplies since i had been sent supplies in july  i again made several calls  and spent most of my time on hold and frequently transferred from person to person and then back to the first place  i called my insurance company  and their representative called on my behalf and was put on hold three times by three different people over an hour and a half  and at the conclusion was told the system was down  and he would need to call back tomorrow  he gave up  starting in october  every other day i received robo calls demanding i pay my outstanding account balance  i had never received the supplies  nor had i received a bill  when i arrived in tucson on saturday  i found my supplies had been delivered here  and in the mail was a bill for  39 93 with a due date of 10  14  17  the envelope containing the bill had a forward label from my clio post office dated 10  17  17  i would strongly recommend that if you need medical supplies you go elsewhere 
i was in town for a wedding   decided to stop by solid since it was nearby  the receptionist was hardly attentive  and i waited upwards of 10 minutes to be seated at a clean station  there were 4 empty stations  and i was the only person waiting   apparently its more important to have a place for the staffs morning coffee than a place for the paying customer  i asked for a french manicure   the tech refused to use the polishes i chose  instead using an extremely old looking bottle of white polish and something akin to acetone  i think   the manicure itself was poorly done  uneven  bubbles in the polish  generally sloppy  and literally washed off in the shower two days later  poor service  poor staff  poorly kept salon  and way overpriced    i pay  15 for a premium manicure in chicago that lasts at least a week  so the  22 for the absolute worst manicure ive ever gotten  from a tiny little suburban nail salon mind you  is absolutely absurd  do not go here 
i already knew going in that fondue is something you dont rush through  so i expected the dinner to take time  although the restaurant was busy  and i only saw two servers  they managed to keep our drinks full and provided excellent food  i brought some friends who hadnt ever tried fondue before  despite the wait to be seated and the time it took the food to come out  we had a great time and they were won over by the flavor and quality of the experience  nicely done 
had a horrible service from this location  i work within the mall so cheesecake is the only real food place to get food  we have their menu in our store and we order all the time  i called 30 mins before my lunch to make sure my order was good to go as always  i placed an order of fried calamari  good to go  i went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing  no sign of my order being there  i couldnt have called the wrong location because its the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time  the staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience  so i still paid and tried to wait for my food but still took almost 20 minutes where the at the time did not seem to be busy at all  they said that it was coming right up and i waited it was almost time for me to clock back in when i got my food to go and it looked really half assed  the amount of food i got was about half of what i would usually get and they had a soggy piece of napkin underneath the food  it was not fresh  it was not even remotely warm  i was not happy with the experience and staff did not try to do much to help out the situation 
i have been coming here for almost 3 years now  i use pubic transit and live in central phoenix and never think twice about the bus ride required to drop in  i am always greeted with smiles  ken has no hesitations taking time to fill me in on new  old titles  letting me know what story arcs i am behind on  etc  great selection of comics  trades  and figurines  if they dont have it and you want it  they will find it  ken has even sold me stuff out of his own collection before    its the corner stone to any trip i make to downtown glendale  allways worth the trip 
i am giving a 1 because i can not give a zero   last night me and my fiance visited for food after seeing a concert  it took 3x to get our order right via the box before getting to the window  then when we got there he tried to charge us for another order that was double ours  all while yelling over  through my car to someone else in their giant cargo truck   we finally got our correct order    or so i thought  my sandwich that was supposed to have sausage added  and i was charged for    was missing sausage entirely  if that wasnt bad enough my croissant was partially burned  not over done but black   i said whatever and figured i would call and address this in the morning  i called and asked for a manager  apparently one is not there on the weekends  i was at least offered a team lead   ok  at least this can get addressed   nope  i was greeting with a shouting  what do you need   not so much as a  how do you do    corporate will hear about this  i will also never come back to this place either  your restaurant and employees give fast food chains a bad name  shame shame      feel free me directly should you choose  i would love to discuss this and maybe be assured this will be resolved as i would rather not drive an extra mile or so to another one  which has always been a  by the way 
this restaurant was the worst dining experience i ever have had  we went with friends to have a bite to eat and some wine  we waited 40 minutes to get drinks for three of our five people  and ten minutes later the owner came to deliver the other drinks  he told us that our waiter was having a  meltdown  so he  the owner  brought the other drinks  thirty minutes after that no one had revisited the table for food or additional beverages   when two of us went to the bar to speak to the owner about this situation  we were told he had left 15 minutes earlier  leaving an incompetent staff in charge  the calamari we ordered tasted like frozen calamari in a package  the rest of the food tasted pretty good  except for one main entre salad which contained the base core of a lettuce head  buried within the salad  it was not supposed to be there  there were only three other tables being served so it was not busy  but the overall dining experience was so unbelievably poor  that it gives dining out a bad name  no one  even the owner apologized or offered to comp anything for the acknowledged poor service and i do not recommend this restaurant to anyone   our  155 tab was not cheap and extremely overpriced for the quality of service  wine and food  dont waste your time or your money 
love thus place  great atmosphere  love coming to the patio for drinks at night or for brunch on sunday  their fresh made oj is the best  
i live and have lived about a mile from this place and finally stopped in a few days ago  i really like it here  they have a large selection of all kinds of used books  they arent as big as some of the other used books in the valley but i walked out with more than a few books for under  20  if your in the area i highly recommend checking it out  just take a look
awesome awesome happy hour and its long from 3 7  great selection of drinks and a great vibe  food was really good too  had the zucchini poppers and they were average  but the queso and carne were great  so was the blt  we will def be returning

weve been loving on todds for years and last night was no exception  a flawless meal  start to finish  with top notch attentive service from the entire staff  chef todd serves up the best ahi in all of vegas  beautifully rare and moistly flavorful nestled on a bed of wasabi mash  bam  salmon was brilliant and perfectly done  spinach quinoa cranberry salad went to the next level with the addition of roasted butternut squash  addictive  always a splendid wine list  something for all tastes and pocketbooks  check out this neighborhood gem for a gourmet dining experience youll treasure 
this place was great  went here with my family on a wednesday night   best way to describe it   old school italian    the best thing ever rolls in garlic   butter  table had fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was excellent   had the potato   bacon soup  amazing  had the fettuccine   meatballs  sauce and pasta was also amazing  meatballs were good   parents had the veal and fettuccine alfredo and they loved it   place served amazing food and the portions are huge   eat here if you have an opportunity 
i am a las vegas local  and this is personally one of my favorite places for any meal of the day  especially if you get a table on the outside patio  it is directly across the street from the bellagio fountains  which is such an amazing bonus to get to see while you eat  ive also always had amazing service ever time i go there  the last time i went kate and jose provided my boyfriend and i with exceptional service  we had the seafood platter and the lamb  and the lamb was absolutely out of this world  i highly recommend mon ami gabi for an enjoyable and memorable las vegas dining experience 
i love robin at epoca  shes been my stylist for about 3 years now and never disappoints  she always takes the time to listen to me and the end results are fantastic  ive had very short and now ive grown it out and shes amazing at getting the exact look im going for  ive never had to wait and am always able to book in no problem 
up here in pineville for work and had to come visit this place  very authentic german cuisine  they are closed on mondays  the atmosphere is nice  the beer is even better  if youre ever up this way  this is a must visit for authentic german did 
kim was an amazing dance instructor  we took lessons from her in 2008 for our wedding  our major challenge was a huge difference between my hubbys dance expertise and mine  i am not an expert by far but have had more training than he had  i wanted our first dance to be enjoyable for both of us and pleasant for our guests  at the end of our experience  my husband felt more confident  our guests were amazed at our dance  and we have a great memory from our reception   after all the stress of wedding planning  taking these lessons with kim was the best part of preparing for the wedding as a couple  we had so much fun and really looked forward to each upcoming lesson  kim is patient and creative  she always has a smile and is full of energy  the studio space was great with hardwood floors and walls lined with mirrors so you could see how you were performing   this was the best money we spent on any vendor and i highly recommend it to any couple with impending nuptuals 
love it here  i am always a bit apprehensive when taking my kids to the dentist because i want them to have positive thoughts about dental cleanings  the facility is fun and filled with things to distract the kids like toys  ipads  and tv on the ceiling while laying back for the cleaning  the staff is great in relating to my kids and getting them to relax  dr laurie is sweet yet knowledgeable  overall  a wonderful practice and i am relieved as a parent to see my kids developing a positive attitude about dental visits 
a great place to visit  we usually only go around the fall  but they are open year round  the orchard is huge and i am usually exhausted at the end of this excursion  the kids have a blast picking pumpkins  fruits  and vegetables  this year they got to play in the hay maze    i was very impressed with the place when the line to cash out was long  the staff started passing out water bottles to the customers  such a wonderful family run place  i plan to keep supporting this place because it is such an asset to northwest las vegas and i want to see it stay for years to come 
believe all the negative reviews  worst hotel in las vegas or anywhere for that matter   cramped elevator area with slow elevators and no ac  by the time you get to your room  you are already sweaty   bathroom is dirty  moldy and has no vent  small black bugs fly around  tub does not drain  room is dark  the dark colored carpet  is so dirty it will turn the bottom of your feet black  the mattress is so uncomfortable you can feel the spring  the ac is loud and difficult to adjust  the internet simply does not work  there is no pool in this hotel  basically there are no amenities what so ever  yet they have the nerve to charge a resort fee   this place is so gross it should be torn down  come to this hotel if you want to torture yourself 
im so thankful i relied on yelp to find dr  levins in 2012  for the few years  hes been there for me and helped me tremendously  his politeness and knowledge are an absolute blessing  without question  hes one of the better doctors ive ever seen in my life  thanks again 
hidden gem  seriously  if youre serious about coffee then look no further  the owner  ron cortez  is passionate about coffee and stands by his product  truly refreshing to meet people that believe 100  in their product 
the cocktails are kinda pricey for fremont   9  10  but well worth it  awesome gin and tonics and long island ice teas  you know youre getting your moneys worth which can be hard to find in this city 
place is amazing  pierogis are delicious  staff is awesome   i love the atmosphere  a must try 
very late in writing my review for this particular travelodge  location is okay because its almost in the center of the vegas strip and affordable  beware of room 227 if youre trying to sleep in  we kept hearing the door slam near by where all the housekeepers were  you can hear them talking and laughing while waiting to grab their linen carts  it was just noisy  we werent able to sleep in at all 
we are here twice for breakfast during our scottsdale vacation   it was or favorite   food was delicious  atmosphere was great   service was perfect   the poblano polenta benedict was amazing 
not a bad place to stay   on the monorail line with kitschy attractions to check out inside like the start trek adventure  restaurant and attraction  and barry manilow  need i say more   we tried the breakfast buffet since it was free with gold status and it wasnt decent but i would not have been happy if i paid  we stayed in a recently renovated room so that was nice 
this is my second time renting storage space from this location  i received excellent customer service from katie when i came in to rent the space  i like that they offer drive up  garage door type space  it makes it so easy to unload and load stuff  my only negative would be that the facility is not accessible 24  7  but that is not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things 
this restaurant was amazing  i loved everything about it  the food was delicious   had the butchers board and the bruschetta  there was so many bruschetta options  the wine was very good as well  the atmosphere was so much fun  i loved the set up and the music was on point  song after song that played made the experience that much better  the only downside was we had a long wait but it was a friday so it was expected  tried to make a reservation but they dont make them for parties less than 5  on the plus side got to drink our bottle of wine while we waited 
so good  crispy chicken skins are amazing   bacon jam is a must try  jerk turkey burger is so good  love this place 
both my wife and i got sick the next day after eating at carrabbas   the wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures  we will not be eating here again 
the service was alright  the food i thought was also so so  nothing too great but decent  i felt the ratio of meat to noodles in the yakisoba was not reasonable  there was way too much noodles   not too sure if i would come back here again  but i dont live too far so maybe ill give it another go someday 
so i am a bit harsh when it comes to thai food  what i ordered was basil  and coming from a thai family  i would like authentic   it wasnt cooked exactly how i would like it  however the spice was up to par  the place was cozy  it wont be my primary place to head to  but i will definitely eat here again 
love this salon  ive lived in las vegas for 15 years and have been lucky to be a client of many top notch salons  square is by far my favorite   heres why    scheduling   scheduling seems like a pretty easy thing to be on top of especially when youre offering a service like hair styling  you would think so but  in my experience  it absolutely is not   ive had appointments moved and cancelled last minute   ive even shown up for appointments and the stylist is no where to be found  this is not the type of service i expect when im paying  100  for a haircut  at square salon scheduling is a breeze and i havent had a single issue so far  ive always been able to get in and i love that they send a reminder email and also a reminder call the day before your appointment    paying  100  for a haircut is absurd  which brings me to my second point   square salon is very reasonably priced compared to what ive paid in similar quality salons   the salon  located in summerlin  is very upscale and the stylists who work there are talented and experienced  i would gladly plunk down more for the cuts ive received here but i dont have to and i love that    lastly  the girls who work here are absolutely amazing  especially chita  so sorry if i misspelled that but its pronounced like the cat  and amy lara   both girls are terrific at what they do and a pleasure to visit with during your appointment  all of the stylists  assistant stylists and front deal staff are friendly accommodating   they make visiting the salon something to look forward to every time     very highly recommend you check it out for yourself 
chuck box has the best cheese burger   fries next to whataburger  love there grilled burgers  just like the back yard bbq  just someone else us cooking 
this is the go to place for seafood in phoenix  arizona  the people are friendly and help in assisting with your food selection if needed 
this has become a go to spot for lunch  due to its proximity to my office and their quick service  not to mention their good food  portions are quite decent for the counter service items  so i sometimes have two meals out of a single order  i usually order off the menu unless im in a hurry  so ive only had the counter service a few times    the pho is good  although the broth is not as flavourful as other places ive gone to  my favourite dish so far is the lemongrass chicken with rice  but im slowly working my way through the menu to try lots of different dishes  i had the chicken in red curry on my last visit and it was really good 
this is another good place for a nightcap at the wynn  encore resort  of course  they serve the same drinks as all the other wynn  encore lounges  parasol up is louder and smokier  so we opted for parasol down which is a small indoor area surrounded by curved escalators and a larger outdoor area with a direct view of the lake of dreams with the show of quirky vignettes  although they have heaters  its too cold to sit outside in winter  the show can be seen from all parasol bars and is also viewable from other places like sw steakhouse and lakeside restaurants 
supposedly  this is an art collection that includes works by masters like picasso  the works used to have a gallery  but is  allegedly  hung throughout the resort  sure  there is art hanging on the walls  but it is mostly woven art  i searched main floor of wynn and encore including the long halls around the conference rooms on 11  21  11 and failed to find anything from the wynn collection 
one of the few places that i used to eat dim sum at in montreal was kim fung in chinatown  im not sure if these two are related but i mistakenly thought in my mind that kam fung was kim fung  oops  well  if you find yourself crossing the bridge and heading to the south shore  this might be worth a try   on boxing day  we decided to brave the crowds and head out for dim sum  lucky for us  one of my relatives got there early and managed to get the  1 spot  first one seated  all i can say is get there early because the lineup was pure insanity  the seating area is massive  think banquet style  yet it was completely full by 11 00am  when we were trying to exit  it was like leaving a zoo    there were 15 of us so no way good pictures were going to happen  we ate the usual staples  ha gow  siu mai  cha siu bao  ha cheung  woo guk  tripe  bean curd  fried squid  rice with spare ribs  and jouk to name a few   the prices are in the  3 75    5 50 range if i recall correctly    decent dim sum but pretty standard in my books  i wouldnt drive all the way off the island if it was my choice 
ive tried several things from different sushi rolls to the singapore noodles  pearl platter  very greasy   fried calamari  and the curried chicken skewers  nice sweet peanut sauce   the food is definitely a okay  but nothing really to write home about  like i know i liked the sushi rolls that i have gotten  but i cant remember anything specific about them   also  ive ordered everything through ubereats so i cannot comment what its like to dine in  but i will say that its very thoughtful of them to include utensils  sauces  and even cookies with your take out order    i will probably give them another try  they do have a huge menu and i have only sampled a small portion of it    that is all 
i do prefer not to go to chains  but sometimes it is the best option when youre looking for all you can eat shrimp  affordability  and to relive childhood memories  i have not been to a red lobster in many many years  but i was really craving some shrimp and they had their special going on so i was like  lets do this    roll up on a sunday afternoon with a friend and we both got the all you can eat shrimp special for  17 99  with the meal you get a salad and a side  i went with a caesar salad and upgraded to the lobster mashed potatoes  just a tip  ask for your dressing on the side  otherwise your salad is going to be saturated with dressing  our waiter tim brought us out some fresh cheddar bay biscuits  for the shrimp i tried the buttery scampi  the new nashville hot  coconut shrimp bites  and the shrimp alfredo  the nashville hot was really good   fried  with a spicy kick and a drizzle of sweet honey  the alfredo is a huge portion with a hint of garlic  they let you take home your leftovers which provided me with two more meals    our waiter tim was on top of his game  pleasant and attentive  the manager even stopped by twice to check in on us which i thought was a nice touch    overall it was a good gluttonous lunch with great service  the things is though  eating here gave me a wake up call  in looking back at the picture i took of my plate  everything is a variation of white  tan  no color  when i tracked what i ate in the myfitnesspal app it came out to 3 535 calories  split over 3 meals and includes half a slice of chocolate cake   like sweet baby jesus  i do not regret coming here  but it will probably be my last visit  i dont mind being juicy  but as juicy as a gallon of milk is way too much  i need to stay home and eat broccoli 
ive been in rr a year and a half now  but i just recently decided to see what the area had to offer for chinese  i stopped by late on sunday and the parking lot only had a few empty spaces  once inside there was a constant stream of people picking up their take out  connie who works the front  bar area is well known by the customers and often had friendly greetings for them  after i ordered my wait time was about 15 20 minutes even with them being so busy    for food i got the sesame chicken  13  rounding up here  turned into a combo dinner for an extra  6  this included wonton soup  one rib  one jumbo fried piece of shrimp  and one egg roll  i also got a side of the crab rangoons for  6  i think there were 8 of them  so my total came to  25  i thought this was a little pricey  but i ended up getting 3 meals out of it    downside is that i felt meh about the food  when i think of chinese food i think of the stuff that is so bad for you but oh so good  its cheap and will make you feel bloated the next day  but you have no regrets  its also a requirement that you eat this stuff in your sweatpants  king wah seemed like it tried to be a little fancier but came up short  the chicken was not crispy fried chunks of tasty questionable mystery meat coated in delicious sauce  instead it barely had a bread coating on it  the chicken was all white meat  but way too many pieces contained that hard cartilage  stringy vein stuff that youre supposed to cut out and throw away  plus it looked so sad drowning in all that sauce  luckily  sarcasm  though it had hard chunks of vegetables to cling to  the fried rice that came with it was sad and plain with just a few bits of egg mixed in  nothing else    i did really like the bbq rib  and there was a tiny side of this pineapple sauce that i dipped my shrimp in that was tasty  the egg roll seemed to be of a decent size and the taste was standard  wonton soup was okay as well  the crab rangoons though were a little plain  but you can never go that wrong with fried dough and cream cheese    overall the food wasnt terrible  but it wasnt what i was expecting or craving  i guess i just prefer my chinese take out to have low standards  i shall continue my search 
went here as part of my random spa day because i was wanting to try acrylic nails for the first time  the inside of the place could use a little make over  the huge fish tank in the front needs to go  but the people were all very friendly so i think that makes up for some things  my nails turned out so pretty  so i would recommend this place if you want your nails done  but i am giving 3 stars because i also got a pedicure and it wasnt so great    oh and you can only leave a cash tip so make sure youve got some before you go in 
ordered the st patricks mint with gummy bears and chocolate chips  the medium is the perfect size for after dinner  the staff was very friendly and the location was clean  try the salted caramel too  it was to die for  reasonably priced for all that you get for it  a medium size will get you three toppings  this location has great outdoor seating too 
great vegan food  ive decided that this is a very healthy choice for lunch and dinner when eating out  all their ingredients appear very fresh and expertly prepared  they also serve great juice blends and coffees  so this can also be a great place to hang out for a quick snack   staff were super friendly  you can pay by card using square on a cool swivel ipad  this place is really in tune with the modern age on many levels   highly recommended if youre looking for healthy eats before heading over to see a movie at harkins superstition springs  just down the road 
it all started because i wanted a drink after work  then someone mentioned  5 wild boar nachos and the rest is me laying in a food coma on my couch    i highly suggest people check this place out  just be warned that after 6 30pm  this place is going to fill up fast and get loud   at least on a friday night   a friend and i split the nachos mentioned above  guac with goat cheese  al pastor taquitos  and a side of refried beans  the portions were big enough to share and there was a little leftover to take home  my only complaint would be that for  14 the taquito entree should have included the side instead of having to pay extra for it    definitely get the margarita flight to go with your meal  we shared the hibiscus flower  cucumber  and this spicy mango margarita that makes you feel all nice and warm inside 
del taco is the second faux mexican aberration to come out of california  behind taco bell    being a transplanted californian in las vegas  ill go out of my way for robertos   that being said  itll do in a pinch 
this is the best thai place in vegas   period   end of sentence   ive been all over country  from udorn to hatyai  and this place is just good old fashioned thai home cooking and bangkok street food   i dont know where food network get off on lotus of siam  worst in town  
old school vegas at its best   this place is arguably the best italian food in town   i had the eggplant de amore with a side of meatballs   both were perfectly cooked and incredible   its a bit pricey  but well worth it for a special night out 
melissa takes good care of our sheltie pomeranian mix   theyre friendly  professional and reasonable 
adequate   the free thai tea for my first yelp check in was nice   the panang gai wasnt spicy at all and was a bit bland   the rice didnt smell or taste like jasmine rice   ill try again and let you know 
lets just say that if you have a choice between chipotle and this place  youre crazy if you go to chipotle   i had the steak burrito  enchilada style  wet with cheese baked on   lots of cheese    delicious at a reasonable price 
food was good but took 30 minutes to get from the time we ordered   this location is understaffed and the staff appear undertained  they would be better off closing for the day if they are that thin on help  i will not go back to this location 
i recommend dr  harter  he is kind and listens to the patients needs  he takes pride in being present for the birth unlike many other group practice obgyns in which case you get whoever is working on the day you go into labor  unless you schedule an induction or c section   you should especially see dr  harter if you plan to have a natural birth  he is completely supportive of a womans choice to labor with as little interventions as possible  great doctor 
wonderful place to go get your nails done  son  ivy and heather are great at what they do  they keep it very clean and sanitary  candy nails offers all the   new stuff  when it comes to nail options  from the classic french to aquarium nails and mood changing polish  they do it all   
this is great  angela is a terrific bartender  good drinks  excellent service  personable  and makes our business meetings go smoothly  stop by  ask for angela and enjoy the best experience ever   food is great too    dont miss this chance to relax and enjoy  yum                                                                           i hate seeing good places get in trouble but    alas eb has closed  it seems they are closing many locations which is a shame as theyve been a standard for decades  good luck everyone in the reaming locations 
amazing staff and equally delicious food  tried their pasta dishes and ice coffee and they were amazing  nice quiet place if you want good food and a little different than typical starbucks  and their latte art    omg its the cutest thing  definitely recommend this hidden gem 
very nice staff  great food and pretty fair prices  i come at least once a month  i do think they can use a little bit more  privacy  i dont like sitting next to strangers while enjoying a dinner with my friends  kinda feels a little awkward when the strangers youre sitting next to is filming you catching food in your mouth 
remember its a crab shack not a high end restaurant  take it as it is and enjoy the fun atmosphere  great food good times 
mal is my stylist  she fixed a horrible mistake of a mess that someone at another salon made and always gives me what i want  shes a blast to talk to and never overcharges me  i always get what i go in for and never leave unsatisfied  i wont ever go to another stylist     everyone else in the salon seems really cool too  they understand what i want and never talk down to me or overcharge me 
i honestly think that im like one of the only straight girls in the world who likes this place  i love the sports bar atmosphere and their food is really good  i used to order the take out wings all the time back in the day   the waitresses are always really nice  i went to a hooters in california once and our waitress was so rude  you could tell she was a frustrated and annoyed failed actress and was taking it out on her customers  the girls who work at this location are mostly college girls and dont have a bad attitude    the last time i came here was with my family for my little brothers 13th birthday  the waitress was really nice and attentive  when we asked her if the fried pickles were good  since we hadnt been in years  she said   if you like pickles the fried pickles are good    it was the silliest response ever and she instantly realized it and laughed with us  it was just a pleasant atmosphere in general   they took my brother to the front and made him stand on a chair with balloons stuffed in his shirt while the girls sing him happy birthday  it was really nice of them to go above and beyond the average ice cream with a birthday song  they also gave him a calendar that all the waitresses signed for him   i have this theory that the only people who dont like hooters are jealous girls and  or men who would rather be at strip club but their wives wont let them go   could have done without the upstairs location though  id imagine after having a few drinks it would suck to get out   maybe thats the point  
first let me start out with our server shay  amazing  the atmosphere here is great  this is our first time in and everything looks amazing  as our food sales pitcher shay would say she doesnt have to try very hard when the food is amazing  wow is she right  we ordered everything from nashville hot chicken to the shiitake garlic noodles  think we found our new hangout  sports bar setting with a finer dining feel  ok so after devouring our whole meal the consensus is beyond ridiculous  right down to the darn pickles as a garnish  pub  bar yes food way above that 
ordered for 5 pm at 1pm  cab comes at 5 30 pm  15 degrees  fail  yelp wants me to add more  but theres not really much more to add    
this was a pretty awful experience  the serving situation was  well  lets say odd   we arrived on a beautiful sunday holiday weekend evening and took a seat on the much revered patio  seeing no host person in sight  we soon saw the server cleaning up the table next to us  but were ignored  we still waited a good five minutes for him to greet us  there we four parties on the patio  in case he was busy  well  eventually we have up and my husband ordered at the bar  a newly arrived couple next to us apparently experienced the same confusion  as they asked my husband for a menu when he returned with our drinks  having mistaken my husband for a server     the patio itself was drab  with unlit candles on the tables  and an enclosed wood fence on either side  the only redeeming quality was that you could hear the band from inside  who was quite good     i ordered the grand margarita  which tasted watered down  and lacked any salt on the rim or lime on the side  which i would expect to be standard for a 12 dollar authentic margarita  the night continued to head downhill  as the couple next to us started smoking like it was the last day on earth  as well as the couple behind us  as well as the wait staff lining the walls and smoking on their break  as one might predict  the air soon became unbreathable in this small mostly enclosed space  we booked it outta there once we couldnt hold in the cough any longer     my lungs may never forgive me    i really wanted to like this place based on many local recommendations  but after this disaster of an experience  how could i 
never ever get the all you can eat  hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isnt even grilled  they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi  its like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly  also  service was unfriendly 
i got some sushi for take out and i was impressed  ive been to another popular sushi restaurant in town and i was not a fan  im so glad i found this place  the spicy tuna poppers are so good  i got the spicy tuna and hamachi hand roll as well  i will order the orange blossom roll again  it looked like a fun atmosphere inside as well  i will definitely be back for happy hour 
my boyfriend told me that the sushi we had was the best he has ever had there and that we must have hit it on an on night  we had the avocado suhsi and that incredible    the california rolls were just so so  the people there were the most ridiculous part and made me feel as though we should have been heading to a frat party after our  date  
great service   friendly staff  paige is awesome   i became a loyal customer right off the bat  my appointments are always on time  i would highly recommend wax in the city to anyone 
i visited this bakery twice and did order 8 dozen  baseball  cupcakes for a birthday party for two great nephews   i provided a picture of what i wanted per this bakerys request   when i arrived to get the 8 dozen cupcakes  i was very upset to see that not only did they look nothing like the picture i had provided  but they also had two different shades of red for the laces   per the person in the bakery at the time   well  we could re ice them  but that would take 1 1  2 hour    i dont think they pay attention to what the customer asks for   in other words  if they dont already make something  i dont think they can create what you really want 
o k  tires is my go to place to get a tire  patch  or even swap out tires that i already have  they have good prices and are just all around nice guys  they are honest and will even just give you advise  if you are unsure of what to do  its also nice to support small  local businesses  i will continue coming here and will always recommend this shop to anyone who is in need 
very professional staff   helpful since it was our first time buying legal weed  wide variety of choices  almost overwhelming if not for the knowledgeable budtenders around  gpod experience  
the barista is like the friendliest guy in the world  smoothie was absolutely delicious and i usually dont like iced coffee but this guy makes it right  i love this place 
in my search for the best boba spot in las vegas  i found myself at lollicup  its a franchise that has many locations in socal  this lollicup is located in the middle of town square  it is in one of those little kiosks that are along the pathway near the kids play area    watermelon slush   amazing  the flavor was perfect  not artificial tasting at all which was suprising  i got a large size with boba and it hit the spot in 115 degree weather  cant go wrong with watermelon anything   milky way   its a milk tea with caramel  pudding  and boba  its sweet  but not overwhelmingly sweet  not too sure if i would get this again   these two large drinks together was about  11  which is a little pricey  but then again it is on las vegas blvd  the only downfall is that parking at town square can be difficult to find on a weekend night 
this place has really good soup dumplings  they make the dumplings fresh and you can see them making it  i like these dumplings cause they actually have soup in them  ive tried some places where there really isnt any soup  but this place is really affordable and tastes great    downfall is the service is quite crappy  you gotta holler at the waitresses if you need help  so dont be s
just purchased a home with a pool and called hudson pools and spas to open the pool to start the season  when we spoke to the lady initially to set up our opening  we told her that we have never owned a pool before would like some assistance in how to add chemicals and maintain the pool   she said   absolutely  we  help you with that  stroked them a check for  480 to only see them take the pool cover off and throw some shock in the water   when asked about some help in maintenance they said they dont do that 
lift tech was able to come out the same day my garage door motor went out  very knowledgeable about their products and upfront about pricing  the hob itself was fast  clean  and well done  i would definitely use them again  as well as recommend them to friends and family 
we stayed here for 2 nights while visiting toronto   it is a nice location  about 10 minute walk from  via rail train station  and 5 minute walk from the subway station   so if you visit toronto and do not have a car  this location is pretty nice   however  there were a couple things we were not too satisfied during our stay   we checked in around 10pm and only found the room we reserved was not available anymore    we had to point out to the front desk that it was not the room we reserved after we saw the room   although the hotel offers free wifi  it was very spotty in our room   although the hotel also gives free breakfast in the morning  it was always so packed     overall  this hotel is in a nice location   the staff was friendly and nice 
this is the best and most affordable passport photos weve ever got  went there with my husband today and the photographer was very nice  would highly recommend this place to everyone  
i read the other reviews and went  fantastic  all they do is coffee and  i guess tea  so dont go for any other reason  but they are very serious about their coffee  very nice  and totally unpretentious  i tried two different espressos today  a brazilian and a tanzanian  and both were expertly made  will go back tomorrow for further adventures  they also gave me  a first time visitor to montreal with no french  a whole list of food recommendations around town  i went to the marche st  jacques as suggested and it is spot on for my taste as well  if these reviews speak to you  then this is your coffee place   
one of my staples for my old school vegas days  i used to come here a lot  because i could charge everything on the room and it wouldnt be too expensive  had breakfast the other day   quite a good version of the standard staple of steak and eggs   minus a star for it being  20 though    this is vegas  its only supposed to be  9 99     i did love that the waitress brought some heinz 57 though 
i returned and it got that 5th star  one of my favorite restaurants in vegas and i love eating and sharing  the desserts did it  man  the best flan ive ever had  some olive oil ice cream and a chocolate dessert that kind of shut my talkative ass up for a minute    had the paellea  it was good but not as good as i had in spain  i actually enjoyed the fideo type dish  paella with noodles instead of rice   the aioli makes it really good though 
i love their lettuce wrapped burgers  the waiters are always pretty fast and attentive  not to mention their endless salad anddddd sweet potato fries for the hubby  everything we have ordered is always tasty 
never fails  anything and everything is delicious  one of my faves  is the gorgonzola filet mignon    always cooked perfectly and try their bellini     and it never hurts that the staff is always friendly 
ive been to this bike store for coffee and bike service multiple times   the coffee  cafe is very simple so dont come thinking it is competing with coffee shops or you will be disappointed   think more about convenience and youll be fine   coffee and food is decent  service is good   keep in mind the person whose expertise is bike sales and service will be making your coffee and food     bike sales and service straigt forward and no nonsense   if you are looking for a cheap bike  this is isnt the place   if you are looking for a daily  exercise or competitive bike for commuting  mountain or road biking come here   they have excellent knowledge and bikes     this review is mostly about my interaction that had nothing to do with anything move than customer service and kindness   i had previously bought a competition road bike a couple years ago and had them assemble it   fair and reasonable with good service   i was rear ended in by an suv at the end of last year and suffered an tbi  concussion   i am unable to cycle and needed to return the bike to the company i purchased it from   i had a box and a bike but no tools to disassemble it   i asked what turned out to be the owner if he would possible help   he kindly accepted and proceeded to not only disassemble but package and secure the bike free of charge   he had a similar accident and injury a few years earlier and could relate   no charge just a person who was kind and understanding   we talked about various things for 30 minutes and he wished me well    if i could give 10 stars for this review  i would   there are still good people in this world and this proves it 
i thought i reviewed this places eons ago and just realized i hadnt  so here goes   this review is much deserved and long overdue   ive been here about 10 times in the past year or so   the owners are both there all the time and very cool   they care about their customers and putting out a great tasting burger   i always opt for the paradise bacon burger and its never been anything but great   the fries are also very good 
ok   ive been going to this cleaners for months now and im impressed  at least as you can be with dry cleaning   prices are fair  service is friendly  and they will even do your stuff the same day if you prefer   they even notate your preferences in their computer so they know how you like your clothes prepared  i e  starch or no on your shirts  etc   for people who care  they use environmentally friendly cleaning solution and such   by the way  if you need an alterations person  monika works on site and is there most days until late afternoon   she is friendly and very proficient   does an excellent job whether its a pair of jeans or a suit   again  reasonable prices and turnaround time 
where do i begin   way too many to list so ill do a checklist  decor  very well done and tasteful  service  it rocks   attentive  knowledgeable and friendly  food  tasteful  creative  yummy  worst thing which was still acceptable was the parking   i cannot explain to you how much i love this place and everything about it   read my reviews of my other favorite restaurants the tuck shop and noca and add this in the top 3     i digress   the guacamole made at your table kicks fucking ass   absurd how flavorful and you pick your own ingredients to make it how you want it     i also like the fact that the patrons are in more than tommy bahama and khaki shorts   thank you jesus for people giving consideration to not wearing the same attire they left the baseball game in   if you are a foodie or restaurant afficiando  this is your new place   oh and by the way  no out of place looking people   call me superficial but this place feels right  is right and is the chiznit     peace out    
excellent service  tasty burgers of all kinds  and best soda selection ive ever seen 
4 for service   leo was excellent  3 for food   5 for margaritas     this margarita was smooth   not sour  just excellent   waiter recommended excellent south american pinot with the pork pebil   slow roasted heaven in a banana leaf   throw some of that in a corn tortilla and savor   ceviche was ok   serve my favorite thick style chips with a trio of excellent salsas and salts   decor was fun   modern  red  water and slide show of fruits that was  well a little bit suggestive  but hey this is vegas right   
i have ordered from here before for delivery without an issue  last night i ordered for my family on yelp and waited over and hour with no sign of the delivery   the estimate said it was about an hour so i waited to call the restaurant  when i did call the guy you answered made me repeat the address and my order over 5 times before telling me he never got our order  i had a conformation number and email   ill never be ordering from here again  terrible experience 
i love my facials at skin bliss  mary is extremely professional and very knowledgable about skin care  also love her her products  she pampers me  makes sure im comfortable and always provides a good laugh  you cant ask for more than that 
when i booked monte carlo i did read reviews and thought maybe some people were being picky or too harsh however after staying here pretty much all the bad reviews are accurate  ive never left a bad review with any business but my first time to vegas for my 30th birthday was not a great experience because of this resort    when i booked we were told we would be in a new room  we were also told the pool would be down for renovations but we would be shuttled to the mgm pools because all of their pools will be open  so my group booked a cabana at the mgm adults only pool    when we arrived half of my group of 10 were given new rooms and the other were put in old rooms  including my husband and i   they also said they werent doing the shuttle any longer  we got to our room and it was very outdated but the biggest issue is our toilet wouldnt work  i called the front desk 3 times before i finally got it to work but the rest of our trip it was on  off working  plus our shower had hair on the walls which was disgusting but i wanted to try and make the best of our trip  next day we had to walk to the mgm pool just to find out they closed the adults only pool the previous week and didnt bother to notify us  so they placed us in the one pool open and didnt offer a discount for the inconvenience  our server at the pool was fantastic but hes not enough for me to return to monte carlo   ever    even our friends that stayed in the newer rooms werent impressed  the decor is very cold and just put together thoughtlessly  our friends that had an old room were put in a handicap room and had to deal with construction noise at 6 30am everyday   when we checked out i let the manager know about the issues we had and he comped our buffet at the mgm  not great  but didnt offer any comped room or discount to regain our business  so all in all monte carlo is a  get what you pay for  situation   next visit to vegas i will for sure pay more to stay at a cleaner  organized resort 
if it were only a review of dan  the server who waited on me  and the other staff who helped me  the place would get 4 5 stars  or even a perfect 5  the food is what brought my experience down    the place is clean  things were pleasant  food presentation was fast and nice  the caprese was served with just underripe beefsteak tomato  the balsamic was ordinary  at best    the biggest disappointment was the pizza  its rated one of the best in vegas  and id like to meet the people who voted on this and ask them what in the world they were thinking  its far  far from some of the best ive had in life    dont get me wrong  the pie was ok  barely  the old adage rings true  if its good  its great    but id say the pie was just south of mediocre  the crust was the best part and it needed another dollop of sauce  the biggest travesty is they charge a fixed price for toppings regardless of the size of the pie  so  i got a personal pie  12   and paid the same price for my ham and mushrooms that a large pie  18   pays  sorry  but thats just not right    to dans credit  he just listened to my bitching and didnt take one side or other  next time im in vegas and looking for a pizza on the way out of town im headed to metro pizza like i shouldve done tonight 
i have been to montreal 5 times  and i have gotten  2 dollar chow mein  3 times  i know i am heavily biased  but of all of the ideas for street food i have seen  hot dogs  pretzels  bbq  etc   this is by far the greatest  chinese food on the street for all the drunken bar hoppers  freaking  brilliant   last time i was in montreal i was staying near mcgill downtown and we went bar hopping in le village gai  we walked nearly 2 km out of our way to get 2 dollar chow mein  damn was it worth it  is this gourmet chinese food  no  but the sauce is peanuty  the dish is hot  the serving is generous for a twonie  and the concept is incredibly novel and brilliant  chinese food  on the street  open til 3 am  new york  get your act together and get up on this  
my wife and i recently spent 4 nights at the j palen house  we had a great time  the location is perfect and the owners are very friendly and accommodating  i agree with some of the reviews that the website oversells the accommodations but it wouldnt keep us from returning  we found it to be clean  quite  and comfortable  we will be back 
the cupcakes are nicely sized  and they have a variety of flavors  unfortunately we tried the fruity pebble one and it tasted like the cake mix and icing came out of a box  the icing is actually more whipped than a traditional buttercream  too 
this psychic was absolutely amazing  her reading was excellent on the spot   her office is very peace   beautiful filled with great energies   she was very detailed into her reading she knew things no body on earth could of known but me my son and like my other relatives   so she gave me advice on what to do about my ex lover who really hurt me  i came there seeking advice i left with much more then advice     i left with enlightenment   support  love  inspiration and hope   i bought more sessions with penelope   i thank god i did because her  spiritual work   bought forth my boyfriend and i back together       and my son is doing so much better with his education at school  and im just floating on cloud nine thanking god i met this angel xoxoxooxox
i saw all the reviews on this place and thought i would go here for lunch  the only bad thing i can think of is that it is too close to my work    first thing i noticed was this place had kim chee  seaweed salad  and fried fish skin    they basically had me at hello   the seafood delight is the best i have tasted from a buffet  very well flavored and not drowning in sauce and brocolli  the stuffed crab was great and they had vegie tempura that was good too  the short ribs were well seasoned  everything i tasted was good considering it was a buffet  the dishes were always being refilled and i never had to wait for anything    not having too much of a sweet tooth i decided to just walk by the dessert section  big mistake  they had nilla waffers covered with banana pudding  can you say comfort food  so i grabbed a little and on my way back to my seat i picked up a malisada  donut  and fried banana  all was good 
this place is a scam     i moved out the end of september 2010    still had a little over three months on my lease   i continued to pay electric and rent through the end of my lease   when i moved out  they gave me a letter stating not to pay any remaining water bills  that it will revert back to them and they will send a bill to cover it   the issue   after the lease ended  they sent a letter stating that i owed  455 for my final couple of months of water bill   so they kept my deposit and wanted to collect on the remaining   my water bill each month while living there was on average of  50  month    how does that equate to  455 for about three months of time   i checked with the water company and there was usage in the apartment after i moved out   which means the complex was utilizing it for something  or moved someone in  while i was still paying on the lease   the complex did not return calls pertaining to this case   a month later  i get a letter from a collection agency for the remaining portion of the water bill   i explained the situation to the collection agency and presented them with my own findings from the water company    it sounded fishy to the collection agency as well   they put in a request for more detailed information from the complex   a couple of months later  the complex still has yet to respond to the collection agencys request   radio silence from the complex on both sides  but since it was submitted to a collection agency  i have to pay it to keep it from going on my credit   needless to say  i am attaining an attorney 
hands down  my favorite place to grab coffee in scottsdale  great coffee and breakfast burritos  stop by on the weekends and enjoy sitting outdoors while listening to live music  patio is pet friendly 
i have been deynas client for several years   she is quick  efficient and always does a great job   her facilities are clean and lovely   she has a lot of experience  so she will never hurt or burn you   if you are thinking of waxing   call deyna  
food was great  im not big on indian food so i wasnt sure what was on the menu  the guy was more than happy to explain it to me  i got a combo for  10  came with 2 meats  veg  rice  naan  rice pudding  i asked for the tandoori chicken expecting 2 small pieces    but i got one  the naan was cooked fresh infront of me and the guy cashed me out  when i was walking out he told me he was about to close    which got me thinking why didnt they just give me more tandoori chicken if they are closing  but the food was good  service was great  just disappointed that they were cheap on the pieces of chicken  btw  the rice pudding was amazing 
we stopped for the lunch buffet to try out some indian food  the buffet was not huge  but it was tasty and was kept fresh with food  the restaurant itself is nothing special  not a lot of ambiance  but it was clean and our server was friendly  for us it was a good introduction to indian food with a nice sampling of dishes at a good price 
everything here is amazing  the selection of beers  whiskey  cheeses  nuts  jam  everything is great  
i was craving ayce sushi so i went here with a friend that had already been once last week  it is very new and they were still finalizing some of the outdoor heating on the patio  the location is great and i especially liked the roll up door that provides a sushi bar for the patio    i think the servers are new to working in a sushi restaurant but they were friendly and provided good customer service  if you have been to a sushi restaurant and know what you like or want you shouldnt have any problems    they have a very nice decor inside with a large wine room behind glass  along with additional seating further back in the restaurant  we sat up at the sushi bar enjoying a nice afternoon view  they had similar variety of rolls and appetizers you can find at many of the sushi restaurants  along with a few i had not heard of or had before    the sushi chefs working at the time of my visit were very friendly  knowledgeable and accommodating  we were given a complimentary hamachi salad to try  i found a new favorite roll which was the yoshi dynamite  with our mochi dessert our server included a half sample of red bean to try    we left totally full and very satisfied  their ayce lunch was  19 95 and i thought was a great deal  considering how much i ate    overall i enjoyed eating here and thought the food was great  i will look forward to visiting again 
it was very quaint and authentic feeling  coming from someone whos traveled all around ireland it was a treat to find this so close to home  i love the selection of whiskeys as well 
i cannot be happier with my decision to choose cornerstone to start my long term ankle rehabilitation  anna staruszkiewicz is the best physiotherapist i know out there  she is very knowledgeable  accommodating  and has a great balance of professionalism and interpersonal skills   she makes sure you understand the nature of your injuries  prognosis  and goes over your treatment plan thoroughly  i always leave the session feeling great  and most importantly  full of new knowledge that i can apply in my day to day  my progression has been rapid  and anna makes sure i am constantly challenging myself and comes up with new exercises  she addresses your concerns  questions which is very reassuring when you are recovering from a complex injury like me   the front desk staff  jennifer and sara in particular  are also excellent   very friendly and always prompt in responses  you can tell this clinic is well organized and managed   always a good vibe when i come in  i would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good overall experience with your treatment 
go here  seriously  that gambling budget you have  spend it at these tables instead    service  what you expect from a place like this  different bread and dessert combination for our table of 4  server remembered exactly what we each wanted  only delay was the main entree because we ordered the hen  whole hen  that takes a while to cook    food  yes  yes  and yes  forget whatever food you had tasted before  from the butter to the foie gras  better versions than any other place ive ever been to  the bread was just medium to transport more butter to my mouth  d    price  i dont drink so that affects the bill a lot  expect at least  300 per person  this place can easily run into the thousands of dollars if you want    overall  most expensive meal of my life  best meal of my life  totally worth it 
change of ownership   preferred previous owners   the quality of food before 
slammed on their opening day and they nailed it  great beer  terrific atmosphere  excellent staff 
after reading that coconuts fish tacos were the best i had to try them  and everything id read was true  the fish tacos were amazing  the best fish tacos id ever had  my fiance ordered the fish and chips and the fish was pretty good too  their tarter sauce was probably the second best part of both our meals  i will definitely be going back 
yesterday  we took my mom to oreganos for a birthday lunch   not only was the food great  but our server   sarah   went above and beyond   we eat out a lot and she was by far  one of the best and most attentive servers we have ever had  in fact  every worker we came in contact with was polite  professional and helpful   i would like to give a shout out to sarah for a great meal all the way around 
lady  claiming to be japanese  spoke very little to me in japanese  agreed to certain sexual acts  oral contact and nudity    amount was agreed to    she started another act  worth less money  and was difficult  overreacting to my request for her to do what i paid for as if i was robbing her      stay away at all costs 
this was my first time ever visiting this location christine at the front desk was extremely helpful  the whole staff was kind makes you feel welcome and answered all of my questions  i highly recommend this doctor 
i will start by saying i am glad i live far from this place   2 reason  i will be over weight and have diabetes not to offend anyone   but this place is fabulous    every time i try a different pastry but i always get and assorted order of french macaroons  their cold drinks are very refreshing and bistro menu is great and tasty    the negative    space  because is a very popular place it will usually be crowded  to add to the space problem there is a bunch of unusual item  night stands  mannequins  that dont really add decor but take up space    so the place feels a bit claustrophobic and restraint  well dont let that ruin the experience to enjoy what could be the best pastries in town 
been here twice for lunch and its pretty decent  the first time i was expecting just another fast food joint and while it does have that type of vibe  service i was surprise by how good the food was  yes  you build you meal like a subway  in which you choose what you want in your pita sub and you can add chips and a drink  but the combinations are pretty good  plus the have sauces and other ingredients that or places might not have  like hummus and tsakiti sauce  so if you want something  healthy  depends on what you order  and quick  this is a great choice 
welp  as someone who has worked in customer service for years and now works with the public i know how customer service should be and how it shouldnt be  i have never been so disrespected by a cashier in my life  as i brought up a concern he looked me straight in the eye and said have a good day with a grin on his face and tried to push us along  he completely disregarded what i said and then began to argue with me    hopefully he wont be at that gas station very long as one bad employee can really ruin it for the rest of the staff   so to the cashier that worked 7  31  2016 at 10 30 this one is for you  
this was my first time to sweet frog  the shop was very colorful and spotless  at first i was daunted by all the yogurt machines and flavors  fortunately they were not crowded and i was able to take my time and sample different flavors   then we had all the topping choices  wow   my wife and i really enjoyed our first visit and plan to return 
love chompies    probably one of my favorite places in scottsdale for casual eating   my friend and i go every saturday mornings after hiking with the dogs  obviously since we bring the pups we sit outside  i have to say  i am shocked at reading about the terrible service  in the three years i have gone here at least once a week  we have never had terrible service  there is one waiter who i dont think likes serving the patio people  or maybe its just us dog people  but everyone else is amazing  were barely there for 5 min and they are out with water bowls for the dogs  coffee for me  and a diet coke for my friend    on to the food  its thanks to man vs food  and my mom  that i found chompies  she had seen the episode and since i was moving to phoenix  she wanted to try  now every time she visits we have to go at least twice  she has gotten everything from french toast to reubens to chicken and waffles     and shes loved it all  her favorites are the sandwiches because they are enough food for 1 2 more meals   having celiacs disease  i have to go with whats on the gf menu  but i still love it  my go to is the gd bagel w  lox platter  it is so yummy and filling  the rare times i dont get that  i will get the reuben or gf waffles  the pups always get their plate of bacon   chompies is now carrying a variety of gf deserts and pastries  which i love   my non gf friend and i will occasionally split a chocolate and peanut butter brownie  im lucky i have the dog or i would go in before i left and buy more for home   well that it is  well be at chompies with the danes tomorrow for our post hike brunch like we are every weekend 
i loved the atmosphere of this restaurant  it was low key but was a very fun place to dine  we went at night for later dinner  but i see that they have a good hh and a nice patio  great service and food  my personal favorite was the banana stuffed churro  to die for    this was a great find on yelp  since i am not from here and not too familiar with the area 
the food was solid  nice chips and salsa  not too rich of beans  and the right amount of cheese  ordered chorizo and eggs  bean and cheese burrito  carne asada tostada and an enchilada  just because we have to try an enchilada everywhere    chorizo and eggs   good but not great bean and cheese burrito   not overly filled  so it could have had more carne asada   excellent  enchilada   a very good enchilada  not on the menu  so make sure to ask    the only problem was the service  there were only 2 people working  and the woman didnt speak english well enough so the chef had to come out and take orders  so he was obviously very busy and missed the side of rice we ordered  no fault to his own  he was doing everything  but it was something to note  we were thinking that maybe she fits more with the spanish speaking neighborhood  but for us it made it a little difficult to order 
think of it like all of the albertos  albertacos  ralibertos and the rest of the restaurants with the same menu and flavors    we love all of these restaurants   but this one didnt give enough rice in our burrito  we ordered a bean  rice and cheese burrito  but it was by far beans   disappointing  
the red velvet shake is very good and i also had the fried pickles and the blue cheese and bacon fries and they were also very good 
very nice place people are all very polite and helpful  nice pool and fitness area  laundry room is very nice and reasonably priced as well  the evening social hours are an added bonus spotlessly clean and always someone cleaning somewhere nice to see wonderful place will definitely try to return love marriott properties  
came here with friends during a trip to vegas  the food was good and really low priced  only problem or complaint is that the waiter brought out the wrong drinks 
had great food and wine here  had salad  bruschetta and a flatbread  delicious  a bit pricey but i would definitely come here again 
we went on a sunday morning to try their brunch menu for birthday celebration  at the entrance  a large glass showcase of readily made gourmet sandwiches  pastries and salads were prepared for the on the run crew  looked healthy  mouth watering   service was great   responsive  tentative  and warm   free run turkey burger   16  was prepared with condiments of tempura onion  avocado and a dill pickle mayo sauce  it came with a few vegetable chips on the side   the chips were thickly cut and quite hard  requires strong teeth to tear it apart   however  it was not oily at all and seasoned with adequate amount of salt   i quite liked it for a different texture and has a sweet taste to it  while absorbing the fiber and nutrients   no surprise from the burger   the turkey patty was tasty and juicy  while the sauce was not very distinct   it was quite a generic burger  despite having the jazzy ingredients   roast duck poutine pizza   16  was made curds  fries  duck  and accompanied by the recommended nasty sauce on the side   the nasty sauce was an attractive sour and very spicy sauce   the first sample of the sauce was bearable  but the more you try it  the more if feels like your tongue had gone on fire   the pizza was a successful combination of two comfort foods   with a thin crust and a lot of toppings  the pizza was baked just about right to be crunchy and crispy   the juices all retained to make the pizza extremely flavourful and fun to eat   not too complicated or overwhelmed by the burst of toppings   huge potion sizes  we could barely finish it   for an early sunday brunch  i enjoyed the lightness of the meal  and little oil   the environment was just great and relaxing  with quite a bit of privacy to feel comfortable 
using pre bought donut mix and charging way too much for them  then all of this anti gay stuff  wow  please do not go here  ever 
solid burgers  good sides  and good service  our server had great recommendations on beer and burgers  and she wasnt wrong  there are tons of options  and i sampled a little of everything our party ordered  id recommend ordering a burger medium  as specified on the menu  as it wasnt super thick  so it was still nice and juicy without being raw ish   the southwest is great  as is the heart throb  the cheese curds were great  even though they were served with boring ranch sauce  get one of their signature sauces instead   and the fried mushrooms were decent too  i understand the place can get pretty busy  but we went on the night after christmas and the entire downtown was dead  lucky for us  party of 8 seated immediately  next time i will order one of their shakes too 
pretty good neighborhood bar  even at 10am on a sunday morning  great wings  and good wraps  they have live music on the weekends   something thats going away at most places 
i moved here from another state and had to find a place to live in a hurry  i saw this place on line  fell in love with the floor plan  had my daughter come check it out  which she had done for many others and did not find anything she liked  when she came here i received a two word text that simply said  love it   that was it  the place is just as nice as it shows on line  they do not photoshop the pictures to sell you on the apartments     the maintenance staff is wonderful  i had a few minor issues when i moved in and they came and fixed it immediately    the girl in the office was wonderful  there was a bit of a mix up with my move in date as there was a new girl in the office  the girl that was there fixed everything within minutes to help me get in that day    the only reason i did not give 5 stars is the office office are not very good for those of us that work and need to pick up packages  most complexes have hours until at least 6 and usually 1 night they stay open until 6 30 or 7 00  not opening until 8 30 most people have to leave for work earlier than that and do not get home until after 5 30 so you have to wait until sat to pick up something that may have been delivered on monday  i fixed the problem with just having packages sent to my daughters apartments which has hours until 6 00 and she can get home in time to pick them up 
the service here was very rude  she rolled her eyes at me the whole time  i do not appreciate customer service like this could use so much improvement  subs are great though  a pen station would never do this to me 
i usually order the hazelnut chocolate milk tea  but the two times ive had it at this location  both times had powder that had not been dissolved properly in clumps floating around in my drink  almost causing me to choke   also  the line ups at this place are quite insane and i have only ever come twice on very off times to not have to line up  i e  4 45pm on a weekday and late evening on a weekday   i find the warden location to make their drinks better  but theres also huge lineups at that place 
i agree with  r l    you never know what youll get with the internet   i order probably 90  of the things i use and own from the internet and ill definitely be back to princeton should i ever need another watch   good service  correct product  lowest price ive ever seen on my citizen eco drive    everything was done the way things ought to be  as advertised and no b s 
well  i would love to have tried this wonderful food that i read about in the reviews  but i guess i never will   king solomons pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game i absolutely cannot stand   i ordered my pizza over the phone  i was told it would be ready in 15 minutes  to which i thought was pretty fast   as the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up  i said  dont you need my name and number    he replied that it wasnt necessary  that should have clued me in   so  i drive over to pick up my pizza   i walk in and im greeted by a couple guys behind the counter   i let them know im here to pick up my pizza that i ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them   one guy tells the other what i ordered  conveniently ducks out as the other guy then begins to make it  really   so i stop him and tell him why did i order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until i got there   he looks at me and all of a sudden cant seem to understand english and goes back to making the pizza   nice try jerks   i tell him to forget it as i will take my business elsewhere   apparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay  this same technique was used on me before a chinese restaurant in west phoenix    fool me once shame on me  fool me twice  screw you 
there was a mermaid  swimming in the pool  that is all    with a fish tail and erythang
chamberlain is most professional office ive ever been too  polite and friendly staff every single visit  caring staff that makes kids feel at ease during procedures  very clean facility each tray is carefully sterilized and after each patient the entire table and knobs are sterilized for the next patient  dr chamberlain gets to know his patients and chats about their interests each visit 
the best ever   i had tried pilates out before with private sessions but its def more fun to do it in a small group setting  very encouraging and challenges you to push yourself  i would say that each instructor has their own style of teaching  megan and carolyn i found had classes at a slower pace  theyre still a good workout  but i did find that i could complete the class with little to no troule  alice kim amanda and roselby are very challenging with their workouts  i would def  reccomend going to their classes after trying out a few classes with other instructors   monica is one of my fav instructors   shes also the owner of the studio  super hands on with you and really helps even the most beginner of students during the class  she teaches a more classical style of pilates where you repeat the same movements each class  still very challenging  but perhaps push yourself to the more advanced level of that posture  the other instructors teach more contemporary style pilates which is more upbeat  and athletic style  i would def  recommend     my only other suggestion   please add saturday and sunday classes to the caledon location    
its a post office  there isnt much to say  but the staff are pretty friendly and very helpful  i got what i wanted posted so job done    overall  a decent post office  cant really complain  i only went there because i needed to  but i will go again 
just came here a few days ago   i was expecting a lot better   i wish the rating score would also do 1  2 points because if it did this review would be a 3 5   i ordered 2 tacos de adobada  spicy pork   1 tongue  and 1 tripe   i ordered my tacos with everything which is cilantro  onion and salsa   the adobada tacos were good   i was not a huge fan of the tortillas   they somewhat have a flavor that regular tacos do not have  not even tacos in mexico   the tongue taco was ok   the tongue was just not too flavorful  probably not seasoned enough with salt    the tripe taco made me disappointed   the tortilla to this taco was warm because they had just warmed it up but the tripe was kind of cold    which was sad because these are my favorite tacos   the color of the lard was white with clearly shows also that the tripe was cold   my tacos came with grilled onions and peppers   these were good  up to now  the best tacos in las vegas are still the ones on lamb and bonanza   las taquizas   i am trying different tacos in vegas to see if i find any better but so far those are the best   if i am ever in the area  and really wanted tacos  i would give this place another chance 
this is my 2nd time here   both times i had tacos and they are the best ive had in las vegas   i love the style of the tacos and jaime really hooks you up  the tacos are big  and they have the perfect amount of meat    i order the tongue tacos and pastor and they were really good   besides the great food jaime has the best costumer service   both times i have been there we talk like we have known each other for a while   he is from veracruz and doesnt like the hot weather here in vegas     go and enjoy the food  and get to know this awesome man   
the hotel itself is nice and its in a great location  but the staff is clueless   first of all  the ac in my room didnt work   i had to endure two days in a hot  muggy room   they sent clueless people who couldnt fix a thing   finally  the evening of day 2 they sent someone who actually resolved the issue   when i went to check out they gave me a huge hassle about a late checkout  because the football crowd was coming for the weekend   after spending  1000 over 3 days and being miserable the first two  they couldnt find a way to let me stay until 1 00 p m   i travel to charlotte for business 5 6 times a year   ill never stay at this hotel again   there are a lot of better options 
came here with my husband  brother in law and sister in law for our first night out after having our twins   we had been here once before and i had been craving the amazing brussels sprouts nachos   steven was a great server and made a ton of awesome recommendations   we followed nearly every one  including three desserts that were by far the most amazing thing this mama has had in a long time   the braised pineapple pork and green chili chicken tacos were also on point  we will be back again very soon   and i will most definitely be asking to end the evening with a campfire   thanks for an awesome evening out  
a much needed addition to the neighbourhood  good and service both fantastic  its not fancy but it has more personality than most 
i want to give this restaurant a 3 5  its perhaps one of the coolest  tiny packaged little building ive been in for a restaurant  beautiful  that alone was impressive to me   the servers were so nice and accommodating   although our server was not fluent in english  she tried her best and it was appreciated     ill be honest to say i didnt know what to expect when i ate here  its unique  one of the most unique fusion tasting foods ive had  we tried a various of different dishes  although not everything was to my taste  i dont remember hating any of the dishes so much that i wouldnt take another bite   yes i would try this restaurant again  d perhaps i should brush up on my french before going back    
i properly heart this place  it makes me feel like a kid in a sweet shop   except older and with beer and  supposedly  enough common sense to know better  the hangover i had on sunday suggests ive got a bit to go there yet      the couple of times ive popped in here have been all too brief as far as i am concerned and one day i will make it back here and stay long enough to try as many sweets as it takes me for me to talk nonsense and require rolling back on to a train  not many i fear    the beer and whisky selection is pretty fantastic  plenty of stuff i recognised  and plenty i didnt but was intrigued by  got to try a wee beer id had my eye on for a while and whilst it wasnt anything much to write home about after all  the other 2 plus the whisky were pretty awesome  im not usually one to go for dark beers but the coconut porter i had reminded me of a tin of quality street someone had tried to drown in booze  as odd as that sounds  its definitely a good thing    the barman is lovely  chatty and knowledgeable without being pushy or in your face  a good dude  if youre a beer head  get yourself in here  its great 
great place  accommodating and the staff was awesome i had an incident yesterday  they had some sort of rapper or hip hop artist staying in the room next to mine  they were being loud  a lot of cursing and shouting  many doors brig slammed  and this occurred in the room  which was next to mine  and in the hallway  it went on until late at night  4 am  i felt unsafe and not comfortable calling security  i should  retaliation was my main concern  i expressed my discontent this morning and manager gave me the possibility if late check out  which was nice considering my flight is schedule to depart at 6 pm  all and all it was good  however i would recommend to any hotel that have guests that are prone to kiss behave and not obey the rules to either not have anyone stay in t contiguous room  or on the floor at all  or to warn them prior to checking them in 
excellent service  best chinese  thai restaurant in town  highly recommended 
dependable  quality service that will go the extra mile to get it done   kathy archambault at the kierland office is the best  and i appreciate all that she does to make any closing experience less stressful 
i was pretty psyched about the first nandos in downtown toronto  i used to love this place as a late night fast food option during the years i lived in nairobi  kenya  it was cheap  open and pretty decent for post bar food   not so fast  this place is trying to be more of a sit down restaurant with table service  its not really quite there  however  when i arrived  party of one  i was told to pick up a menu and order from the till  which is pretty awkward  my waiter wouldnt seat me  but kind of rudely gestured to a table across the room   i ordered my meal with some suggestions from the friendly girl at the till  1  4 chicken  leg   thigh  plus 2 sides  peri peri fries   casa salad  and a soft drink  the total came to something over  16   tip  so yeah  were already way out of the league of most fast food places   having paid  i trudged over and picked up some hot sauce and napkins from a huge shelf at the back  my food arrived pretty quickly  but i realized i would need to go back to the shelf for cutlery  another trip was required when i realized the  casa salad  was undressed  what a pain    the chicken leg was good  but small  the fries were limp and lukewarm  they seem to have run out of fries too  as a few small wedges were thrown in to fill it out  the salad  in addition to being undressed was as basic as salads come  it was served in a tiny bowl  which meant it was impossible to dress properly  or eat without dropping cucumbers or lettuce leaves    the waiter popped by once for a cursory  hows everything  to which i lied   fine    overall this place is a kind of ethnic theme park pseudo fast food restaurant with half decent chicken at inflated prices  i wont be back anytime soon  shame  they should have stuck with the fast food philosophy instead of this half way bucket of mediocre 
the service was fast and friendly  the spring rolls and  combination pho were delicious  the pho had just the perfect amount of meat  i dont think ive ever spent just  8 on such a great meal 
ive been here many times over the years and my opinion just gets better  the food is so good  i swear their coleslaw should be called crack slaw    also  they do buck a shuck on sundays  their tacos are just amazing  fried shrimp big standout     we will keep coming back 
came here about a month ago or so for a nose piercing  i must say    great place for a piercing  i was in   out in about 10 minutes w  o an appointment  i loved the kool aid jammer    brandi made it quick   easy for me  will be coming back in the near future 
this is one of my favorite places to dance the night away  i love that they have super cheap drinks and they play great music
this is a nice  free museum in an unbeatable location  the staff are friendly and helpful  there are displays pertaining to wars from the civil war through present day  concentrating on the wi connections  id definitely suggest combining this with a visit to the wi historical museum across the street for a fun museum day downtown  photos allowed  but no flash  i particularly loved the exhibit of art made by veterans 
excellent handmade margaritas   menu exciting making it difficult to decide   service and presentation are excellent   another of the out of sight delights   try it 
i got a groupon for hottcakez  i called at 10 11am on monday and the gal on the phone told me to come by at 12 30pm  because thats when they would be open and i could come in and pick out a dozen cupcakes  so  my sister  my 5 year old niece  7 week old niece  and i went shopping near by to kill two hours  for some reason nothing in las vegas is close by  the freeway and highway are all so round about  it takes you almost 30 minutes to get anywhere  anyway  we came back at 12 30 on the dot and the place still was not open  i went up to the door to check and one of those generic clock signs said  be back at and the clock arms pointed to 1pm  disappointed  i got back in the car  told my sister the situation  and waited  my sister had to make a phone call  so she agreed to wait  1 00pm came and went  at 1 10pm i called the number again this time with no answer and i left a message  with no returned phone call  a nice gal  who i assume owns the pizza place  said that the hottcakez owner was there  because her bar is near the back  and she saw them back there  the place never opened     needless to say  we didnt get any cupcakes as promised and we will never be going back  customer service is horrible  if you cant deliver  dont tell me to come back and then not answer your phone  i dont mind coming back another day  just let me know  just because im a groupon buyer  doesnt make me less of a customer  i spent money already  and havent even tried your product  and now because of you  i never will  we all get busy or things come up  its how we deal with it that counts 
awesome  authentic hawaiian dishes  excellent friendly service  they make you feel like ohana  boiled peanuts and kalbi ribs are so tender and flavorful   russ said  gina been cooking 20 years  she must be doing it right   no doubt  i agree for sure  we had a great time  russell   gina  thanks for the ono food 
we had the big daddy pancake and chemini mushroom sandwich for sunday brunch   the portion size and food taste were ok but not worth the price  bacon was very salty  service was slow and inattentive 
what a pleasant surprise  since visiting peru a few years back  ive been searching for a good peruvian restaurant here and los chicos brasa is the best and most authentic one ive had so far  i know its more knowm as a chicken place but we chose to skip its signature dish and go for the more  authentic  traditional  peruvian meals  standouts were     ceviche  strong lime taste with mild spice  and the seafood they used was really fresh   lomo saltado  really tender beef and tasty marinate   jalea  deep fried seafood goodness thats great for table sharing   arroz con mariscos  generous heaping of rice with just a generous heaping of seafood   the only thing missing was a pisco sour  which wouldve been perfect for the meal   but i guess you can never go wrong with inca cola hehe  anyway  if you want a taste of peru  highly recommend going to this place  maybe even skipping its signature chicken dish  and go straight to the classic peruvian cuisine 
we had a good server  chris  so we were surprised with the  comments about the negative service in yelp  we had the parmessan fries  ribs dinner and texas brisket sandwich  but what were truly amazing were the smores milkshake and strawberry doughnuts 
we called for a quote  a service man named dave said he was close to us   he dropped what he was doing  came over and fixed the issue in less than 10 minutes and wouldnt even take the  50 service fee   amazing customer service     were definitely customers for life  
great place   vinyl is awesome   the owner is kinda rude all the time though   other than that will always be a fan  
poor service  took 15 min to get a take out order  will never go back  they didnt even care about their customers 
simple and easy process  tech came out to my home on a weekend  allowing me to not miss work  the service took less than an hour and was done well   the  100 cash back ill get as well as the lifetime warrantee make this a great place to go 
i went to party planet  in goodyear  today looking for invitations and not only did they have the invites i was looking for they were cheaper than another party store that is going out of business and has everything 50  off   they have great customer service and are family owned and operated  they also price match competitors ads  party planet does cakes and rentals  their website has coupons for rentals  cakes  etc  i will be coming back to get the birthday cake  party supplies and balloons 
my husband and i booked a room on easter weekend  this was our first time in vegas and couldnt be happier with the stay at the jockey club  we werent sure what to expect from reviews we had seen on line because most people complained about the time share side  we never once had a run in with anyone about time share   the women at the front desk was nice  i informed her that we had never been to vegas and that we would love the opportunity to upgrade the room to a view of the bellagio fountain and she said that all the rooms with that view are book  when we came back to get our key she said she gave us the best room she could find with the view of the fountain  we really appreciated that she took the time and effort to meet our request  the room was big with a full kitchen which we did not use  bed was comfy bathroom was nice and the closet was huge with a safe  you cant beat the location  you are right next to the bellagio  cosmopolitan  and paris   the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the room is a bit outdated  i know they have rooms that have been upgraded it just depends on when you go if they are available  we had a good experience and we will book our next stay at the jockey club 
called triple b late this morning since i was tired of having issues with a temperamental garage door and remotes   i was thrilled that roderic  and his assistant  irish  would be able to come out same day for repairs   they were extremely professional  knew the exact nature of the problem  showed up when promised  gave me a good price  and the work was completed in an hour   i always try and seek out the very best repairmen   will definitely keep roderics business card taped to my fridge with the rest of the best   highly recommended and without hesitation 
these guys rock       im about to embark on my first mini curtain project   got loads of advice and even a super discount on the last few yards on a bolt of fabric   love this place   highly recommended   tons of gorgeous fabric 
excellent quality food  the sandwiches and soups are always hooked up just right  im always customizing my orders and they are always coming out exactly how i ask  i order delivery to my business and to my home  the manager joe is on top of his game he must be double checking the orders because they never come incorrectly  i highly recommend the broccoli cheese soup and the cuban press  the chocolate chip cookies are always soft and freshly baked  thanks to all the staff for making the food consistently and delivering on time  
they were clearly understaffed as the service was slow and infrequent   we came here hoping to get great steaks but were left very disappointed since we decided on a ribeye steak  supposedly a premium cut  ordered medium rare and it was served medium well  the waiter didnt bother checking with the done ness when serving probably because they always overcook their steaks  only reason why we didnt bother returning it was to avoid food wastage    on the other hand  the duck confits are perfectly cooked  will not mind going back for the duck but definitely not for their steaks  they should probably rename themselves to confit frites 
very nice bartenders and delicious drinks  loved that the douche y aspect of bars was absent 
well  this is hard to rate frankly   my man was falling off his chair practically in ecstasy over his first taste of mexican food the entire meal  so for that  they get some stars  it also has the required cheesy tex mex ambience factor and its a convenient royal mile location    now  me  i am from california  as pasty as i look  i am half hispanic  i can make pretty much anything on the menu if they sold the dang ingredients anywhere convenient in the uk for a reasonable price  mission impossible      so you can guess where this is headed  to me  this is watered down tex mex faire  to an american reader  i would liken this to something you might find in the midwest or a strip mall somewhere    not horrible  but not exactly good  definitely nowhere in the neighborhood of authentic  not even a distant cousin of authentic  and  so  not worth the price    unless you are stranded in scotland and craving something resembling mexican food and this will do  particularly  i have to say the sangria really let me down  i dont know what the other reviewers are talking about  insert mexican sad face here  it impressed the man  whod never had it before    but i found it to be not so bueno    anyhow   the bill came  it was pretty large for what would have been about 30  of that in the states  and tasted 300  better  but the man was thrilled with the experience so it wasnt a total loss 
ive flown out to vegas a couple times to see my favorite band perform here  yeah  im a dork   whatever  this place is actually really decent when it comes to huge arenas  the sound is good  the staff is good  the mgm is pretty sweet and a central location  the last time i was here  i was third row and had an absolutely amazing time   which was amplified by the fact that security  unlike many other arenas  wasnt totally up everyones butts yet still managed to handle the crowd and allow people to have fun  its all too common that people pay lots of money for great seats to a show  just to have some security guard standing on their toes for two hours  this has not been the case at the mgm either time ive been there  which gets two thumbs up 
best selection in town  employees are very helpful plus they gift  wrap  my go to store for birthdays 
nice in expensive dinner style place with decor to match  very casual and nice selection  good food and large portions with a wide variety of choices  service is a bit so so but i think our waitress just had an off day 
fast and efficient service  they came and was able to open my car in less than 15min  amazed 
cockroach in food  disgusting  they comped meal   but it wasnt worth it  im feeling queasy 
serviceable food  comparable to a decent  roach coach   hot dogs are pretty good  better than pinks on the strip though  but not bun length  chili was o k  but lacks in comparison to original tommys and even staggs canned chili  the fries were bog standard for a diner so nothing overly special  overall decent food at a reasonable price but nothing to write home about or go out of your way for 
excellent selection and pricing  i took advantage of the 1 buck or 13 for ten box box for some 90s goodness due to my daily budget but noticed the cost of his  more expensive  books were very fair  will come back when i can 
the only good thing about this place is the intimate setting and the beautiful decor  otherwise  i was disappointed  the hookah was supposed to taste like coffee  pistachio and jasmine but it all blended together into a muddy mess  the drinks were overpriced  if i dont specify a rum then give me well  dont pour me the expensive stuff  i didnt try any of the food but who goes to a hookah bar to eat anyway  all the waitstaff seemed more concerned with restocking the fridge with redbull than asking me if i wanted another drink  the absolute worst part was the music  a dj came in and started playing pussycat dolls and eminem  what is it  2005  current music played at an appropriate volume would have been nice instead of blaring hits from six year ago  i wont go back 
they have a great green curry and huge spring rolls  their beef and broccoli is just okay  i know  beef and broccoli  well  it can be great  ive had beef and broccoli thats worth talking about  anyway  the food was great and the portions were huge  i just moved to the area and im happy to find a thai place almost as good as my favorite haunts in chicago  ill definitely go back 
really chill place  good service  the name is misleading to be honest  it is more greek than cajun  still  we had a good time and will likely go back  good beer selection  we didnt try the food  maybe next time 
i will never buy food at that wendys again  fries were old and cold  and customer service was the worst ive ever seen  if everyone hungry please dont to to wendys 
the donuts were hot and ready  the smell hung in my car for hours    it was heavenly    i stopped for a quick dozen early on a saturday  the donuts were exactly as expected  hot  full of glaze  too good to eat two    the customer service could use some attention  the line crawled along  the car in front of me reversed as i was pulling up and parked to go inside  i waited  and waited  and waited  ordered a dozen glazed and crawled to the window  they needed to clarify my order by that point     ummmmm okay  i feel like had i not said  thank you  i wasnt going to hear it    you get what you get  a dozen glazed under  10 you cant expect the world 
yah not bad  hey my bed was really comfortable and i slept well  i had a room on the 29th floor overlooking the pool  i was here for a conference and many people on lower floors complained of noise from the cannon ball during the night and some sort of fan system  i like the location on the strip and its pretty convenient to get to a lot of thins  mall right across the street with higher end stores over miracle mile  fuck the miracle mile    the crowd for mystere every night was a little annoying  the bars in here arent so great  a little seedy and felt older than the hotel was  i did not like at night that there is a good fellas looking guy standing at the elevators asking for keys abrasively  nor do  i care for the almost exact looking guy guarding the pool  which by the way is in the weirdest location  you can see it from every angle of the hotel except for where the entrance actually is      its odd  gambling is so so  not the worst but not a great variety of slots  these penny slots are the biggest rip off  i want the old days with nickle slots    the hotel doesnt have any great dining but it is close to the hotels that do 
i had the lamb chops in a balsamic serrano chili reduction sauce  the chose i ordered medium rare  the plate was saturated in this sauce which was incredibly over powering  too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better quality balsamic  i had this taste in my mouth for days  it was edible but i dont feel was executed properly and for the cost i would expect that  when i told the waiter he said its not for everyone  i explained that the issue was the vinegar was over powering and if it was properly done it should be more sweet than vinegar  the lamb chops were a little over done cooked medium well ish and were and effort to cut  the tamale served with it was underwhelming at best    my friend had the ciopinno  and it was phenomenal   i was very  very jealous of his dish and he was lovely to share with me  the flavor of the broth was sensational  i could drink the broth  the seafood was quality   we had the hibiscus margaritas  which i loved    the bread served at the beginning was interesting  some i liked more than others  the jalapeno corn bread i felt just had a weird flavor  and the taste of baking soda was intense  my husband didnt seem to notice    the ambiance definitely leaves something to be desires  i feel more as if i am in some high ceiling ed cafeteria with table cloths  its not romantic or special  more of a cattle call  i think the design could have lent a little more to the intimacy and experience of enjoying the food  again  for the price i have had better for less    based on my experience and for the cost this place  i would say i expected more   the ciopinno is what saved my experience  i might try this place again if i was with a group or person who insisted on going but would not get the lamb  and most likely wouldnt seek it out again 
the place was well maintained and just difficult enough to make it fun  we went to the thief room  it had some pretty cool hi tech puzzles  i also like that they keep track of completion times for first timers so that you can compare how well you did to others 
i have rented from aoa twice now and they always take good care of me  this time i rented a specialized epic for 3 days and had a blast  the bike was in good shape and ready for me when i arrived  the staff had lots of good advice on where to ride and handed me maps to assist  cant wait to come back 
loved working with this team at h2o to go   tony and sid were amazing and very professional  had the water softener put in this past week and we already feel a difference   love having soft water again 
so  bergies produces a really great cup of coffee   i always get the toddy as it both smooth and highly caffeinated  if youre an iced coffee fiend like myself  then that should be the first thing you order    they sell a variety of baked goods if youre looking for a bite to eat with your coffee  theyre made locally  so thats always cool to hear  theyre also delicious    as for the atmosphere  i wouldnt say its prime for doing work on a laptop  bergies is actually better suited for catching up with friends or tuning out by oneself with its outdoor accommodations  its really a beautiful place 
food is fair  ordered the turkey bacon sub  will order it again  however the delivery person is the reason i am give them 2 stars  first off the drive called to confirm my location he did not identify himself i was told after saying hello    did you order a sub  drive also made it sound like i was an inconvenience to him  after we decided on a pick up location he went to the wrong spot was rude to our security desk  if you order be cautious of deliver 
kitty went beyond the call       to be fair  this is not the sort of place i would choose   i was sent here on a business trip  so i wont say much about the hotel itself  however  i was upgraded to a suite  since they mistakenly booked me into a 2 queen room instead of a king bed  an upgrade is always a nice gesture that a customer remembers      and the room was just fine  but the mattress had reached the end of the road and had a humongus sag in the center  i checked in too late to reach housekeeping  when i called the next morning it sounded like an entire day would pass before a supervisor could investigate and approve a different mattress  i had been up all night and made a desperate call to the front desk  i think  and kitty said she would do what it took to help me out  and lickety split a supervisor appeared  she immediately got what i was talking about  and within 30 minutes  a brand new  and surprisingly heavenly  mattress and a housekeeper to change the sheets  also delicious   surprisingly so   i got through to kitty about 8 45am and by 10am i was tucked in to catch up on my zzzzzzzs  though i had a sleepless first night  i was very impressed with the way in which the the problem was corrected  though the luxor appears in severe need of freshening  kitty gets 5 stars  oh  and p s  whod a thunk it  but the pyramid suite that i was in was as quiet as a library
front desk staff was rude  constant billing issues  and overpriced compared to 4 other dentists  i took the estimate sheet to  
love this place  love you guys  ive been coming here for two years and it is the best  i love the ideas of the toppings with names and how you can get everything from a fruity healthy version  to a sugary chocolaty mess to satisfy anyones cravings  im lucky you guys are ten miles away or id be there every day  where i come from crepes are a regular breakfast item  only we never thought to stuff them with ice cream  i love to have the crepe that reminds me of my childhood  filled with the awesomeness of ice cream and toppings  you guys always keep this place extra clean and the family games are a cool bonus  my daughter loves it here 
great little place  like the owners  i kind of feel bad for them as its a rough find  i looked for this place for months after heating about it  its tucked behind near the boxing place  its has outside heated seating and the meals are really good  like an old fashioned family meal place  the soup a great and we shared an baptizer  we will go back for a full dinner as this was just for a quick bite  everything tasted very fresh  good selection of bear
a nice family friendly hardware store and they always seem eager to help you 
sams club is great for certain things  i do not like how they dont water their plants and let them die  i do like the large assortment and low priced chicken   they have a large wine selection as well  gas prices are really good 
the place to go for office supplies  very handy store if you need school supplies and or office items
ok  first  the staff is so sweet  i ran in just before closing and they opened the door at least a dozen people behind me  the ladies behind the counter were super sweet  since this is my first time i have just been dying to try the chicken  it was super good   they were out of french fries so i tried the huspuppies  man are they big   the potato salad and slaw were both really good and very fresh  i just wish they were open later as if you want to pick up after work and work until 5 30  you have to run  i wish they had a hot side like collard greens or mac and cheese  but i will be back for sure  glad to see a home opened business still in business since 1962  hope they stay around for many more years  i look forward to stopping in again
food is trash  got a combo pizza  side salad   stromboli  pizza was bland  barely any flavor  undercooked  stromboli was the same no flavor  outside was done but inside the cheese wasnt melted   center was cold  saved the side salad for lunch but not expecting much at all 
so good   a slice is filling   this is a must stop on all future visits  its on the 3rd floor   not on the 2nd as i was originally told   very fast   in and out to get your food
everything ive had so far has been great  not sure about the other reviews  but i was pleased with the food and the price as well    maybe people had too high of hopes or expected abuelos or something  but i have been consistently going back here to eat    way better than filbertos and less greasy  it doesnt leave that gross feeling in your stomach like other places do
my husband and i chose this place for brunch while on vacation based on the great reviews   but it was very disappointing  the service was terrible   we sat at the bar but the bartenders were more concerned about doing dishes than helping customers  the food also took a long time to arrive once ordered  for a place called hash kitchen  the hash was underwhelming   it was dry and lacked flavor  worst of all   i ordered a virgin bloody mary  since im pregnant  and received a normal one  this is a place you can skip 
i got take out specialty pizzas and salads from here the other day for a small group   the girl who took my order over the phone was sort of underwhelming and its sort of weird that you order at a register but the pizza was very good  ill definitely get it again 
was in the area and needed some food  it was 5 min away and the reviews looked stellar so my wife and i headed over   easy to find and easy to order  staff is super friendly  there is 15 20 min wait  depending on your order  because everything is made per order  definitely  more than worth the wait   we ordered the quarter chicken with potatoes and ceasar salad   and the chicken sandwich combo  fries  drink  bottom line  everything was awesome   best chicken   salad weve had in the gta  amazingly tasty   full flavours with homemade  piri piri sauce to die for  our new goto place for portuguese chicken  a  
place is a dump  empty boxes stacked chest high in the dimly light dinning area  service is very lacking  i dont think they have the a  c on or its broke  overall place looks very dirty  cook was going to town in the back but not sure for who  need to find some good chinese food somewhere around town  help 
this place is not prepared for a decent weekend crowd  food is taking forever and the staff are in a disarray to say the least   this place is on my  steer clear  on the weekend list  although the food is good    its not that good 
fried rice is good  customer service is a little lack luster 
the korean bbq joint is by far the best  what i mean by best is the fact that the atmosphere makes it seems like youre korea with the music and videos in the 3 tvs  one thing you cannot beat is the all you can eat  especially with the three prices you can choose from  everyone is nice that works there and it does get busy at nights and the weekends  this place closely matches up to some of best korean bbq in la 
this place looks small from the outside but it is bigger in the inside  the food is very tasteful  my gf and i ordered 1 bulgolgi  pork fried rice  and chicken katsu  the portions are enough to to feed two to three people  the only down fall is the prices  overall you need to to at least try this out    reason why i put 4 stars instead of 5 i because all the tables smelt a little bit like bleach from when they wipe down the tables 
as a local now thats still getting her place in order  i was feeling under the weather and didnt have ginger  honey or lemon on hand  i wouldve whipped up my own concoction if i did but i knew it would be a good time to check out the juice standard as i had sampled it many times in the past  i was recommended bee royal and the sweet employee offered to even add honey and warm it up for me to soothe my throat  let me tell you  it was very comforting  the only thing that hurts is the price but given that its in the cosmo  thats to be expected  i would definitely return 
i agree with mio s  that breakfast is the most important meal of the day  and i will tell you that the 1  3 lb  burger with american fries  read  hash browns cooked in bacon grease  was absolutely the right way to start off my day post freakfest    its a dive with cheap  wonderfully greasy food and an old school style  short stools surround a u shaped counter  there are some tables  and you might have to work for service  but overall its friendly and perfect for preempting or sopping up those tipsy nights    the only downers  spotty hours  whenever food runs out or the owner  cook gets bored    cash only 
the outdoors  free music  good beer  good friends  wisconsin can be lovely when they arent raving football lunatics     nice amount of tables and space  right on the lake   rec  if you see abandoned pitchers  take them  you get  1 for each that you return  i saw some girl with like 11 of them     dont forget to return yours  too    vibe killas   one of the three performances the day we last went was really good  the others were actually quite terrible  at least its free  but maybe not so much when you actually want to leave    only union members can buy beer  seriously 
nothing special  being predominantly vietnamese you know what real bahn mi is   so if you come here then just only go to try something different   so its a fast take out spot  you walk in and line up to order from the screen  its divided by bahn mi  steamed bao and tacos  each with pretty much the same toppings and selections  they kinda mix in chinese  thai   and viet cuisine to the menu  so dont let the name bahn mi fool you   i ordered the 5 spice steamed bao  the bao was delicious  the 5 spice pork belly was amazing  portion was a good size  i also ordered the kimchi fries which was delicious fresh but very soggy after a few mins  it consist of fries  pulled pork  kimchi and some mayo  not too bad   one thing i do like is sadly the choice of beverages  they sell black cherry soda and specialty cokes  i know its not a big deal but it does matter to my meal   overall its ok and for me needs special cravings 
im sad that i have to give this place this rating as my experience was not great   first off  keeping in mind that this place is located on the ghetto west end  you cant expect much in terms of experience but you would at least expect the food to be great    going in it was very busy which is a good sign  i got seated at a dirty table which they came and cleaned with a napkin from the dispenser on the table  then all they did was sweep everything from the table to the floor    then they gave us the menu with a small order sheet to write our order but forgot the pen   i ordered a large pho dac biet but when the lady was bringing it she spilled half it on the floor and herself  instead of refilling the bowl and cleaning it she brought the bowl with beef and soup hanging off the edges to our table and served it this way  not only was it super messy but very uncomfortable to eat this way  if you look at the photos you will see that the lady is on the floor cleaning the mess    with her bare hands   the coffee was not drip coffee  it was done through their espresso machine and took them 2 mins to make and serve   then when the bill came  i placed my card on the tray and said they only take cash  no signs were displayed of this  good thing i understood a bit of vietnamese because i over heard them telling to the rest of the staff loudly that  this guy did not bring cash     and  chuh oy he should be more prepared     how the f    was i supposed to know they took cash only if they didnt even display a sign about it  luckily for me the convenience store had an atm machine next door   other then the service and experience  the food phone was pretty good  hot  big portion and tasty    overall i would give 2 out of 5 and will never come back again 
not a big fan of this mcdonalds  they cant stick with one structure  its either two lines or one line  then theres another line for order pick up which people waiting in line get mixed up in  part of it is once you walk in it is one aisle the merges directly to the cashier  messes things up   they have recently upgraded their screens so now its super high tech and very appealing  only problem with this is now they are showing mcdonalds ads which takes the customer away from the actual menu for about 20 seconds  so imagine you get to the cashier and you need to make a decision on your order but have to wait for the ad to go by before you see the menu and then you are limited in time before the ad pops up again  just not efficient at all   they have a separate kids zone which i take advantage of if you want peace and want to avoid the crowd  yes its or kids but when kids are in school and youre there during lunch then ill endure caillou for 20 mins and eat at peace   restaurant is clean and drinks are self serve  which is awesome for refills  not all locations have implemented this yet   i would say this place is neutral   nothing special about it 
ive tried my fair share of poke since it started up a few years back and north poke has topped the list for me    location  located at the tip of chinatown in a new trendy area at the baldwin strip  walking distance from kensington market   food  i typically say clear of spam but this would be the only time where spam is acceptable  the terayaki musubi makes you wonder why spam was ever packaged in a can    they have included the option for you to have tasters where you can try 3 poke for around  15  great way to feel it out before picking your main choice   theres no doubt that my favourite bowl is salmon   waimea poke    yelpers get perks for eating here    just make sure you ask what the current deals are    overall  my latest craze    try it   you wont regret it 
without a doubt one of the biggest bars in toronto   located in the heart of the sports and entertainment district  across from the air canada centre and down the street from rogers centre  you cant help but want to visit this bar    this bar has two floors  25 000 square foot of spacious seating area with always a view of some sort of event  this bar has 199 hd tvs plus a 39 foot massive hd tv center stage making it perfect for pay per view events such as ufc and superbowl    their food and drink inventory is massive with 126 draught taps  14 wing flavours  and 11 gourmet burgers  being located across from the air canada centre  they have full right to take advantage of pricing  draught beers can range from  7  10  wings are  14   28   56 depending if you want 1  2  1 or 2 pounds and burgers are around  15  so this is definitely one of those places if you have a few bucks to throw around for a night of game watching and beer then go for it  otherwise youll come out broke   the restaurant is attached to office and condo complex as well as the underground path making your connection between locations easier  warmer and dryer  if you feel like pre drinking then you can always hit up the lcbo connected to the same building and then go buy yourself a raptors jersey at the real sports store   overall  id come back any time as long as theres something entertaining to watch and mainly because of the selection of beers on tap   try out it  you wont be disappointed 
a great healthy dessert that actually tastes good   ive been here twice now  and neither time was i disappointed  the flavors are true and really do taste like ice cream  so far ive had the egg nog and a toffee flavor  and both were delicious   and the spoon is gold 
ive been going to big wong for at least a decade  even in the old location  and am very sad to hear that they are closing  closed   gina and the rest of the staff have always treated me like family and i cant believe that its going to be gone   in all that time  i have never ever had a bad dish  ever  ive eaten practically the entire menu and visited so often when i lived closer that they would put in my appetizer order before i even got a table  many of my friends were introduced to this place by me  and when visiting from as far away as alaksa would ask me to go there when in town   if they do reopen somewhere else  ill be 1st in line for some paper wrapped chicken 
the food here does not exactly stand out to me as  delicious and unforgettable  however  the restaurant is pretty much across the street from where i live  the breakfast is very typical of what you could make at home  the restaurant is dimly lit so it great for hangover mornings  the service is usually pretty outstanding  the staff is very attentive and quick to bring you anything you want  theyve even got jokes 
this is not a place i chose to go to because i heard the food was great  i went to this place to grab some food before attending the soundgarden  nin concert  it was a convenient place to go to for food and it also has a bar  i went on a saturday and most the people there were also there for the concert  i ordered the morning glory burger with sweet potato fries  i think i got lucky with my burger because it was so delicious  it was everything i love about breakfast  my favorite meal  served on top of a juicy burger  the sweet potato fries were pretty badly overcooked so i did not enjoy those  the food is extremely pricy for burgers  but not uncommon for food prices on the strip  service is pretty slow and it is somewhat like in n out where you order  then wait for them to call your number and you grab your food  i would have given only 3 5 stars but yelp doesnt give the option 
my family and i have been coming here for 30 years  family owned and operated by two generations of vets  father and son team doctors mel and dan bramley  their prices are quite reasonable and they definitely care about animals and people alike 
i am definitely planning on trying to become a regular here   every week i find myself talking about how i need to change my eating habits and start eating right    more like every morning  but im trying to make myself feel better here   well  greens and proteins is definitely a step in the right direction   i met a girlfriend here one afternoon for a quick lunch and i was definitely in love   we both got smoothies and split one of their breakfast options   i was definitely satisfied by the end of our meal     i got their acai smoothie and i loved it   it wasnt as thick as some smoothie places make their smoothies and i was definitely happy about that   it was the perfect flavor and consistency   and  it filled me up   now  im a hungry  hungry hippo  so i usually need a lot more than a smoothie to satisfy my hunger   but not here   my appetite was completely satisfied and i had to force myself to split the frittata with my friend   which was also delicious      this is definitely an amazing healthy alternative in the area and i cant wait to go back and try even more 
nothing drives a girl more crazy than a bad cut    okay  maybe a chipped nail is worse    but you get the point   elements salon will not disappoint    although i have only been in the salon three times now  i have always enjoyed my visits   when i first moved to vegas i was extremely nervous about letting someone new touch my hair  i had been with my previous hair dresser in nj for about 10 years    well  a trusted co worker suggested elements and so off i went    adventuring into the abyss of unknown highlights and hair cuts   the first time i went  i kept it simple with my usual style  highlights and a trim    i worked with jeanine and i loved her   she is so friendly and kept me chatting and entertained throughout my whole visit   she took amazing care of me   she made sure to double and triple check everything i wanted to make sure  i was getting exactly the looked i wanted     after my first test run i was ready to take it up a notch with jeanine on my next visit   since the summer was coming around  i wanted to try something fun   so  i went with a purple ombre   nothing is more fun and out there as that  am i right   i loved it   she did a great job blending it and keeping it subtle for my first time around with a deep color on my ends   i loved it so much i went back toad more and have the purple go up a little higher to make it more noticeable   i love the purple so much that im pretty sure itll be staying around long after summer is over     ive only ever worked with jeanine so i cant really attest to the other stylists  but everyone is always extremely friendly when i come in and everyone makes it an enjoyable experience  this will definitely be my new place while i live in vegas 
four words     out of body experience   my homegirl britney has definitely still got it   we went to her show as a birthday party for my bestie   there were 8 of us in one of the back rows and we partied all night   it was an amazing way to celebrate my main girls birthday     when you walk in  there are glass cases with britney exhibits  costumes from iconic music videos  and its awesome to walk by and get to see the outfits we all wished we could rock whenever britney came out with a new music video   if you get the souvenir cups  your refill drinks are discounted  which is great when youre a group of girls lookin to party    no  britney doesnt sing live     but lets be honest    you run around a huge stage  dancing your ass off and tell me if you can physically handle singing   most of us are out of breath walking up two flights of stairs    let alone running around a stage trying to entertain a huge amount of people   i dont think she should lose stars for not singing live    and if you went to this show expecting her to     you might be a little naive    or you really just dont know what a britney experience consists of     i had a blast and loved every second i was there   we may have been a tad obnoxious  but we were giddy little girls excited to see britney slay  and slay she did 
front desk staff is nice  cant beat the  10 per month price  the main workout floor is is clean but dingy due to age  scuffed paint  gaping holes in plastic walls  labels that fall off their dumbbells and dont get replaced so you have to guess how heavy the weights are  dreary colors  black and gray   the other patrons are all nice  i could deal with the downsides  but plan to switch gyms for this reason alone  their music blares so loudly  i cant hear my own music  nobody wants to endure someone elses unpleasant music played loudly in a terrible acoustic setting  the front desk staff claims they are not allowed to adjust either the content or the volume  so the only control you have is to deafen yourself with your own music or leave  i just want to workout in peace  i have bailed on several workouts because i cant think straight and just get annoyed with the noise  its everywhere including in the dressing rooms  its a gym  guys  not a music venue  turn it down  or better yet  turn it off 
this is my new sushi spot  i am a big fan of the volcano roll  and theyre pop stickers are to die for  the staff is very friendly it is a relaxed environment  i have been eating at this place for the past 2 weeks almost 3 times a week  it is seriously that good  i tried miso soup for the first time and it was delicious  plus they gave me extra seaweed but they can hold the tofu  i like the fact that they have a rotating happy hour menu so you get a chance to try a lot of rolls  i definitely recommend trying the vegas roll and the volcano roll 
after reading the yelp reviews for the yardbird southern table and bar i decided to make a reservation  the reviewers were spot on  this is a great southern fare restaurant with a warm friendly staff    our waiter recommended the chicken n watermelon waffles    36 00  my husband and i added buttermilk biscuits   7 00  and crispy brussel sprouts   10 00  to our order  the fried chicken is served with spiced watermelon and a vermont cheddar cheese waffle  they kick it up a notch by adding a side of honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup  the flavor combination of this meal is incredibly delicious  the chicken is 100 percent natural with no steroids or hormones and brined for 27 hours before serving  i loved the biscuits and the brussel sprouts did not disappoint 
just wanted to give a shoutout to casey and his service team   took great care of me came in for an airbag recall as well as ecu update recall  also asked them to look at a door handle that wasnt working  casey was super reasonable and got it fixed up for a fraction of what i was expecting to be quoted  thanks again guys 
ordered the sushi sampler which included a salad   excellent for what i wanted  traditional more suitable for me  large pieces of fish and very fresh  service was awesome 
great food  excellent service and the kitchen looks as clean as ive seen  the portions are quite big and their rice and lamb are always delicious 
haru sushi is worth the time    the biggest draw is the speed and the price   you can be eating as fast as you can take a plate off of the conveyor   weve fed two people regularly for  20 each time and we leave full   the quality of the sushi is average   we have always found the service to be very helpful and timely   we will be returning often 
amazing   lost of choice and staff are very friendly 
lived at uoft new college  this was a frequent spot for everyone on residence for good reason   pizza slizes are huge and always crispy thin   great for late night snack thats not too damaging on your wallet 
the platinum did not disappoint  it was everything as advertised   it reminded me of a w hotel  my worry was since it was off strip and a non gaming hotel that finding a taxi would be a problem   it wasnt at all   they either have people waving taxis in or they can call for one for you   i didnt have to wait  more than 5 minutes on a friday or saturday night   i didnt get a chance to dine at the restaurant  but did enjoy lunch poolside  chopped salad  which was quite yummy   since its a condo  hotel usually i expected the clientele to be older or families   but i think the word is out and that its slightly changing   as evidenced by the several bachelorette parties and young women i saw poolside  ummm   where was i   oh yeah   definitely check out the platinum  
had dinner there last week and the food was amazing   ordered the three course meal and loved everything   the bartender mixed up a surprise drink and i was not disappointed   i would recommend crudo to anyone who loves great food 
this place never fails to please my wife and i   always top notch food and the service is always friendly and prompt  we will not hesitate to drive out of our way to visit when we are in the cleveland area   just love it       
have to take these guys to court    is giving them a zero star an option   i have been without ac in half my house for a month and a half   it took sending out 4 of their own guys to come to the conclusion that they would pay no more than   500 for a  3500 repair   and that was after i had to get two outside opinions on my own dime and provide 2 years of maintenence proof   even after all that was done   they continue to be rude and unethical    even though i have a recording of robert telling my fiance the unit would be covered in full where anthony and kevin said nothing will be covered    expect a slap in the face  500 
great waitresses  enough said        go for the monday specials  definitely worth it 
im obsessed with buffets and ayce  and red pot is definitely on my top 5 favorite ayce places in las vegas because  1  they have seafood  2  they have sliced meat  3  they have veggie  4  they have soup  and 5  what more do you need in life    food  you start off with choosing two broths that are set up ying yang style at your table  i highly recommend the sour tomato because its flavorful enough to eat with your food and drink with your noodles  yet not overpowering  we also got the  mongolian herbal broth but that was way too plain  it tasted like water soaked in some of the basic veggies from the fridge  red pot offers a vast variety of seafood  from clams to fish balls   pork  lamb shoulder  beef  chicken slices in the freezer  and vegetables  from bamboo to bok choy   plus  two counters worth of sauces to mix a concoction to your taste    price  my parents and i were so impressed with how cheap it was because we definitely ate our moneys worth and more  its  22 per person for lunch and 10  off for checking in yelp  dinner is  35 per person and 15  off discount with yelp  if you think ayce sushi or kbbq is great  try hot pot    service  the service was mediocre  i had to ask for my drink to be refilled twice  and they never check on us  keep in mind  only four other tables were occupied besides us and my group came right at 11 am  luckily  the food in the fridges  freezers were always stocked  and everything seemed clean and not cluttered   so thats a plus   overall  highly recommend  now that the weather is getting colder  hot pot is the best way to enjoy a meal with family and friends  its affordable  delicious  and a fun hands on lunch or dinner experience  im taking 1 star away because some of their items were super frozen and not the freshest  and their soup choices are disappointing 
im not exactly sure what yunnan food is  but im very impressed  their portions are quite large and everyone at our table had extra to take home    i got the rice noodle in hot and sour soup  it was flavorful with just the perfect amount of spices  it is hard to explain  youll have to taste it yourself because of how unique it is  my sister got the braised beef noodle soup and she said the broth was also flavorful and not too salty  the beef was tender and melts on your tongue  both dishes came with a generous amount of vegetables    their service was amazing  they were attentive  and the food came out fast  no complaints here 
first off  they have really bad customer service  i came here twice  and both times i was not greeted and the staff did not bother to make any sort of conversation with me  i came in on a slow day  and a simple   hi hows your day  would not kill you   second  they seem to be understaffed  only one worker all day  and it is surprising since they are located in a busy business complex right off the freeway  so if the person before you ordered 4 drinks  prepare to wait awhile    third  the staff seem very inexperienced and have no knowledge on supplements or the different smoothies on the menu    on a brighter note  the prices are decent  i paid  6 22 for a 32 ounce 
my parents and i ordered the chefs special ramen  curry ramen  and miso ramen    out of the 3  i like the curry ramen the best  it was the most flavorful and had the best spices in the soup  the noodle to soup ratio was perfect  but i wish there was more substance   whether it be more vegetables or more meat  something about the meal felt missing  aside from that  the service was quick and we got our food within 10 minutes  the prices are decent  about  8 and up per bowl    personally  there are better ramen places in town like monta ramen or ramen sora that have a more milky  unique tasting broth 
ive never tasted and experience such unique pasta options in my life    i am impressed with how many types of noodle they offer  the various sauces  and the overall menu selection  for noodles  they have the basic spaghetti and fettuccine  as well as interesting ones like butternut squash and spinach ravioli  for the sauces  they have red  pink  green  creamy white  and seafood  plus specialities pastas  a kids menu  and desserts    best of all  they have a lunch special for  9 95 that includes a noodle and sauce of your choice  a drink  and garlic bread  dine in or take out  you must try the fettuccine with the basil pesto creamy sauce 
dr  k is the best  i have taken my dog to many other vets and he has been the most caring  helpful one yet  he takes the time to really get to know your pet and leaves plenty of room for questions and to discuss what your options are  i really wish i would have found him sooner    the staff is equally as nice and compassionate  you can tell they enjoy their job and treat your fury family member just as their own  the office is also very clean  thanks  guys 
ew  not the best mexican food  the plates are too greasy and the guacamole tastes like it came from a can  even the chips were meh  i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone 
bow wow meow went beyond my expectations   we dropped our 4 year old german shepherd off yesterday for his very first grooming session  we adopted him months ago but we had never given him a bath  we were a bit wary of leaving him for the grooming because we havent boarded him or been apart from him since we brought him home  but the staff was so friendly and understanding  it took about 4 hours or so  but when we picked our buddy up  we were so excited how beautiful he looked  he smelled amazing  his coat was so soft and he just looked amazing  the staff was so sweet to tell us how well he did and they really put our nerves at ease  we will definitely be coming back for our next bath  thank you bow wow meow  
i used to work here maybe 8 years ago when i was in highschool   i recently tried this place as i was in the area but cant recommend this place     the place was empty and we ordered the chicken cutlet and fried udon to go  we could hear the employees being unsure of what goes in the takeout box  which didnt really inspire confidence in the place   as for the taste  it was nothing special  eatable but not enough to make me wantto come back for more   wouldnt recommend this place unless you were in the neighborhood and really want to eat japanese  korean and cant go elsewhere
the worst dining experience ive ever experienced   so much so that im typing this review mid dinner   service from the start has been bad   only received 1 menu between 2 people took forever for drinks and the waitress to take our order    i dont blame her though    she was overworked and the other waiters looked like they didnt know what they were doing    ordered poutine as appetizer  fried were so tough to chew that it seemed they were fried twice   they also forgot the bacon  chive alioli   the cobb salad was missing the dressing   chicken ripped when it should diced   overdry chicken   asked the waiter for dressing and he never came back   at least the seafood trio was good that it saved the dinner from being a total disaster   i would seriously avoid this location   in fact  this location could have ruined pickle barrel for me   ps  we talked to the manager and he took off the poutine and salad and offered us a dessert   that did made up for the dinner and we appreciated the managers consideration 
i called them regarding the status of my phone after they fixed it    the review i have written previously is below by clicking on the reviews that are not recommended   the employee had a bad attitude and i felt like his attitude was  they fixed it once so the problems that are starting to occur from them fixing it is not their problem anymore   i sent an email showing the damages and told them to reply   after several weeks  they have not replied   i have moved on and will use a more reputable store to fix my phone 
had a fabulous meal in the new restaurant and this young man sean recommended such wonderful suggestions we had to try  the food was great    the service was awesome    so nice to have such wonderful service to match the food   thanks sean for a great lunch and we will be back   
i was lucky enough to eat at the cracked truck in the food truck oasis at bonnaroo    there are few things i like more in this world than a perfectly cooked egg and i know im gonna love a truck that makes this humble food their star ingredient  i did what i had to do and ordered the goy vey  bacon  hard salami  hash brown and a fried egg with sweet and spicy cream cheese on a ciabatta roll   this was glorious and for sure the best breakfast for dinner ive had in a long time  the sweet and spicy cream cheese made this not your regular run of the mill breakfast sandwich  the only downfall was the hash brown was fairly thin and hard to discern amongst all that fluffy bread 
this place looked very good so we decided to come in and buy a few goodies  after we selected our chocolates we were ready to pay  so i was going to pay with a gift card and the cashier said that it was declined  which i though it was very weird  so i gave her a credit card and she said it was declined again   by this time i was loosing my patience  how can 2 different cards be declined  but i said ok ill use my husbands debit card and guess what  declined  so i just decided not to get the chocolates  too bad they looked so good  that shop either has to fix their register or they can get a new cashier 
everytime we go to las vegas we make sure we go to ellis island  its cheap and delicious  once we wen for breakfast before 11 am and we got steak and eggs for only 4 99  the steak was delicious and a good size  we have been there for bar b q and their chicken and ribs are also great and not to expensive  make sure you get their rewards card and you will get good dinner deals too  i highly recommend it 
on a recent trip to las vegas i was able to stay at the cosmopolitan hotel   this was my first visit to this hotel but i had seen it featured on various tv shows over the past couple years   as the cab pulled under the garage space  i knew i was in the right place  it was just like on tv with the lines of limos pulled in front of the entrance doors     as i walked inside  i noticed quickly how updated and clean the lobby area was   i was quickly greeted in the check in line and by a staff member who was directing people to the open check in desks   i had a few min  wait before it was my turn but its to be expected in lv   at check in i was promptly given my keys and was pointed to the west tower elevators  this is the nicest of all marriott properties i have ever stayed at     first let me tell you about my pillow top mattress  this is possibly the most comfortable hotel mattress i have ever slept on   it might even be better than the bellagio beds which i am a big fan of   the bathroom was huge and the glass shower on one side and a tub on the other   the room was fully upgraded and i enjoyed my view of the bellagio fountains from my room   there are many bars at this property and tons of machines for gambling   the entire place is well kept and very clean   the cosmo is centrally located on the strip so no matter where you want to go  its quick to walk to most places   it was nice to be able to walk to new york new york and caesars without tiring myself out too much      my only complaint is the lack of casual dining restaurants   i was looking for some type of casual sports bar to sit down and have a quick lunch at  but everything seemed a bit too fancy for me   i ended up eating at a different hotel but it was a quick walk away   i would stay here again in a heartbeat    i really like this hotel and cant wait to visit again soon 
go here not pho an hoa  this is truly the best pho in charlotte   the broth is incredibly flavorful and much better than their busy neighbor 
do not take your car here for service   awful customer service   i purchased a jeep grand cherokee about 10 months ago  they called me to bring my car in for a recall  i scheduled an appointment  i showed up to the appointment and waited for 2 1  2 hours in their uncomfortable waiting area  when i inquired about how much longer my car would be  they stated they hadnt even looked at it  after i complained they did something in 20 minutes and said the rest could be completed at a later date  i also at the time of scheduling this appointment told them about a side panel that came off on the highway while driving  the panel is by my driver door  i asked if it could be replaced  this is a brand new car  i dont think parts of it should be coming off  the same panel on the passenger side is lose  they informed me they do not do body work there and would have to be sent to a body shop to fix  they would take pictures  send them to jeep to ok the repair  when the part comes in i would drop it off at prestige and they take it to the body shop for repair  they informed me i will be without a car for 2 days  a few days later i received a call from prestige instructed to take my jeep to an infinity dealer for an estimate  i did this over 2 weeks ago  no one has contacted me since  when i called infinity to see if they heard from jeep they said they would call me back in 20 minutes  that was 4 days ago  no call back  i contacted jeep customer service  told them the situation  they give you a case manager  the woman i was assigned to was named sherill  she was not helpful in the least bit  she seemed to side with jeep and told me some parts can take up to 6 months  she asked if i would be happy if i was provided a car while mine is being fixed  that is better than being with no car but i dont understand why i need to give them my car for days for a 3 hour repair  the manager at infinity stated that is the maximum amount of time my car would take  i asked to have another case manager since sherril and i were not agreeing  this is going to take another business day  this is what you get for an  800  month car payment at prestige 
yes  falasca closed a few months ago  but the same guy  allesandro  has opened quattro e quattr8 in the same location   same great square pizza   lovely italian food   warmer surroundings   worth a try 
ah brunch   a favourite with my wife particularly   six of us had a delightful time at celestin yesterday   theres an overall french feel to the place   great table   very good service   wonderful croissants   properly cooked omelettes  i e   runny    the best omelettes used to be at didier    celestin has been added to our brunch list 
if i could give this zero stars  i would  the wings were tough and dried out  all the sauce had run out of the box and into the plastic delivery bag  what a mess  onion rings were greasy and cold   salad was edible  hard to totally screw up a salad   i threw away all but the salad  sad 
this location is hit or miss  theyll either completely mess up my order and give me a free drink or get it perfect  i usually go to the one across and if i was in a rush i would come here  if you go inside theyre a lot slower paced than the location across the street 
i hit a median and caused some serious damage to the frame and engine cradle of my 2011 camero   my normal body shop went out of business   i was referred to mark webster at acc in chandler   i couldnt be happier with the results  she runs and looks like new   they really took care of me and my car   mark made sure i knew exactly what was going on with the repairs   extremely professional and super clean shop 
so we tried this taco place just because we wanted something quick and taco truck style food  i was blown away buy the taste of the food  my daughter ordered the street tacos and i had the nachos  both were delicious and much more tasty than expected  priced a little high but definitely worth the price 
fabulous work    randy from anthem window cleaning came to the house today and thoroughly cleaned all my windows  inside and out  i am thrilled at the work they did and my windows have never looked so clean  i highly recommend anthem for anyone that needs window cleaning   they are true professionals delivering superb service at a very reasonable price  
back again for work and had some free time  decided to have a pint at todd english p u b  sat at the bar and learned something new  they have a 7 second challenge  if you drink a pint in 7 seconds without spilling too much you get it for free  they have sand timers welded on the bar just for that purpose    the bar tender was very accommodating and helped me chose a yummy red ale  friendly with everyone but not intrusive    this is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to relax with a beer while in vegas 
ive taken several items to magic tailor  and ive been really happy every time  while of course they do a good job with simple things like hemming pants  ive also been really impressed with some more complicated jobs  such as completely taking apart the top half of a dress to take in the shoulders without distoring the pattern of the beading   reasonable prices  and very reliable service   he can be a bit inapproriately flirtatious  but as long as ive humoured him ive never experienced any of the negativity and insults that other reviewrs mentioned  id rather smile patiently at this guy who does a great job than take my clothing to someone who might not do it as well  
casa mia is the only life left in an otherwise deserted strip mall at 136th and via linda in scottsdale   the fact that it has survived when everything around it has died is a testament to the quality of the food and service   the pasta is excellent   my favorite dishes are the seafood pasta and the homemade sausage   my wife enjoys the pasta bolognaise and several of the veal dishes  everything appears to be home made and that takes extra time so expect to pay more then you would expect   as an example a moderately sized serving of pasta is  20 with most of the entrees in the  20  30 price rage   so if you want to splurge a bit on some of the best italian food in the valley  go to casa mia 
horrible horrible experience  switched to t mobile from sprint and had my phone ported over  it kinda worked for about 16 hours   i say kinda because the folks at the store forgot to set the phone up to access lte and receive mms messages had to spend nearly an hour with a phone support person to get that to work  after 16 hours my phone quite working saying i had a sim card error so i went back to the store  after spending about 2 minutes with someone from tech support they insisted my phone was the problem and insisted i needed a new one   i knew i was getting hosed but i desperately needed a phone so i bought a new one and made the mistake of trading in my old one  despite the fact that i was a new customer  had just paid off my phones on sprint  and had service that lasted less than 24 hours they refused to cut me a break or make any concessions    they insisted  we are a franchise store our hands are tied    they obviously did not care about the financial impact  wasted time  or aggravation caused by my decision to business with them    to make matters worse when i left the store they had neglected to configure the phone to make phone calls so i had to go back  i did more research after i got home and found out there was some sprint software on the phone i needed to disable but by then it was too late because i had traded in my phone  you would of thought if i could figure it out they could as well but go figure    i then direct messaged t mobile  on twitter and found the service amazing   they listened  seemed to care about what i had gone through  and seemed interested in keeping me as a happy customer   they were great   i also learned how to tell a company t moble store from a franchise   if you go to the store locator any store with a number next to it is a company store   based on the fact that these folks hid behind the fact that they were a franchise to provide horrible service i will only go to company owned stores in the future 
brought home some take out ribs   figured i needed to do it quick because every other restaurant hat has been in this location has closed up not to long after opening   have to say the ribs were meaty  the meat was tender  the sauce was tasty   hope they stay in business long enough for a return visit 
everyone should go to binkleys at least one   you should go at least as much for the experience as you do for the food   we tried the 4 course tasting menu with wine paring and it was quite enjoyable   they made a production out of each of the courses as well as when the wine steward presented each of the wines   in addition to the for courses they presented  served does not seem an appropriate word to use  several interesting small appetizers before and after each of the main courses   the fine china  the fine crystal  the  the linen napkins  the personalized menus  all made it quite an evening   as far as the food goes this is a foodies paradise   the menu is unlike any you will find anywhere else and the way the food was presented was very creative   it was almost like going to a food art museum    the main courses looked and tasted great   im glad we did it   why only 4 stars you ask   because i dont think we will be going back   i am not the person who watches a show  no matter how great it is  more then once   when you separate the show from the food you find that the show is what is the most impressive and i have already seen it   the food and wine alone do not justify the  150 per person it costs and since i have already seen the show it is no longer worth it to me   that said you need to go at least once because it is a total experience you will not forget 
service  a  location  a   ballantyne prices  b  options  menu   a  food  a  what a wonderful place    this is something that ballantyne needs a little bit more of   we are lacking good breakfast spots   what makes toast so unique is their menu and service   its not just the typical greasy breakfast spot that rushes you in and out   you have healthy options if you need them and some extremely delicious dessertish breakfast choices   like numerous stuffed french toast options and omelettes galore    the tomato avocado cheese omelette was superb   big and fluffy with all fresh ingredients   the wife and i will definitely be back and will probably bring some friends     enjoy    ian m 
nearly everything about this restaurant was brilliant   the food  the service  the enormous salad bar   so many different kinds of succulent meats were brought to our table all night   i just couldnt say no to anything   then   more meat came and they were wrapped in bacon   who doesnt love bacon   then swordfish   then chicken   although the food was amazingly good   the service was what really stood out   for a restaurant that doesnt really require a whole lot out of the servers  they amazed me   our waiter had extensive knowledge of the food and it preparation   the only issue that i had with the restaurant was the cost   it is very expensive   so  just be prepared to drop some dough   seriously  though     come hungry   enjoy    ian m 
thats right   im writing about a wendys   well   when you impress me on all levels  this is what you get   well done wendys   food came out looking like it does in the commercials and ever so fast   the staff was friendly and experienced   annnnnnndd it was delicious   enjoy  ps  i love you chocolate frosty  ian m 
hello qc home cookin    i love local spots that break me away from my beloved chain restaurants   dresslers is that upscale local flavor that fits in perfectly in midtown     inside is very classy and refined  while outside is picturesque and has views of the skyline   it can get a little pricey when you include alcohol but such is the way of a worthy restaurant   the entrees are rich and sized proportionally to what you should eat   not the  american  feed bag size platter   its just right   my favorite dinner was the shrimp and lobster linguini   you will love it and the staff is very helpful if you have any questions about the menu   trust me  you will leave happy    enjoy  ian m 
if the weather cooperates  its such a beautiful venue to attend for concerts   my wife and i went to a needtobreathe concert in the evening and it was simply gorgeous   we sat pretty close on the left in the seats but we were able to walk around and take it all in   there really isnt a bad spot anywhere   even from the lawn in the back  you could see the stage clearly     the bathrooms were state of the art and very clean at the beginning of the day and  as expected  worsened as the night went on   plenty of stalls and overall well designed   also  there were numerous concessions stands and never any long lines to deal with   that was huge   the only problem     the cost   waters were  5 and beers were  12   whoa   other than that    it was awesome   enjoy   ian m 
they feed my family frequently   often greets me with familiarity and friendliness   great variety of selections of vietnamese food   i love their   bun bo  bun tam bi nuoc dua  pho tai bo vien  banh xeo  mi xao don  tom rang muoi  goi cuon  cha gio  cari ga  hu tieu xao  canh chua ca thac lac  mi dac biet kho  mi hoanh thanh  i cant think of all the food  they have so much   d   thanks for feeding my family     d
buffet bliss   i came here with the recommendation of fellow yelper rose v  and my experience was super content  bacchanal buffet boasts high quality meals from almost all cuisine backgrounds  and i wish i had a second stomach to try them all  their asian cuisine was so so but i dont expect every single station to be a hit  italian  seafood  chinese  sushi  carved meats  breakfast items    i gotta eat them all  their dessert section also tasted as amazing as it looked  this place is a little more pricey than they other buffets but its certainly well worth the cost   aside from the awesome food and ambiance  the service is decent  one thing that puzzled me was the wait to get a table  i came for lunch with a friend  and it was not packed at all  though we were in front  they seated other 3 and 4 tops that were in line behind and to the sides of us  i was kind of confused  but the awesome meal made up for it  perhaps they wanted to induce increased hunger in their patrons so theyd eat more    i have no qualms with that 
this place definitely deserves five stars  the service was great and the food was phenomenal  the best omelette ive ever had  our server victoria did an awesome job our drinks never went unfilled and our food came out very quick  we will definitely return 
great place to roll  one of the best bjj spots in vegas by far   i try to get over there every time i am out in vegas   robert is a legend in bjj  hes has won so many titles i dont even know what they all are    if you are out in las vegas i highly suggest getting your roll on here 
great local spot even tourist can have fun near the strip  i take all my friends when theyre in town and everybody has a great time  grace staff great drinks good atmosphere 
ok food poor service the two downtown are so much better the wait is always very long for everything and its not even really a bar very disappointed in this spot i love the one on 9th street
the service was really good  i had the shrimp tacos which were good  but small  i also had a margarita which nice and strong  i might be back to try the trash can nachos
i had never heard of this place until yesterday  decided to try them out  ordered the italian and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was  i thought that maybe the zesty italian vinaigrette was bit too zesty at first but it quickly envelopes your taste buds 
the appointments i have had with this office and the one on southern have been top notch  i gave them only three stars  because dealing with their billing departments has been an absolute nightmare  so far i have been transferred 3 times  put on hold 3 times  and on the phone for a 40 minutes with no resolution  i guess they dont want to get paid  it appears that each office does its own billing  hence i overpaid one account and underpaid the other  wth 
expensive but quick and easy  no one to grease up the interior because they dont make you get out  the lift was broken so unable to do a tire rotation  just say no    they will always upswell so use your best judgement 
this gym has all kinds of machines and the facility is pretty nice and clean  theres a plenty of treadmills but i think they need to increase the number of other machines like stairmasters  i havent been to any of their workout class but i know they have one at least once a day in a room on the side  i wouldnt recommend going there some time between 4 to 8 because thats when everyone gets off from work and    you wont be able to find a machine to use haha
it was my favorite boutique before i met your employee michele  she is the rudest person that i met  second time she treated us like we own her  first time i thought maybe she had problems on this day but no she always rude  unprofessional and unpleasant person  you better send her on training how to say hello and to smile to people  if its not help fired her  cause she spoiled all the impression of such a great shop  its time to extend my executive card  but im not sure do i want it 
i have to travel to vegas each year on business and this hotel is great   it is right off the strip  does not have a casino you have to walk through to get to your room  and has huge suites with balconies that open to the outside   you can actually get fresh air   it is spotless and has a great room service menu and full kitchen to store your leftovers   the pool deck is a nice spot to hang out and relax after a busy day 
after nye my wife and i went to babystacks to get breakfast  while we were waiting outside  the owner  albert  showed up and asked if we wanted something to drink  he was technically closed for the the holiday but made an exception for us   we ordered the honeydew slush and it was incredibly refreshing   special thank you to albert for opening  thats amazing customer service 
i placed an order for 12 signs 3 weeks ago  i still do not have my signs  i went to the store to pickup a sample of the sign ordered 3 weeks ago and had to wait 40 minutes to be acknowledged  at no point in time did anyone greet me or say we will be with you in a minute    this is the last order i ever give to this company  lesson learned 
lived in las vegas over 20 years first time ever going in to this establishment tonight must say the chips salsa and bean dip were fantastic    i also had a mango margarita which was delicious as well as the carnitas dinner which was also fantastic  my husband ordered a combo dinner with a pork tamale beef taco and chili releno also very very good  the staff was super friendly and courteous and welcoming i would definitely recommend this restaurant for food and service
verrrry cool  if you are in pittsburgh  definitely check this place out  even if you were never a big fan of andy warhol or arent familiar with his work  this museum is very enlightening  to learn about a mans path to becoming an amazing artist is a great gift  on the bottom floor  they offer a studio where you can create your own warhol esque art  fun way to decompress all that information you learned while looking through his paintings  drawings  films and live art  also  go take some warhol esque selfies in that photo booth on the first floor  just do it  instagram it  be a part of the experience 
best buffet i have ever been to  great variety of all kinds of food plus their prime rib is divine  p   but dont come here on thanksgiving the line gets wild      or any holiday actually  im sure it is the same but if you do  make sure you tip well because these people most likely work every holiday     i would call ahead just in case to see how long the line is  depending on the day  time 
i love maxs    i have been to many locations and i was happy to find one in las vegas      the customer service is really friendly and efficient plus i just love filipino hospitality  they are super welcoming and you cant find that everywhere nowadays     the food is always on point my family and i ordered a few bigger plates so everyone could share   fried chicken  sinigang  noodles   we were super full and happy after our meal 
the service   5 stars   ive always been a fan of yardhouse but this location is now my favorite   bartenders to the manager  i didnt get his name but he gave the scoop on the masters golf championship     got me watching golf       everyone was were so friendly  anways  the layout is contemporary  great view out door seating  great food  i had the  poke stack    and excellent customer service 
for the price  the hotel is good  i was really frustrated  we have a van and there was absolutely no parking at the hotel or anywhere near by  we had to drive our van to hooters hotel and take a taxi back to the linq you cant run a hotel and not offer parking options  we had to take taxis everywhere since our van was parked so far away  the wifi does not work and we still had to pay for the resort fee  when we were playing at the tables it seemed like it was hard to get a drink  location is great  you can walk everywhere 
fantastic pizza     charlotte   embrace the place or its not going to make it   perfect crust  great sauce 
pleasantly surprised based on other reviews  it helps that it is a gorgeous 77 degrees and were sitting outside  wife loves the cream ale  and the stout is quite good  lunch was excellent  the reuben sandwich was delicious  instead of the usual 3 4 slices of processed corned beef  they have 1 inch thick chunks of juicy deliciousness  the special hamburger  croque madam steak hache burger with prosciutto and an over easy egg was the best burger ive had in a long time  thick  juicy and cooked medium  not medium well  wish i had taken a picture before i destroyed it  daughter loved the buttered noodles  and the puteen app was delicious  looking forward to coming back and sitting in the roof 
not just a liquor store  this place is so much more  i asked for a particular beer  lagunitas born yesterday   and the owner walked me right over to the spot and told me all about it as well  this is a real mom and pop shop that has all the charms of a family run business  the owner is no awesome and she has so much more knowledge than the salesman at total wine  really grateful to have met her and her family 
sweet republics ice cream is made with love and heart  every ice cream i have tried here has been amazing  the staff is very nice and helpful and i love that you can try any ice cream until you find which one is going to be perfect for you that day  they make this ice cream homemade and it is unlike any place ice cream place  they have amazing flavors  my favorite is the milk and cookies 
thai e san is truly delicious  they create a very welcoming environment  its very clean and the staff is very friendly  the food is so good  my personal favorite item to get is the chicken pad thai spice level 3  they have a spice system 1 5 5 being the hottest which i am sure is very hot because theee leaves your mouth very warm 
this is a place to fall in love with modern spanish tapas   it its your first time  ask the waiter to suggest some of the signature dishes   the veal cheeks   i know  doesnt sound exactly good  are amazing   paella also   pricey  but worth it 
my cousin got married this past weekend and i was looking forward to the event   i have heard great things about this place     ceremony   basically couldnt see anything thanks to the planters that block our view   it was hard to feel like a part of the vows because it was impossible to see    and i was in the 2nd row on the grooms side    my favorite part was the extremely mean red haired photographer that informed us to not take any pictures during the ceremony  as they would be available for purchase online     while my cousin was walking down the aisle  he was the groom   the dj played  butterfly kisses  which was an obvious mistake   that was supposed to be the song played for the bride and her father   it was especially obvious when the song was restarted when the bride walked down the aisle     reception   wedding was at 7 30   we were not served food until 10pm   besides the extremely little hand passed appetizers that were fried  this was unacceptable   in the meantime  there was a photo booth set up and the family was taking pictures   once again  we asked the photographer about family pictures and he snapped at our family letting us know that we would have to make it  snappy   his exact words  because it was not included on the regular picture list   considering our family traveled across the country  this guy was way out of line   once the reception finally got underway   10pm  the food was mediocre    i walked away to go to the restroom and my full plate of food was removed   dj was boring as all get up and the music wasnt enticing enough to get out and dance   once everyone finally did dance  he would play a slow song   blek     anyway  overall  as an attendee  i would say that this was one of the most boring weddings ive been to   there was no coordinator to help move things along  dj was boring and the food wasnt great 
got my luggage off of the carousel to find the wheel was broken and that the airline wouldnt do anything about it so i went to these guys and had it replaced   i actually asked them to go ahead and switch out the second wheel since that was starting to look suspicious and add a standup post thats been missing for a while  as well  i asked for these extras    no one tried to upsell me  which was a relief   the price was amazing and i could have had it repaired the same day had i been in a hurry   he even gave me a  loan  suitcase since all of my stuff was in the one that needed to be repaired    how great is that   very impressed with these guys 
awesome restaurant  everyone was speaking italian  as an american in germany it was a fun experience  food was amazing  and the house red was a superb wine    the gelato was unique  and the tiramasu was great  outdoor patio on a warm evening  awesome  ill stop here again if im in stuttgart 
great food  red vine pizza was delicious  ingredients all seemed very fresh and the staff was very friendly 
i first called ultimate lawn maintenance when i needed my much overgrown back yard gutted  they werent able to do the job  but recommended affordable tree services  who not only were affordable  but professional and quick with their work   i have since called upon ultimate for regular maintenance on my front yard with trimming of trees  shrubs and weeds  just a simple text of the service im requesting and pics to brian and he answers right away with an estimate  also his team is out the very next day  on two different occasions  i had leakage from under my drive way and other sprinkler leaks  again the team was to my house the next day and all repairs done by the time i came home from work with very reasonable price   would defiantly recommend this company to anyone needing a one time fix or routine maintenance
we screamed in there at 10pm thinking they would just send us off but adam was so rad and didnt seem to mind one bit  even though im sure he did  we are now happily on our way with our sugar cookies  thanks adam    
went with new friends on our first eat out  date  oh my gosh   the menu  where to begin   i want to try one of everything   i had the fried green tomatoes  and chicken salad   exotic blend of down home cooking mixed with really good ideas  presentation beautiful   drinks  incredible  watermelon spritzer was awesome    portions are huge  these are shareable  plan to take home  ive seldom said id like to eat my way thru a menu   but here it goes   id like to eat my way thru the entire menu 
more like 1 5 stars but im rounding up since my lunch companion liked it and mentioned wanting to return   i think it might be better for takeout since one wouldnt have to deal with the awkward  silent mood set by the older couple who i assume are the owners   we ordered the  7 00 dine in bento special   note there are absolutely no substitutions on the bento even for a same price item  they wont swap the california roll with a cucumber roll    youd think theyd be more accommodating when business is so slow  and not be so focused on using their pre made  and not chilled  california rolls   the place was absolutely dead at peak lunch rush time   no one else came in the entire time   it was rather sad   the egg drop soup was very thick  viscous and plain   it requires me to use the provided soy sauce and pepper   the pepper shaker was empty and the gentleman  male owner   had to replace it   he was stoic  and awkwardly didnt speak or smile   the music was truly awful   the silver and black interior is not too bad  theyre trying   but its rather basic   the chicken katsu was low quality dark meat but moist  with a good crispy crunch of breading on the outside   it didnt get soggy throughout the meal   the side of rice was a little small  and slightly dry  i prefer sticky rice    the deep fried items on the side were fine  and the sushi was edible but around grocery store level quality   the woman working  female owner   wordlessly filled water glasses when needed but did smile until the very end of our meal   she also barely spoke   the man and woman sat at a booth on the restaurant floor with a computer while we ate  and the gentleman was making coughing and similar  sick  noises  which was off putting   he wasnt cooking  the woman vanished into the back so i assume she was the cook   maybe he rolls the sushi or something    thankfully   i wouldnt come back on my own volition  but the food was edible enough that i would do take out or tag along if i was in the area and someone else wanted to pay 
had an amazing experience at mimi and coco  from the octopus and potato appetizer to the incredible barramundi and side dishes everything exceeded our expectations  probably the best restaurant in lake las vegas  service and lake view are unbelievable   congratulations to allessandro  the owner  who hit it out of the park at this fabulous lake las vegas new restaurant  cant wait to go back   
this store sells expired products    please be careful     i have gotten sick on expired dairy products twice   after contacting the store  nobody was able to help me as they did not speak english  and i was told the manager was not around to give me a refund 
horrible  serves bad and slow  food cold  tasteless and soggy  saw the show and came to see 4 stars  forget it 
this place is awesome  i love the concept of it being just like a dry bar  blowouts  but for nails  staff is awesome  super clean  trendy  did a great job on my nails  easy to make an appointment but also easy for walk ins  definitely coming back and recommending to friends 
the perfect place for a date  every plate was delicious  and the service was fantastic  our server recommended excellent cocktails form their extensive list  and the tuna tartar and beet salad were amazing    i would say that the shareable plates are a bit small for the price  but the sophisticated and cozy atmosphere makes up for this  will definitely be back 
this place is spectacular   everything from the service to the food is top of the line   they present a wonderful multiple course american chinese menu that satisfies many taste buds   the complimentary tea with entrees could not be more of a plus  my family has eaten at this restaurant for years next to the the music lesson store and it has always been a special place for us  the owner treats us like family when we see her and the environment is always comforting   i drive over forty five minutes to eat at golden gate still because it is worth it  best crab angels 
we love italy and good italian food   this place feels like italy and the food is great  the moscato grappa was a perfect end to our meal  smooth  sweet and the flavor if italy 
yall are fantastic  i always make sure to tell people about you when anyone comes to town  even told my boss to take his lady jere for date night with 100  confidence they would enjoy themselves  a few years ago on my birthday we had a party of 8 for dinner  it started pouring rain outside where we were at and the staff had everyone on the patio come inside  there wasnt enough open tables so they let us all sit on the floor around one of the tables by a couch in the waiting area to enjoy our food and continue my birthday  it was a birthday i will never forget and how they went out of their way to not let the rain ruin dinner was something ill always be grateful for on top of every experience ive had eating here 
they get one star for friendly service and the cold beer  as for the food    my burrito wasnt fresh and the grits were a big let down  soupy  too much cream and no texture  obviously old  the shop itself is cool with a good atmosphere 
jen is amazing   i have had my share of less than satisfactory stylists and when i moved to az i was thrilled to have found jen   i simply cant say enough about how talented she is when it comes to hair   i recently moved back to chicago and havent even come close to finding a replacement   pretty sure i never will and might need to move back to az for this reason alone   go see jen you will not regret it    
i really like cajun queen  i have been several times now  and the food has always been great   the decor is unique and interesting and really helps in conveying a whimsical mood   portion sizes are generous and it is hard not to fill up on the main dishes  dessert  especially the bread pudding is worth saving room for   the service has always been friendly  although it can be a little slow at time  this is not a place for a quick bite to eat and more of a restaurant for a leisurely 2 3 hour dinner   noise levels can get a little high depending on where you are seated    overall highly recommended 
lovely foie gras and sea bass  perfectly prepared and a wonderful evening for my in laws 47th anniversary 
great service  nice decor  amazing chicken spring rolls and very reasonable pricing  
the food is good  im obsessed with their pot stickers  however the customer service is terrible  weve never had our meal there for that reason  when we come in to pick up the girl is always sitting there with friends and the first thing out of her mouth is  sigh  will you be eating here  sigh  and her friends just walk through the kitchen as they please  that cant be sanitary  weve been so displeased with the service we arent going back 
i went here because i wanted to try a new salon and im glad i did  there was no wait time and the staff was very warm and friendly  i had a pedi and a full set  both look beautiful  it was  25 for a full set with gel and  21 for the pedi  i highly recommend central nail 
i bought a groupon and was able to make an appointment quicker than i expected   the technicians were great    friendly and professional   the cleaning was beyond my expectations   i had considered replacing some of the carpet  now i think theres some life left   i will use them again for sure 
my teenage daughter told me about this place so i decided to give it a try   wow   these lovely ladies did  a great job   i have never been one to go get a pedicure regularly until started going here   now i go every three weeks 
walgreens  has slowly changed over the years and about a year and a half ago i switched to cvs at 60 n valle verde    i just got tired of being abused by pharmacists and store policies that make if difficult for older people to understand why  i would have to wait weeks or my  medication  after being stalled for days on end  and what is actually on sale on the floor and what is not   since i switched i have never had any problems with my meds  at walgreens there are a lot of fine print signs leading one to believe items are on sale when they are not   they are mixed together making the customer think the line of the product is on sale when in actuality only one color is on sale  today it was lipstick and sorry to say i broke my own do not use walgreen rule  at cvs i have never had a problem understanding what is a on sale and what is not  i am sorry i broke my rule of not using walgreens today  it only led to frustration 
veggiehouse   i love this place  ive been coming here for the past 2 yrs  amd the customer service is amazing  all of the waitresses are sweet as can be and although theres a bit of a language gap theyre amazing    theyre knowledgable of the menu and always suggest new things to try that never dissapoint  this place is amazingggg and defntly one of my fav vegan places in vegas  good job guys keep up the great work 
this place is the best  the ambience is cozy and nice  we went there several times and all foods that we tried were perfect  now i am a big fan of indian foods i  suggest butter chicken  beef khorma and le taj platter  beside the pea rice with saffron and nan were awesome  the indian tea is also special for us  the service is very good  and people are very friendly  i definitely suggest this place 
we had pirogis as an appetizer and they were greasy and unappetizing    i had noticed that salads at other restaurants i had tried looked wilted and disgusting and so i had been avoiding ordering them even though id been dying for some veggies  so i asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at church brew  the waitress assured me that their salads were fresh and top quality  she seemed very offended that i would even ask about the quality of the salads    what she brought me though was a wilted mess slathered in dressing  some of the leaves were downright bad and had gone brown and squishy    the quinoa was unbelievable  it tasted like old refrigerator 
beautiful concept of arts and food    i havent seen a restaurant like that  it was a first  we had a sampling of food presented by the head chef himself  every sample was made to savour in your mouth   overall  the pictures speak a thousand words   i love the food and the atmosphere of the place  without forgetting our main waiter who was fantastic  i will come back once again to sample the rest of the menu 
wonderful service  the staffs make sure you are well taken care of  the food is great with good portions and good price  one complaint i have is the fruits bowls     4  for a small bowl is a bit too much for me  overall  there are options that are less expensive for more than a fruit bowl worth  i give it a 4  for the awesome service  the food and the atmosphere  i took out one star because the price can be a bit too crazy for the portion of the food 
delux is a restaurant i expected to be better than it actually was  the restaurant was not bad  but it also didnt strike me as particularly good  i really have nothing else to say about it 
how have i not written about this place yet  this is the best thai restaurant in the city  as far as i can tell  the food is phenomenal  the restaurant is gorgeous  and the wait staff are friendly and helpful  they make pad thai that doesnt taste like ketchup  this really shouldnt be something that sets a thai restaurant apart from the rest  but in toronto it seems to be   seriously  toronto thai places  you need to stop with that already   you can get a pumpkin soup that is served in a pumpkin  fish that is all kinds of awesome  i love this place  and would go all th time if it wasnt out in the middle of nowhere 
this spot is absolutely perfect  multiple seating options  comfy sofa  tables  stools at a bar counter in the window  some great drinks  including a peanut butter blended something that provides both protein and caffeine  kind staff  good coffee  beautiful art and jewelry  even though i would love one or two more food options  i look forward to hanging there twice a week before class  i feel good about supporting the business  and the location is ideal whether by car  foot  or the light rail for running other errands 
wow  truely outstanding    this place is great   it has great customer service and great food    we ordered take out from them on several occasions and the customer service and personnel are very pleasant and go out of their way to help you   we ordered 7 pizzas the first time we tried them and everything was excellent   we then ordered 15 pizzas and again  everything was great   the pizzas were all excellent again   we are very pleased with everything and we will continue to use their restaurant   highly recommended 
i ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and they were great   very spicy  which i liked   not a huge fan of the  10 minimum for credit cards 
i had the beef curry upton while visiting downtown cleveland  the curry was on par with the flavor and the beef was cooked well with out being dry  it also had corn  onions and broccoli in it  it was very good  my only suggestion is i wish  the menus werent hanging on the wall right by the register so you have a little more time to review it before the pressure of ordering  there was a long line so it would have given everyone plenty of time to review the options 
if i could give a rating of zero  i would  lack of management and a blatant disregard for professionalism has created a chasm of abysmal service accompanied by a consistent state of denial that something is fundamentally wrong  do not eat here 
incredibly nice staff in an awesone ramen bar that is uber cool  3 projectors play japanese anime behind the bar with the staff curating a great selection of music   fantastic ramen with great  small plates of tasty yakitori also on the menu  decent selection of sake  plus craft beer  wine   full bar with signature cocktails also on the menu   a great  cool place thats been needed on the westside for quite some time 
we were in a hurry  luckily we visited on sunday   15 for your brunch and they have    chocolate waffel  yes   its as delicious as you think it is  if only i wasnt full from the rest of buffet  i e  beef roast  home made mozzarella  swedish meetballs  pasta salad  home made scone    yea therere more   i would order another one  anyway    next time ill come starving and make sure its a four hour brunch 
i ordered the nachos with steak and it was delish  it was a large portion  plenty to share or for an appetizer  the service was great and price was reasonable 
we live in california and had to go to scottsdale for an important oncology appointment  our  scaredy  dog pepper goes with us everywhere but we couldnt take her into the doctors office or leave her in the car  its a bit hot in arizona   we found hillside unleashed on the internet and our intuition said  this place smells right   we were not disappointed  when we picked up pepper  we also got a report card for her with all as and a   we praised pepper for getting as and a  and she said that she is giving all the caretakers at hillside unleashed an a  as well  in fact  she said she got more attention at hillside unleashed in 4 hours than she gets from us during the whole day  ouch   she liked it so much  she wants to come back  now we have to plan another trip to az for any reason  just so that she can stay   i mean play with the wonderful employees at hillside unleashed again  usually  she is shaking when we pick her up from boarding  the vet  or the groomer  she wasnt shaking at all   except her tail  hillside unleashed in scottsdale is fantastic    
everyone from air supply is excellent   ben yarkoni came over when my air condition was out in the middle of the heat wave    he came in saved the day  he was honest to me from the very beginning  which i very much appreciated   he explained everything to me and told me what would be best by telling me the compressor fan was shot as well as the transporter   he pointed things out and helped my understand my situation  ben and all the techs were very kind  professional and thorough with the job  robert was also very good and takes his job seriously  from start to finish this company has proved to me that they are the best  and their pricing is very reasonable  the owners issac and david are very good  isaac would take the time to speak to you over the phone over any issues you may have personally  which many company owners wouldnt care to do  they stand by their products and labor  very good at what they do  dont go through any other company  believe me  i write reviews on here   but not often   unless the service was either super good or very bad  trust my judgment when i say  air supply is the absolute best 
great service   and nice owners   i take my maltipoo every month and half  he always does a great job  this is my go to grooming salon   thank you guys 
first time at this restaurant the service was top notch the food was amazing love the ambience great location  i had the seared salmon with baby green salad and everything was cooked perfection  also tried a chefs board and that was very well prepared and delicious 
food was delicious   had a little something for everyone   desserts were the best   love loved the banana bread pudding     only negative was service   we had two rounds at the buffet before we even saw a waitress to get a drink   ordered just soft drinks and water  so we were pretty low maintenance   she was very nice  but seemed a little overwhelmed   we did ask the hostess three times and then a manager before someone decided we were worth helping   very disappointing as we are platinum total rewards members 
very well kept and entertaining airport     i have flown here before as a connecting airport and have never had any problems    and to top it all off the bars have an excellent beer selection    i will try and make my connecting flights here more often   
this is not a fancy restaurant  i repeat  it is not a fancy restaurant    what it is    it is a casual restaurant where you order your comfort food or whatever you feel like having  they have it  they will serve it to you quickly   there is no 5 stars treatment  you come in  eat and go    i wanted some congee at 10 pm at night  since the closing time was near  they ran out of the usual dim sum food  the waiter suggested i i ordered some fried rice or noodle soup  i couldnt resist so i did  i ordered the large bbq duck with wonton noodle soup   it was delicious and satisfying     overall  i think the service was pretty good  it has the nice casual outgoing vibe i was looking was and the price is pretty good    if you all want to have a fancy time  you can go to maxim oriental or the crystal restaurant  this place has its purpose 
i heard about this place a few years ago and i always hear great reviews about the food  here is the truth  it is not real japanese cuisine but a fusion of japanese and peruvian   the reason they explained to my boyfriend and i is each region of the city has a perferance    we ordered the 62  for two persons dishes which consist of sushis  salads and raw fishes  i notice they put a lot of vinegar in some of the dishes  overall  our menu consist of a little bit of everything on the menu and it tastes great  i had a lovely experience and my boyfriend who is even more picky than i love the experience  the decorations compliment our dishes as well    i love how the waiters jokes and talked to you     especially the vietnamese one  sorry  i didnt catch your name   i want to say thanks for making the evening extra special for my boyfriend and i   i will go back again 
was really looking forward to coming here but foh and manager were incredibly rude and not accommodating  did not end up staying and eating even though we had made a reservation several weeks in advance  im sure the food is good but the service  terrible 
saw this place on check please arizona and finally had a chance to come in on my birthday  great place for a new experience  you will need to save room and maybe skip lunch haha we had the meal for two  the bread has an interesting texture but went well with the food  although they you give you forks its best eaten by hand and will leave a dry flourish feeling to your fingers  to help with this they do prove hand wipes  my hub wasnt too big on the bread but i loved it  i went to town on the meal  the yekemim shai is their spiced iced or hot tea and was very flavorful  will definitely return 
eh  ordered their pancakes and they were a snooze  maybe its just their pancakes or the morning we went  ordered the pancake flight with pineapple upside down  menu says it has a house made creme anglaise  expecting the yummy custard sauce  instead received cream in the pancake  kind of odd   sweet potato mine was good  hub ordered these by themselves and they seemed overdone and the caramel was overcooked   and strawberry shortcake okay   service was okay  they were busy  if we decide to try them again  itll be different menu items 
i came in today with a steering wheel shimmy  tire wobble  and clunking noise  i planned on just replacing the 1 sides outer tie rod and do an alignment had a coupon   assuming that was all it was due to similar symptoms years ago when the previous part was failing  i was presented with a  1700 estimate    was told the clunking  could be  either the struts  tie rods inner   outer  and a tire they claim was separating   it seems they dont find the issue  just throw parts at it  i said nope thanks  pack it up  im leaving  went to the shop i normally go to and had them look over what this place claims i needed  only the tire was needing replacement  under warranty  due to a bubble not separation  shimmy and clunking noise is gone   while the parts this place said was the cause of the issue are wearing out  but still functioning as intended  this place has horrible reviews and i see why  also overheard greg talking about an older couples appearance while they were walking in for an oil change  highly unprofessional  one star for wes because he tried to help  but no thanks i will not be back nor refer anyone to this location 
mobile mechanics came to my work and fixed my car outside in the parking lot during my work day  it was very convenient and my car was fixed and ready to drive home at the end of the day  they did not rip me off and gave me warranties for the parts that can be used nationally  one of which is a lifetime warranty   they were easy to work with and very responsive  thank you mobile mechanics 
highly recommend  staff is great and warm  especially sean  norris and mark they all very nice and helpful  room is clean and quiet  very comfortable in the room  summer is cooler than outside  winter is warmer than outside  dont need to run coolest air condition or high heat  wore summer clothes when winter time dont even need to run heater  they do back ground checks  so feel safe to live here  they have no problem to return  100 deposit back to you when check out  descent size for studio and one bedrooms  cleaning crews keep the resident environment very clean  its good experience to live here  definitely will go back again   
stay as far away from these guys as possible  never showed for auto glass appointment  would not return calls  when i did talk with their dispatcher i know it was after lunch but he didnt have to belch over the phone  im amazed theyre in business 
i had my 40th birthday party here after going there a couple times   it was fantastic   they handled 36 people on a saturday night  and were tripping over themselves to serve us   food was delicious and my friends  all foodies couldnt get over how there was never an empty margarita glass the whole night   diana  the manager  simply rocks   
love it  love it  love it   havent taken anyone there who didnt say the same   food is great  infused martinis fabulous and the wine list extensive   go 
what can i say about this place  the hotel section actually has no smoking signs  the general demographic seems to be people from all over the world  i got a free upgrade to a better room at the same rate  i had a ton of fun at the adventuredome theme park which has places to smoke just outside a thin glass door  i saved by using their mcdonalds open for breakfast dinner  i dont know what kind of lifestyle you lead  but i was much more comfortable in this atmosphere than if i was at the much more ritzy paris hotel   casino  i never felt like my kids were in danger  and i always wanted to be anywhere but my awesome hotel room so i could be doing any of the number of things to do at this place  i literally just came from disneyland the day before  and had much more fun between gambling  shopping  rides  and booze  this will always be my 1st choice for vegas  5 stars    note  the dart game gives a prize to 12 and under no matter what 
this is a top notch salon  or rather a chain of them  that has a very efficient system for booking and gifting  which i like very much  i used them for both via their website and was pleased  their pedicures are top notch and i was impressed  i only knock a star off because it was still overpriced  but for the overall experience it was worth it 
average spanish tapas for average prices with friendly staff  i would not recommend the sangria or rice pudding if you are seeking something traditional  but if you just want to get an idea of what spanish food is    go for it  its definitely not bad  i just am picky and prefer authentic 
most items  1      visited this place on my lunch hour today  very friendly service  do agree with one of the reviews below that states to check all your merchandise before you pay   all sales are final and there are no exchanges  almost all items are  1  but keep in mind you get what you pay for  do not come in expecting jewelry that will last you a lifetime  but if youre looking for earrings or accessories that wont leave you a sobbing mess if they ever get lost  i lose earrings all the time  then this is your place  i do wish they would have a board up with all the specials going on  the lady working rattled them all off and there was no way i was going to remember all that  
ate here last week while on lunch  other than the long line  is there really anything to say   its in n out people  its delicious  cant go wrong         
came here on a friday night  ate at the bar  service was awesome and our server was extremely cool to let us split our bills without rolling her eyes  she was great  the food  however  was a little on the bland side  ordered the fish and chips and a chicken quesadilla appetizer  both were on the bland side and needed a little more salt  i will say this  the fish and chips portion was huge and enough for two to share  the chicken quesadilla was only  5 as part of the happy hour specials  and the atmosphere was pretty cool  i will definitely return and give it another shot  if not for the food  definitely for the drinks and atmosphere 
sorry bjs  our last visit has made me decide that we can no longer be friends  although you do normally serve delicious food  our last visit here during the early evening hours left us wanting more  our server ignored us for our entire meal  we had to get her attention for more napkins and water  even after she said shed be back with more water   and she seemed entirely pre occupied  we had our 2 year old with us and that  unfortunately  sometimes seems to scare our servers off  our child was very well behaved and we always clean up after ourselves  although you are normally an awesome place for happy hour or a dinner for two  please do not ignore your paying customers  and good tippers i might add  just because they have a little one 
bring cash  arrive early  bring a fully charged phone  love the small town feel of downtown henderson  love the barbers here  if you have a favorite make sure you keep tabs of when theyre working  
thank you petiquette for being patient with our maine coon and sending him home with a fresh lion cut  being the parent of a bossy  attitude y  entitled cat  rare  but yes  they do exist      i am sometimes nervous that new groomers will not give my guy a chance  but you assured me you would and you did  for that i thank you and i promise to tell all my friends about you  
delicious food and wonderful service  enjoyed the greek crepe as well as the berry one  awesome how their menu is not limited to sweet crepes  the mimosa sampler was delicious  enjoyed being able to sample their top 3  peach  blood orange  and guava   loved the peach one     service was wonderful and they offer outdoor seating which is awesome as long as the weather is right  will definitely be returning to crepe expectations   
great hotel spot to stay in  super clean and super nice rooms  free wifi in the rooms  beds were really comfortable  they have a parking lot which was cheap  gym was very spacious and had all the essentials for a decent workout  front desk people were really helpful 
love this place      my jaw did drop to the floor when i saw the ridiculous line  but the wait was worth it     tables were supposedly all booked and the hosts wanted to get tipped on top of the  50 covercharge for guys and  20 for girls  the inside of the club is sooo beautiful  almost slipped on the dancefloor a few times though        the best part is the pool   i got to soak my feet when they were about to fall off    and the breathtaking view you get of your surroundings   definately a must visit spot in vegas  
students beware      i lived in las vegas for two years attending school and got a membership at this gym  at the time i signed up i was told that when i was ready to come home i just had to let them know  pay a  50 cancellation fee and itd be fine   well    i called and get the total run around  i was told that i need to provide a lease agreement  uh  im moving home to live with my parents  theres no lease   i can send a utility bill with my name on it  what part of i am moving home to live with my parents is it that you dont understand   i can give a  newly issued  drivers license  uh  i maintained my ca state residency so my license is from ca   they wont issue me a new one so that my membership at the gym can be canceled     when you try to cancel youll run around in circles with these people   email and they claim they dont get it  call and they give you a list of documents that are impossible  as a student  to produce  meanwhile they debit your account month after month   so  my recommendation to you is this   if you are a student in las vegas avoid this club like the plague  you may get a good workout or two in but the price when you move back home or get transferred isnt worth it  worst customer service     ever 
although the line was extremely long  i expect this during the holiday  the checkout girl named anne was so cheerful and lovely i forgot how mad i was for waiting in line  i dont see her there regularly so i think she may be a seasonal employee  if thats the case she should be hired on full time  i absolutely loved her energy and will come back to see her 
when you place a phone order  pay  tip  and wait for your order because its not finished    then the girl at the register takes more orders in a row  and the people that came in after you  4 of them  yes i counted  get their food    never again   
so im currently here    3 45  4 they cut off lunch prices    theres 14 chairs  only 4 are sitting yet we cant sit for lunch    theres 7 chefs    never had a problem here until this hostess was here    ive never seen this hostess    if i see her again  i will not come back   thank u for pushing us for dinner prices before we could sit for lunch    thank you also for sitting us next an annoying loud young couple    also i had to remind the waitress of our orders    will most definitely not be back    youre better off at sushimon   
food is passable nothing special  however  the service left a lot to be desired  been there a couple of times but one incident stands out  the host refused to seat our group of 3  although a larger table was available  and also refused to provide us with any time frame within which a table could be arranged  will not go there again  or recommend the place  there are better places serving indian food in toronto and any service is better than copper chimney
quite different from what youd expect from a regular sushi bar or japanese restaurant   upon walking in  all the staff will heartily shout out greetings  and goodbyes when you leave   the food is great  with the menu containing both more traditional and innovative offerings    food  individual portions are small and cheap  the point being so that you can order a multitude of things to sample  they had sweet shrimp sashimi as a special that day  the shrimps were served with the heads still on which i had never experienced before  but was very fresh  id recommend the karaage  fried chicken  and black cod  both were very good  we also tried the fried brie cheese among others  which was interesting  crunchy on the outside  warm and gooey on the inside  served with a sweet mango dressing   service  servers here are enthusiastic and friendly and food comes out pretty fast and at a consistent pace  theyre attentive as well  coming by periodically to refill drinks   setting  very cool vibe overall   tables are mostly communal benches  although there are also smaller  more private tables available  came here with a friend early and managed to get our own table  although it was very cramped  with the table being almost the same width as the stool  the place is loud  but the high ceilings and bright interior give the place an airy and cheerful atmosphere   no reservations here  show up early or be prepared to wait in line for a long time  although their food is certainly very good  the dishes are quite small and it definitely starts adding up fast  especially if you want to walk away full  my friend and i ended up paying   50 each  including 1 drink each  
the best place i have ever been to ever   i was walking by  then i saw a boxing area which i thought  how random and cool      then when i peaked inside and saw some random t shirts  old sodas  a classic food truck  old movies playing    and all put together in a great way   i tried their jack daniels pecan pie  with a cup of coffee    the best thing that i have ever had    its a to die for 
thank you jason at rohrich honda   i arrived an hour early for my appointment      and i was still taken quickly and  courteously   jason went above and beyond to make sure i was happy when i left   the price was fair and the team was very professional   i will be back for service to my crz 
i only got to stop by cleveland for about half a day while i was visiting a college and i knew that  unless i went to this college  i just may never be back  therefore  i had to see the rock and roll hall of fame  my family holds a bit of bitterness towards it  as it was almost in philadelphia  where were from  but were excited to check it out nonetheless   first off  we spent about 10 minutes just listening to the songs on those little listening stations  i enjoyed everything from funkadelic  to beck  to grandmaster flash  reading up on the songs while doing so  after that  we preceded to tour the actual exhibits  as a first time visitor i found this really  really cool  my favorite things were the costumes  especially the really extravagant ones like those of bootsy collins  david bowie  and george clinton  i also loved the rap section and appreciated it being there  slick ricks eyepatch  flavor flavs clock chain  ll kool js kangol hat  other favorites of mine were jimi hendrixs drawings  and the original polaroid collage that became the cover art for talking heads  more songs about buildings and food   one of my favorite albums   i didnt get to spend much time there  maybe 3 hours  but i imagine i could have stayed all day  even so  it was annoying that i couldnt take pictures  every other thing i saw i wanted to snap a photo to show my friends   look  i was 6  away from princes guitar  i dont care if you know the release date of every album of his  that makes me a bigger fan 
im so impressed with these movers  they are really made this move easy and  surprisingly enough  fun  we had to move a big storage unit to two different locations and they tackled it with a great attitude and we cant thank them enough for making this easy  weve been stressing about doing this for years and had we known they were going to be this great we would have done it sooner   thanks guys 
i stayed at the flamingo a few months ago and loved it  the room was clean and smelled great  the pool is a party pool  drinks are flowing and everyone was dancing  i got a great deal on my room via a club promoter  the site was vegasbooked com  i recommend using it to save some money so you extra to spend at the craps table 
i love this place   usually only stop in for small bites  though whenever i get a full plate entree  my body and belly feels enchanted  the staff is kind and welcoming with pleasant vibes  thank you for being in our neighborhood  and being a restaurant practicing delicious forms of culinary arts 
hung out at fuku on saturday and sunday talked with colin hes cool guy    best burger hands down   never mad it to fatburger   and dont care    fuku burger  with those amazing fries   loved it   from ur tx buds    
this is a must stop whenever im in vegas   4 words  adobo fried rice omelette    sure i can easily make this at home  but something about the dish that just isnt the same if i was to make it at home  its actually good here    everything else is pretty good too  ive had their tapsilog  saimin  longsilog  all good but again 4 words  adobo fried rice omelette  geeeeet it 
dont go here period  my wife went here last week for a mystic tan  you go into the room  leave you clothes and jewelry on the chair  and go in the booth  her wedding ring fell on the floor when she was getting dressed after the tan   she was busy and realized that it had fallen on the floor so called them immediately while we were running errands afterwards   they put her on hold for ever even after knowing how scared and heartbroken she felt about it being on the floor of the room   we drove there and the manager that was there when my wife was there  the only person working there at the time  had already left   she had cleaned the room and other clients may have been in the room   told the girl at the counter that we wanted to speak to the manager right away and of course she never answered her phone or called the location back  look  we are intelligent people and realize that we may never see the ring again   however  the way a business deals with a situation is the key   simply be responsive  show you care about your customers  take something like this seriously  and so forth   they did none of the above   the manager never called us back even though i told the girl at the counter that i would speak to my attorney   as a rule  if you tell 10 people that you hated the service at a business they will in turn tell 5 or 10 people   ultimately  one bad experience can cost a business 50   100 lost customers   i have about 1 000 contacts in my address book   friends  family  colleagues  clients  and the like   guess what jamaica me tan you probably just lost 5   10 thousand potential customers because your staff was unprofessional and couldnt show us the least bit of care   they could have offered to call the customers that had used that room  called management to respond to us  someone beyond the young girl manager   or anything   they didnt and i am talking to my attorney   whether they are liable for the ring or not isnt my concern anymore   the ring was expensive and more importantly has a sentimental attachment   they just frankly didnt care at all so its only fair to let people know what they are getting for their hard earned dollars   there are tons of tanning joints so go somewhere else 
i expected to be very impressed with this business  sadly i wasnt   i paid handsomely to have a k2 mountain bike packaged and shipped   they told me it would be done in 2 days  and they even told me it was shipped when it wasnt   thats a lie in my book    i only learned there was a problem when it was mia 9 days later   and get this  when i called to ask where my bike was they were disorganized and sounded uninterested in helping me   so sad too   i had already picked out the replacement bike which im going to buy  and i will  but i will not buy it here    3k is a lot to spend with a business that shows so little regard for its customers    be warned 
ive been going to see susana here for almost 2 years   shes fantastic   i was recommended to her from a friend when i moved to town and am so glad i found her   everywhere else ive lived i moved stylist to stylist because i cant find one i liked well enough to stick with   im not someone who does anything crazy with my hair   just long layers and highlights  lowlights and most places ive gone the stylist makes me feel boring or pressures me to try something different   not susana   she knows just what i want and i look   feel awesome every time i leave   plus  i wanted to grow my hair out for years  but its really thick and no one has been able to get it to lay nicely as it grows out   i usually look like a xmas tree   susana got it the first time and now my hair is as long as ive ever had it thanks to susana    i love the cappuccino during the service   nice perk   prices are very reasonable i think  i think i paid  185 for cut and partial highlights   definitely recommend this place and especially susana 
this place was really cool   it has a mechanical bull and great decor  with a southwest sugar skull day of the dead type theme   we had initially gone just to have a few drinks but decided to order dinner while we there as well   we had actually stumbled upon it trying to see if the linq was up and running yet  but we are glad we found it   the food is tapas style and i definitely recommend the lobster tacos and the sopes   both were delicious   their drinks pretty good too   the waitresses and female bartenders have a whole lot of cleavage hanging out which is fine unless you have young kids  but really it wouldnt even hit the richter scale of things you dont want your kids to see if you have them on the las vegas strip anyways   call me conservative   very pretty girls though   if you are going up the stairs to use the bathroom  be sure to check out all the sombreros on the wall in the staircase   very cool   i loved the decor   i wished there was more people there and that the mechanical bull was going when we were there but i think we caught them seriously a few days after they opened     i will definitely be going back and taking friends there while they are in town 
there are no words for this exhibit    you definitely have to go see for yourself   i actually would love to go back and spend some more time there   it truly is amazing  not just the human body itself but the time and skill put into creating these exhibits   it is initially kind of eerie because they are real bodies  but once you get past that  which you will after you are overcome with awe by about the second body   it was very educational  a great thing to take kids to despite the nature of it 
this place was actually a lot cooler than i thought it was going to be   when i went they were also showcasing an area 51 exhibit which i also saw   this museum i think is owned by the smithsonian  so you got the story that the government wants you to hear   i personally laughed at a few of their shenanigans   it was worth seeing though   the atomic museum was really cool and very educational   they had a lot of cool displays and a video feature which was cool   it is a walk through type of thing  unguided at your own pace   at the end they had a giant beam from the world trade center  which i felt was unrelated  but it still has a somber feel to it 
this museum is a really cool place to check out     there is so much to learn here about the chicago mob and its influence on las vegas   it has a comprehensive history on the mob and the police efforts to squash them   it shows information about all of their illegal activities and has this cool room with stacks of money to show you how much they skimmed from the books and hid from the government   it is three stories and you walk through it at your own pace   i made the mistake of going right before lunch  not realizing that it takes some time to read through everything and see everything and had to stop for a snack at the gift shop   eat lunch beforehand and enjoy   the gift shop is one of the best that i have seen at these in town exhibits   i will also note that they recently donated a million dollars or something to the city of las vegas which makes me like them even more 
i liked this restaurant   good food   it wasnt too busy when we went there  but it was like noon   i thought the food was tasty  service was good   didnt have drinks but the ones on other peoples tables look nice 
pretty good poke   i like that you can order several different kinds in smaller containers as oppose to only getting one larger portion   its a little weird  there are three different restaurants all in one shared area   there is a sushi place and a hawaiian bbq place   its cool if you have people who dont want the same thing as you   very casual atmosphere where you order at the counter   many different kinds of poke to chose from   would go there again   i went to the other hawaiian place across from lvac in that shopping center  and poke express is much better in my opinion 
all suite hotel very   w  type parking lot right in front of lobby no casino
fantastic service and great food  owner is usually there and is always friendly and helpful  i would strongly recommend this place 
have been to this restaurant several times now   they have great food and as usual enjoyed   the service is friendly and staff are knowledgeable about the menu    highly recommended
very impressed   my wife and i decided to try it and were pleasantly surprised   greeted with a smile by the server   fast service   excellent food    definitely going to be coming back
great bar downtown   for sure  the power hour they offer is one of the best deals in cleveland   the staff is great  and the food is consistently good 
went in 15 minutes to closing with my 2 gfs but already knew what i wanted  started with a nice greeting from young lady putting shoes away who was also very helpful with finding what i needed  grabbed what i needed and proceeded to the cashier who didnt acknowledge me for at least 5 minutes even when there was nobody in front of me  meanwhile my gfs are talking to each other as they wait for me  salesperson  cashier finally rings up my shoes  upon paying for my shoes using the credit card machine i accidentally insert and slide my card on the top thinking it was like other machines ive used  he rudely states   its its the middle   points to it   i apologized and he doesnt reply  i then use the pen that comes with it to touch screen to finish my transaction but it doesnt take  he states   you gotta use your fingers  in a tone that stated i shouldve known that  i stated   sorry but you didnt tell me that   he ignores me and starts talking to other cashier putting down my 2 friends waiting for me stating   they cant be just yapping away over there when were about to close   i then stated   theyre with me   again no apologies  final part of transaction im assuming i need to use my finger to press buttons on screen but he then states rudely   for this you gotta use the pen  as if i should know that when he told me in the beginning that i was supposed to use my fingers  i was pretty upset by then  transaction finally gets done and noted no thank you and just hands me my bag  same nice young lady tell us thank you as we leave  i would just like to say that workers should not be rude regardless if store is about to close  we were there before 9 and got to the cashier before then  it looked like they were doing inventory after hours but that was no excuse to be rude with paying customers  sad part is i love skechers  as a nurse ive been using it for years  now wondering if i should venture out 
i have never been so appalled walking into a high end store   walking into burberry i expected to be greeted or at least acknowledged by one of the sales representatives  however  i did not get one hello or even a head nod  mind you there were plenty of workers just standing around  especially behind the register just chatting with one another    i continued to walk around the store and noticed that the employees that were actually on the floor were only helping out customers who were of asian decent  unfortunately i am not of asian decent    i finally chose a purse that i wanted to purchase and proceeded to wait in line  i was the only one in line at the time and two employees were checking out two customers  who of course  were asian  mind you there were still a few employees that were standing behind the register chatting and not even bothering to ring me up    once one employee finished up with their transaction  they looked at me and turned their back and decided to join the other employees in their conversation  then once the final employee finished up their transaction  they too turned around and joined in on the conversation   standing there dumbfounded with this item in my hand  wanting to purchase it  my blood was already boiling   thankfully  keith gonzales saw that i had been standing there for a while  a little irritated  and asked if anyone had helped me  he then rang me up and continuously apologized for the inconvenience    it seems to me that the only type of customer this burberry location bends backwards for is those customers who are of asian decent  i noticed anytime a family walked in  they were politely approached and greeted whereas the minute i walked in no one looked my way     being a manager at a retail store  i can tell when an employee truly cares about the customer versus an employee who only wants to make the commission  keith gonzales truly cares about the customer and i thank him for being the only employee to have made my experience less tragic  at least towards the end    a brand with this stature should not have employees who fail to present proper customer service  i expected a lot more from burberry 
wings were good  definitely not cheap  food took 25 minutes from the time of order to service and they forgot our veggies  we have been here for nearly an hour since we walked in and now are about to leave   there have been 3 other customers this entire time  ill never eat here again unless its takeout     good thing they serve beer  youre going to need it for the wait    wingstop replied    they have a standard cook time  apparently this is 25 minutes   i can grill a perfect chicken breast in my back yard in 15 minutes 
read the reviews before i went so i knew what i was getting into  its not a bargain thrift kind of place  its a shop where the money goes to hospice  so they need to make money  tons of staff  almost too many  found a few bargains  but most items were overpriced for my taste  probably would not return since im from out of state and there are too many other great shops to hit with my limited free time 
very small neighborhood bar  restaurant  very inexpensive  very affordable and non smoking  too  tonight only one bartender and one waiter  but considering those facts  service was fairly good  customer service was great  too  nick did an outstanding job as our waiter  definitely will be back 
outstanding work  honest  they go over and above to do a job and kelly and brock are terrific people besides    they replaced my back bumper   someone had backed into me in a shopping center   yuck    made it as good as new 
went back just to see if it was as good as it was the last time   it was   this place is worth a stop   we took friends and they loved it   the bruschetta and antipasta board are great   wines by the glass also very good   go  go  go 
been her several times and always found it to be good   this time it was even better   glad to see they are stepping up their game a bit   the 100  beers on tap are always good and the wines by the glass are good enough  not great but what you would expect    the sliders and fries are always good   my friend ordered a spinach dip of some kind  app   he liked it very much   suprised he didnt swallow the plate and a piece of the bar with it   it was busy  the bartenders were very attentive  and i will be back   happy hours here are good as well 
the food and service were very good   as is typical with vegas  when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another   why not but actually wed like to taste it   i had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon  very good    the make your own salad with up to ten items was great   everybody loved the food  the orin swift prisoner by the bottle was fabulous  red blend from napa   and the service was very good   we closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along   will go back 
tried this place because they sent me a free meal postcard for my bday and was pleasantly surprised  its within walking distance of the harkins chandler crossroads theatre and theyve only been open a couple months    i got the chicken tenders meal and upgraded to the fried mushrooms as my side  the chicken was pretty good  a little stringy at times  and the mushrooms were good as well  i opted for the gravy  ranch  and the slim sauce as my dipping sauces and liked the gravy the best  the slim sauce didnt really do anything for me    my son got the bbq wings and fries and he rated it an 8 out of 10  i tried one of his wings and thought it was just ok  nothing to write home about    both our meals also came with texas toast  which my son loved  and a medium drink  which was great that it was included  i think our meals were  8 29 and  8 49 before tax   they have coke products as well as lemonade and about 3 4 different iced tea options to quench your thirst    very friendly and helpful staff and our food came out pretty quickly   i would probably rate this a 3 5 if we had the option for half stars but rounded up due to the service  i dont eat fried chicken or wings very often but i would definitely come back here  the chicken salad looked pretty good too  its a good option before heading to the movies 
firstly  save room for a pastry   great sandwiches   bread is home made and is fantastic   it was busy when we got there but the line moved quickly   i had the speck and ill have it again   next time ill bring a few pastries for the road  chocolate croissant was fantastic   thanks to ddd for turning me on to this place 
i just came here for the first time and ate the following  vegetarian steamed bun  tasty but didnt rock my world   eggplant double down  incredible  never would have ordered this but my vegetarian friend did and wow im happy i ate it   and the empanada  not loving it  good dough but the beef didnt have the right balance of spice    fun atmosphere though  id be happy to go back  they were playing great music 
i was in town for business and happened to stumble upon maximum comics   i have yet to find a comic book shop that has the knowledge  selection and customer service of this place   i only get to vegas 6 7 times a year but always make time to stop by and load up on comics whenever i am in town   jay  the owner  always has great suggestions and even though im not a  regular  he remembers me and treats me like one   he has turned me on to some books that i never would have picked up and am now hooked since i read the first issue   thanks jay 
this is one of the better thai restaurants in arizona   their pa nang curry is addictive and i have to have it 3x a month   the restaurant is generally busy and the wait staff is a little slow  but they consistently make good food and are priced very reasonably 
my wife and i eat out 3 4 times a week   we have a hard time finding restaurants that consistently serve great food and have even better service   cyclo has both  and justina makes dining an absolute pleasure   we have been dining at cyclo for 3 years and it is definitely one of my top five restaurants in the phoenix metro area  cyclo does not serve alcohol but has a byob policy that makes going out to dinner a whole lot less expensive   i highly suggest eating here as it is one of the better restaurants that i have experienced 
tim and martell were great    friendly  fast  and professional   carpets look great   would definitely recommend heavens best   
i have had two sons go through psat prep with adam with exceptional results   both sons reached commended status for national merit narrowly missing semi finalist status   both were well prepared for the sat and act as well with no addtional prep needed beyond what they did with adam for the psat   if adam has a  secret  it might be that he knows how to help his students take down the stress level a notch during a time that can typically be very stressful   i have one more child to go through the college admissions process and she will absolutely be prepping with the test whisperer 
my girlfriend and i were in the mood to try something new and we were not disappointed  really good quality and not a lot of wait time  very good prices for what you get  would definitely go again
me and my cousins and my sisters had a mini family reunion there recently  the service and wait staff were excellent and always checking in on us if we needed anything and cheerful   the food and drinks was excellent and reesonably priced and proportioned 
been going to pho peter for over 10 years and its soup and fresh rolls are the best in town  the interior does need an update but dont judge it by that  the food is fresh  hot and favourable  its like a 2nd home away from home  you be the judge of it 
i went to this  all you can eat   sushi restaurant and this is not the 1st time going  you can say i am a regular and  today i had enough  the food is delicious but customer service was by far the worst i had ever experienced in my life  they always mix up orders  they constantly come around to fill your tea and water and they stop bringing your orders when they feel that its time for you to go  when we tried to explain how we felt about our overall experience  the  manager  did not care and her exact words were  well you still have to pay      on top of that my sister tried to tell the lady at the front register that she needed to charge her for a beverage that they missed to communicate  the lady was very rude and had no interest to listen and then realized that she forgot to charge her and started to get very unprofessional  she changed the subject on another customer who walked out because thats how bad there service was  get your act together 520sushi because i dont think anyone would tolerate such service 
my teeth whitening experience was a combination of relaxing and hysterical   amy is so personable and funny   she cracked me up and made me feel comfortable at the same time   my husband  who referred me said he slept the entire time   so amy respectfully let him snooze   but i   on the other hand was really nervous and was so happy that amy stayed in the room with me to calm me down and tell me funny stories she kept saying that she would leave me alone if i wanted her to when i told her no no  i love your stories and it made the hour fly by it felt like i was just there for 20 minutes    she stayed in the room to keep me company  she is so interesting she has traveled the whole world on a bravo reality show and is just so sweet   not to mention my teeth went from a drab yellow to a brilliant bright white  my teeth were not sensitive at all   when i am ready im definitely going to see amy asap    i highly recommend this place  
i went to the mesa location meeting air register vents of unique and various sizes  they had all of the correct sizes in stock today  i waited less than a minute at lunchtime and had outstanding customer service  staff even took the time to answer air efficiency questions  none of the big box stores had any the right sizes and special orders where complicated and expensive  even internet sites did not have right sizes  best location in arizona for odd sized ac register vents 
the pancakes are the best that i have eaten in phoenix   also it is one of our favorites in our area of town for breakfast   the owner  joe  stopped by our table to greet us and is almost always there to make sure everything is perfect   it is a great local and family owned business   we also thought the coffee was great for a breakfast place 
i really enjoyed this place   located in downtown phoenix  the selection of beers is outstanding   this is my favorite place to eat when attending a downtown event   with so many great beers  it is nice there is a beer flight of 6 samplers   the fish tacos are my choice and it is a lot of food   i would not recommend the fries with gravy    they are not good  maybe have the gravy on the side   they took the fries back  so it doesnt affect my 5 star rating 
this airline is awesome   prices are alway reasonable if you shop the prices   they have almost always been on time for us at phoenix   sometimes lines can be long  so arrive early unless you are on an early flight   gate staff is always super helpful with our stroller tags 
had a dinner meeting here   food was family style with no serving utensils   this was quite interesting   had to use other peoples unused forks for serving   we even ask for serving utensils but i guess it was ignored   the food was not my favorite  as it was overly spicy   some staff were nice and some staff were indifferent to asking for help with our meals   wont be back   other reviews seem to like the food   we were in a special room for group meetings and the arrangement of tables are just not a good fit for business meetings 
the best fast food anywhere   these chicken sandwiches are addictive   i love the family atmosphere   great place 
how is it possible ive never reviewed habaneros   ive been coming to it  and the other location  since right after arturo opened them   this is my go to place for tacos   i usually get carnitas and blackened shrimp  on corn tortillas   but my other favorite is  kaylas favorite   enchiladas with a fried egg on top    the staff is really nice  and the food is good   theres also a bar if you want beer or tequila with your tacos  burritos  enchilada  chilaquiles  whatever    give them a try 
nice to  finally  have an el pollo loco close to home   as el pollos go  this one is above average   the beans are good  my go  no go determining factor for an el pollo location      quick  tasty  affordable   whats not to love 
wow   this place   was bombay spice  has pivoted twice  and moved once  from an indian fusion concept to an indian chipotle concept to just a darned good indian restaurant   thats the history  but all that matters is the present   really great food   good service   real tandoor oven     start with samosas  then get the lamb vindaloo and an order of naan   youll be a happy camper  and youll have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow   but get another order of naan to take home    theres a really good sampler on the lunch menu  give that a go sometime  too 
a really nice menu   has the feel of a modern english pub   service is friendly and efficient   everything i have tried on the menu has been well prepared and delicious   i love the atmosphere and it is a place i will revisit from time to time   wishing mount holly could have a place like this 
loved my pasta  sauce was not overwhelming  i hate pasta that is swimming in sauce  and most importantly the bread was great  when you walk in the desserts are right there i was tempted to skip food and do dessert  i think i need to return for a martini and dessert 
was really surprised at the quality of food here  good fish and chips and literally fried right in front of you  along with a soda the tab was about  16  not bad for vegas  also  vegas strip has become just a place where you are ripped off everywhere you go  there are no deals anymore like the  8 steak and eggs midnight specials and the like  last straw for me was being charged  10 for parking per day at the hotel i had booked  am done with being gouged and will get motels from now on 
loved this place  went to dinner with here on a business trip in pittsburgh  i ordered the chili colorado  it was the most authentic mexican food i have had in years  the service was great  prompt service and our glasses were never empty  the decor was very bright and fun  i would recommend going back 
came here for dinner recently and was surprised by how expensive everything on the menu was   a  17 veggie burger  come on   turns out  the portions are huge  unless you have the worlds biggest appetite i would suggest splitting a meal with a friend  once you divide by two  the prices are actually reasonable  though  the food was fine  but nothing earth shattering  id be more likely to come back here for a drink  night out than for dinner 
great brunch place with a huge selection of breakfast and lunch options  their portions here are huge  their pancakes are to die for  they are airy  fluffy and vanillay  and thats coming from someone who doesnt enjoy cakes to start out my day  im more of a meat and potatoes fan   the staff is super friendly and well trained  even when they are slammed  the prices are reasonable  and their patio is a fantastic option for a nice day 
service was poor  food wasnt great  i would much rather go to texas roadhouse for nearly that same price  wont be going back 
i love this place  the technicians are nice and informative  they dont push anything on you  they are also very clean   ive had shellac before but always the next day it chips  but betty did my nails and 3 days later no chipping  i love it  great products  quick   efficient  will definitely be back 
this place is soooo great  my boyfriend comes here for the pho  but i come here for everything else  they even have vegetarian options that are really good  try the lotus   shrimp salad  omg  the sunrise pizza appetizer with ahi tuna   avocado is delicious  everything is well thought out and cooked to perfection  highly recommended 
wouldnt trust anyone near my eyes but uliana  gorgeous  lashes every time   her new location is beautiful  convenient  spotless   comfortable   ive recommended her to everyone thats complimented me on her amazing work   definitely worth checking out the experience she creates 
this is the worst place i have ever tried i swear i think i seen a roach crawling on the wall it is disgusting the food is nasty the guy world that i tried smell sour when i open the container and i was not pleased at all this is probably the worst place you could ever try i would suggest you never go there
wow     great coffee   in my building      just talked to chris and aaron   theyve been open in the paradise village office park for a couple of weeks  but they just moved into the atrium where i could see them   the way to judge if a place has great artisanal coffee is to order an espresso  they served it in a real cup  with a sparkling water chaser   off to a great start   the espresso was great   the barista  aaron  has been pulling shots for 10 years  and it shows  the buildings atrium is a really nice place to sit and enjoy a cup   with several seating areas and free wi fi   if youre near the corner of cactus and tatum  mosey on over to paradise village office park  south of the walmart  kitty corner from the car wash   park by either entrance  and come on in 
we found hiro from shiro   hes now working at tokyo lobby in glendale   
like snooze a m   but closer to home   this is a cool breakfast spot   modern takes on all kinds of traditional items   7 or 8 variations of eggs benedict  try the chilaquiles    trendy french toast  sweet potato pancakes   whats not to love     we went on sunday  right about noon    are you kidding   itll take an hour or two to get seated at a breakfast place at noon on sunday   came the protests from the youngest   they said about 20 minutes  and we were seated in 15   cool retro atomic themed interior  very pleasant servers  tasty options  including lots of gluten free items    give snooze a try     its totally worth putting up with the kierland parking situation 
theres an outdoor seating area  which is nice  the interiors are simply beautiful  and theres a bar and tv where espn is playing  sometimes a musician is playing in the corner with a guitar and usually hes okay  the place is not usually packed on weekdays  but the weekends and friday nights are pretty full  if you have a large group of people  i recommend reservations  the waiters up front are really nice  the kids menus have super cute triangular prism shaped crayons  the food is great too  chips and salsa come free  for an appetizer  i like the hatch catch  which is a little bit of everything  crab cakes  fried tortilla chips  and grilled prawns with a really good lobster dip  i tried the corn chowder  but i found it overbearingly sweet  it was good for the first ten spoons  but afterwards it was too much sweetness  at least for my taste   one minus is the greasiness of the food  its not too bad  but bad enough to make you feel like you just came out of mcdonalds  overall  i like the atmosphere  and the food  for me  is a hit or miss    
if you need a grandpa figure in your life  look no further  youll be greeted by the most adorable old man who will pull up a chair to your table and take your order  he will tell you that you need to order the lentil soup  and youll agree that lentil soup will be one of the best lentil soups youve ever had  dont come here if you want quick  fast service  this is a place deserving of your time  ive been here countless times  and cant recommend it enough  its a great place to bring friends and family if they are coming from out of town  i have yet to order something on the menu that i didnt enjoy  the belly dancer has a nice attitude and shell interact with guests as much as she can  which makes for great entertainment 
the most worst of all supermarkets compare foods the name should say compare prices cuase if you do this place is over priced do not i repet do not go in this supermarket and spend your hard ern cash or food stamps you will be getting jerked all the way to the cashier   
one of the best happy hours in vegas  food and drinks were great and the service at the bar was no different 
no coffee pot in the rooms    and then charge  5 for a cup of coffee that you wait in line for 15 minutes to get  in addition  in my 3 day stay i was hounded like 7 times to buy a timeshare for this place  those were the most disappointing aspects  of this stay  its not a bad hotel  but i wouldnt want to stay here again for the 2 reasons listed above 
its the in n out of chicken   if that makes sense  its delicious  cheap  and the service is great 
we were up here visiting from the bay area and i found this place on yelp because my child demanded rice and beans  the journey to this place was well worth the drive    everything was amazing and the garlic house salsa is like crack   best tacos ive had hands down 
david came out less than 24 hours after calling for an appointment to fix my microwave   he was extremely knowledgeable  professional  diagnosed the problem and provided an estimate in a few minutes   he had the part on the truck and was able to fix the microwave for an extremely reasonable price   i would highly recommend his company for appliance repair  thanks david 
exceptional service  food  and adult beverage selections  i would highly recommend going very hungry 
i walked in with only one person in front of me in line  everyone else in the place already had their order  the service was so slow  i literally waited 25 minutes for one small original bowl  it was delicious but not worth waiting almost a half hour 
i like this coffee shop  the chocolate cappuccino tasted great and the presentation was very pleasant too  a nice alternative on the strip   the shop itself is styled in an artisinal fashion  nicely done
fantastic   trendy  modern interior    very  warehouse  with exposed pipes    and friendly staff   i had  yet another  groupon for this place and my stylist was terrific  pizzo    she wasnt terribly chatty  but was knowledgeable and  chill    i enjoyed every moment of my haircut  wash  colour gloss  and style  during the setting of my gloss application  pizzo gave me a hand massage   nice   i actually believe ill be making a return visit here   without  groupon   one great haircut can last months    my line of reasoning for returning to a  fancier  place   of course  all the products used here are aveda  which only adds to the luxuriousness     
i dont know what else to add that hasnt already been covered   this made to order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience   watching the ice pan folks slap your  non dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show   of course  all the while youre watching  youre wishing that the process would just hurry up a bit because you really want your dessert   choose from your choice of dairy milk or non dairy milk  then select your choice of flavour  then decide upon the topping s    no preservatives or additives  except what may be in the toppings    oreos  reese pb cups  etc   and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes    i timed it      its too bad that one has to fight through the harrahs smoky casino to get to ice pan  but its worth it   be prepared to wait a while  we checked out ice pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue  it still took about 15 minutes for the ice pan folks to start our order   we forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though     
my friend bought a pre loaded card at costco wayyyy back and wanted to use the card   do i want to try go karting   ok   let me state first that i have never go karted before   i had a great time and was glad the place wasnt crowded  we went during the week during the mid afternoon    cost   25  race  each race lasts 10 minutes    mandatory headsocks available for  2 each  can bring these next visit    lockers are  0 50   there were a couple of vending machines with the usual products for the usual jacked up prices   the track itself wasnt extremely complicated  see photos    prior to racing  we had to watch a safety video  no bumping    green pedal is the gas pedal  red is the brake  etc     then we chose our helmets  small through xxl  and gloves and were directed to our karts   the place looked clean enough and the staff were really nice   i cant imagine doing this in the summer   theres a lot of heat generated by the karts   definitely go during the winter   this would be a fun group outing during the holidays if you wanted to spend some christmas cash   wear closed toe shoes   no sandals  flip flops allowed 
how can you not like made to order burgers with asian flair   my kalbi burger    angus beef marinated in kalbi sauce with kimchi    was delicious   hubbys ronin burger    angus beef  caramelized onions  japanese coleslaw  and a fried egg    was colourful and juicy   we thoroughly enjoyed our selections  despite an unusually long wait for our fries  20 min     no explanation as to why the fries were missing       check out bachi for a fun fusion experience 
my little group of hardcore hikers was ravenous by the time we got back to our cars    how bout some drinks and snacks at bonnie springs   suggested one girl   the cafe boasted a firepit at the very front and we all snagged some prime seating around it  the firepit is lit starting at sundown  so our timing was impeccable   super cozy and relaxing   as for food  my pulled pork sandwich was devoured in seconds   it hit the spot   while it wasnt the best sandwich ive ever eaten    the sauce was rather one dimensional in flavour and overpowered everything in the sandwich    it did the trick   our server was super nice and accommodating and we enjoyed the cafes wild west charm   prices werent as expensive as i expected  my sandwich  and fries  came to  9 99   pretty reasonable for a touristy place 
a friend and i decided to check out this place after work since it was close  as the name suggests  the attic is not found on the ground floor  walk up the stairs to the second floor and youll find the attic  the sign that greets you says to seat yourselves  so we chose prime seats on the patio overlooking camelback mountain  happy hour is 4 6 30pm  mondays through fridays  and features  2 off all appetizers   1 50 off beer by the glass  and  2 off wine by the glass  the beer selection changes frequently and theres a decent wine list  i got a moscato and my friend got a cider   for food  we ordered the fish tacos  a bit cold  and the bruschetta with pancetta  good flavor  but a bit cold   service was fair  not awful  not stellar    solid place to hang out after work  i will probably come here again to try one of their burgers and to enjoy the patio 
the red devil is a family owned restaurant that offers italian comfort food  i came here a few months ago for a co workers birthday lunch and found my first visit satisfactory  i ordered the hawaiian personal size pizza and it was savory and tasty  albeit a bit soggy  portions are large and value is pretty good  lunch specials range in price from  6 49 to  9 49  nothing about the red devil  wowed  me  but its a solid place in central phoenix for diet busting italian comfort food that wont break the bank 
who doesnt know about panda express   i have to admit  i first patronized this place because of the cute panda mascot   now  i find myself searching for pe when i want a quick asian style hit   it is what it is and sometimes the food could be fresher   but  if you know what youre getting and not expecting 5  authentic chinese cuisine  then youll probably be happy 
wonderful customer service this place is on the up and coming right now  the owner makes you feel happy about your investment rather then feeling like you made a bad decision  they also have a really good referral program see for your self     
recently moved to the arcadia area and was blown away by urban wax  from being taken back right on time  an amazing eyebrow wax with nicole  and an all around fun  cute and clean experience   this place was truly top notch  to top it all off  my wax was free as a first time client  this is my new regular spot for sure 
this place is a haven in reno  ever since i moved here from los angeles  the change of weather has ruined my skin  hair  and even increased my sinuses more than they already were  i came across reverse aging and tried the medical grade infrared saunas and after only 4 30 45 minute sessions theres a world of difference  my skin is softer  cleaner  less dry  and ive even lost some weight  also  i have a torn acl in my right knee and a strained rotator cuff in my right shoulder and the time i spend in the sauna really minimizes the pain  i know a lot of people on here say that the owner dianne is a little off but i personally think her passion for her job and business is so high that people misunderstand her  i hate homeopathic stuff and oils and all that and she doesnt push it on you  shes knowledgable and respectful and is a wonderful person to know in the community  im so sad ill be moving in august   
4 plus stars  which is darn good for a chain   nice decor  good service an large tasty portions   i had the  9 99 chicken chalupa lunch    most items on the menu are  12  15   it is definitely worth a try   i have attached a photo of my entree 
saw this on yelp and would say that that the food was definitely worth the rating  had the grilled chicken sandwich  the chicken breast was thick  moist and tender  served with pineapple and a special tangy sauce   i also ordered the rumbi fries which is a combination of regular and sweet potato fries served with russian dressing  all in all  very good  prompt and friendly service   about  8 85 for meal  excluding beverage 
the first thing that impressed me was that soyo isnt an ayce place   not that ayce places are bad   ive just visited places that boast ayce and the quality just falls under my  snobby  standards   soyo is super cute on the inside  with twinkling lights  a  price is right  style spinning wheel  and signs in hangul  and we all know that printed hangul is super cute  what with all the  sticks and circles    hubbys words    in that particular written language      our party of 4 snagged a booth and ordered a variety of delights  bibimbap  fried chicken  chapchae  etc   barley tea was flowing liberally  the banchan was plentiful and tasty  and hubby got his fill of kimchi to last for the next few weeks   everything was delicious and the sweet  if slightly clueless server  was more than happy to bring us drink refills and napkins  after reminding him several times    it was nice not to have our clothes saturated with bbq smoke after our meal  something that is a given at ayce bbq places ive patronized     i will definitely come here again to eat and to spin that wheel 
needed to stay here for business and got this place on priceline for cheap   the name of the property implies a fancypants resort  but the reality is something that  was  fancypants in the late 80s   im guessing that there isnt enough   to remodel   anyhow  my room was clean  the front desk clerk who checked me in was very charming  and the pool very pretty  complete with a little waterfall   little  being the operative adjective  and a lovely view of the golf course on which the property is located     if i got another sweet deal on priceline for this place  id stay here   i wasnt offended by the archaic decor   i would get rid of the resort fee  as guests should have access to the propertys amenities as part of their room rate   sheesh   4  for overall impression less 1  for decor and resort fee   3 
such a bummer  started out being a nice quaint dinner with a very good antipasto salad  then came the stuffed artichoke that we tried to gag down  then the entrees  wife and mother in law had the shrimp parmesiano that was horrific  nothing parmesiano about it  was in some greasy oil concoction  ache returned to the kitchen  i had the shrimp joe something that had the same sauce as the parmesiano  blech to say the least  will not be going back 
had a really fun time  purchased the unlimited pass  was able to bowl  play laser tag  and complete the ropes course several times over  good was average  beer was cold  a good experience  overall 
worst  california rolls ive ever eaten  wrong type of rice  theyre the size of uncooked rice i opened my togo box and omg  smelled soooo fishy  the crab meat was all shredded not a chunk of crab and pieces of avocado were tiny  texture of mush  there were no equal size proportions  ratio  tiny sliver of avocado ton of shredded crab  very little rice  did i mention the smell     really disappointing 
i saw this place was opening at northlake and decided to give it a try tonight with my roommate   first of all   the wait   we arrived a little after 7 00pm on a friday night and we waited in line for over 40 minutes   its a quick service restaurant similar to chipotle  so i was wondering why the wait was so incredibly long   maybe they are working out kinks   we finally get up the counter and like most build your pizza shops  we chose our crust  our sauce  our toppings  etc   the service was extremely disappointing   i dont know if it was just a bad night  but i soon found out why the line was so incredibly long   the workers moved at a snails pace   whether it was putting on sauce or toppings   they were overly meticulous with everything and in a quick service restaurant  in my opinion  thats not needed   pizzas were backing up and the line became quickly jammed   in total  it took us almost an hour and a half from the time we arrived to the time we left   for a restaurant of this style  this is unacceptable    the pizza itself was good  but nothing to write home about   this place does have a coke freestyle machine which is a plus   i may visit again down the road  im not sure   but only to see if theyve trained their employees better   speed and efficiency are key for a place like this 
top tier among fast food places   food is excellent   the service is courteous and fast   animal style is the way to go for both burger and fries   just need to get one of these to open up in the midwest 
i must say that this evening is tough to forget  food  atmosphere  service and price    we had starters  labni  falafel and roasted cauliflower  all were stunning  but if i had to pick one  the edge goes to the cauliflower  stunning sauce with lemon juice  decadent  but full respect to the falafel and labni   my son went with the lamb and beef on rice  he says hell eat it again   and again  my wife the chicken kebabs on rice   same comment   i had grilled egg plant on rice  cant understand how it tasted so great    the rice is not just rice  the lentils in the rice take it to a whole other level  vegetarians should feel like 1st class citizens here    finishing with baklava and a warm custard fill pastry where delightful    great food  wonderful service  great staff  reasonable price  always finish with lebanese coffee  cardamom and strong coffee are an excellent finish 
i had the fungi pizza  my spouse the pizza with asparagus  lunchtime  not busy  but business being done  staff plentiful  professional and friendly    pizza may be on the low end of cuisine for some  but i have to say this was one of the best ive had  ive even had pizza in ny city    the fungi pizza was accented with truffle oil and just the right amount of fresh  tasty arugula   the pizza with asparagus was absolutely devine    sparkling water by the bottomless carafe for a buck 50      atmosphere is high classy  style without stiff  jazz playing  lighting low but not moody    ill be back  ill recommend and ill spread the word 
i got to dannys family car wash at 11 20 today   it is 12 45 as i write this and my car is still not finished   i did not order a detail or anything out of the ordinary  just a  works  car wash   this place is sooooo sloooowww   ive been coming here for way too long  i swear this is my last time 
let me start by saying i shouldve listened to the previous reviews  service was terrible chicken was raw had to send back twice  needless to say i left hungry  broken beer bottles all over the bathroom with an employee just walking by  very disappointed drove two hours to get there   never again 
absolutely love this place  from the environment to the location  food and the employees  its always a great time here at freddys  definitely a must place to eat at 
not worth the wait  was pretty disappointed to have stood in line for 1 cannoli and 1 lobster tail  only to have spent  10 on not that great tasting treats  not sure if it was just my pallet but the lobster tail was very bland  the cannoli was over creamed  probably enjoyed the first bite of each and was immediately sick of it afterwards    if youve never had anything from this bakery  definitely try it  they have a great way of branding the name  not to mention buddys restaurant is directly across the hall  might try that place sometime  other than that  i would take a hard pass on this bakery next time 
stopped in to get their signature cubano sandwich  enlightened to find a amazingly friendly staff  upon looking around while waiting for our sandwiches i noticed their cool venesualen decor  and several awards  when my sandwich arrived i realized why  hands down the best cubano sandwich ive ever had in my life  with amazing crispy plantain chips  this experience has changed my life  thank you so much la taguara  please keep it up and never change  we will be life time customers for sure  cant wait to try the arepas
service was good  a bit under staffed  the restaurant  bar in the lobby is a place to see and be seen  the location of the hotel is magnificent 
garbage   if your looking for show quality   look elsewhere these people have a  drunk russian  attitude and are very amateur  i took 4 wheels to them to have them polished  quoted me  715 00  they told me 1 1  2 weeks  it took 4 weeks  the rims are  work emotion  brand  a high end  premium wheel made in japan  that where originally powder coated white   instead of chemical stripping the wheels  they used a heavy coarse blast media that pitted the metal on 2 of the rims that can still be seen after they polished them  those 2 wheels need 15 plus 1  4oz weights to get balanced  and then they grind off all the labels  these are 1  4in raised label that says  work   work emotion   made in japan    its simple  if you have a snap on wrench and you grind off the label and polish the wrench   is that still a snap on wrench   can you sell the wrench at snap on value   wtf     why would you grind off the emblem     they ruin my wheels  when i picked up the wheels  my frustration was clear   after 20 minutes of arguing i gave up  paid  500 and left    very shinny the wheels  you know like    very nice these wheels yeah   no  no  you ruin my wheels bro  
unfortunately we havent been able to get back recently but we have gone a few times since my original review  ive been meaning to update but keep forgetting      so here we go     sushi koma is still our go to place  every time we visit we walk out happy and our tummies are even happier    the staff is just as friendly as can be  the food has never been a disappointment  we have recommended sushi koma to lots of people and always get good feed back  keep doing what youre doing   we look forward to our next visit 
most people have heard of smashburger  so this review will be short and sweet   every time ive visited a smashburger location  my burger has been tasty  hot  and smashed thin  per the name   i always get a yelp check in discount  which is a perk  and service is usually good   smashburger is a little higher end than most fast food chains  as the ingredients used are a bit nicer and the quality of the burgers higher   this place is good for a cheap burger fix that wont make you feel too guilty about indulging 
as a vegas local  visiting the stratosphere was on my list of things  to do later       im not a huge fan of the strip  mainly because im impatient and waiting for the numerous lights to change whilst driving does a number on my blood pressure   anyway    a friend and i took advantage of the january locals deal  free tower entry with nv id on weekends  and decided to check out the top of the strat  which apparently is the tallest freestanding observation tower in the us   the view is good but i would not have paid  18 to experience it   however  during our time on the observation floor  we got to witness a brave lady throw herself off of the tower  skyjump controlled free fall  its  109 99 per jump   after which we did not see her again    im sure shes fine    we also got to see the other rides in motion and hear screams of delight  i think      one can purchase ride packages  buy solo ride tickets  or just live vicariously through others ride experience   glad i went up the tower and more glad that i didnt have to pay any   to do it 
hubby got me a 3 month membership for my birthday and i just had my first massage last week   first  the details  the membership gets you one massage  month or one facial  month plus an unlimited number of massages and facials you can ever want to purchase at membership prices    one hour massage at member rate is  39 and one hour facial at member rate is  49    my massage was great  no complaints   relaxing and effective    what i want in a massage   the front desk staff really push their products  membership program and seem less experienced as front desk staff than other comparable places ive visited   for instance  the young guy who was assisting me couldnt locate my file and took about 5min to find it  during which time another staff person asked me if i would fill out the patient info form  not realizing i just did that with the guy who was looking for my form    those 2 staff people were sitting right beside each other and the place was not busy    only 1 other customer who was being helped by a third staff person    so  customer service a bit slow on the uptake  but the actual massage was good   ill have to update this review after my 3 month membership expires 
awesome juices and acai bowls are the best   excellent service   the avocado toast is delicious and with a little extra salt its exceptional   i am not crazy about the smoothies though 
went on the weekend and it was empty  i dont know why though  this place is legit   pretzel bread and pimento cheese is complimentary  that stuff is bomb  i had to get another    iced sweet green tea  had 3 cups  it was that good  dont waste your time drinking anything else   husband and i shared meat and 3 sides and a pudding cup  it was enough food  but did not look like it would be  the mac   cheese disappointed us  thin sauce and the cheese wasnt funky enough  butternut squash grew on me and i devoured the whole ramekin  husband liked the green beans  but i didnt like them  they did have a fresh texture  the brisket came out soaking in its juices  but dried out quickly  the nutella pudding cup was the best  hint of saltiness similar to fudge in the top layer  silky smooth chocolate on the bottom layer  served with a snickerdoodle which made it even better  not just for garnish   so although i was not thrilled with some items the other ones knocked me off my feet  i would pay to have that pretzel bread with cheese and the iced tea  i know people think its a tad expensive  but the food is high quality  i think we spent  27 and didnt have leftovers  that isnt bad  i also have to say that the service was good too  they checked on us many times and offered us that second helping of pretzel bread while we ate  i will return 
this place used to be so good but the food quality in both the burgers and fries are now disappointing  i dont know what they changed but nothing tastes the way it did before 
i was very disappointed in our experience at the statehouse   the host and waiter seemed inexperienced and lacked the professionalism i would expect in a restaurant of this nature   we were seated at a table so small there wasnt enough room for our food despite the fact that there were plenty of larger tables for 2 available   we had reservations but no choice in where we sat   the drinks were terrible   i sent my lemon drop martini back as it appeared to be nothing more than flavored vodka  our waiter acted irritated that i sent it back  my wife ordered a cosmo that had a nasty aftertaste   the food was mediocre  the beef tenderloin was a good quality cut of meat but it was under cooked   my wife ordered braised ribs with root vegetables  the ribs were ok but the root vegetables were nearly raw and almost impossible to eat   the waiter was inattentive and indifferent  we were over half finished with our meals before he asked how our food was  we had to ask for both the drinks menu and the desert menu   the only positive thing i can say is that the mashed potatoes were delicious   needless to say  we wont be going back 
gwen is an absolute rock star   she really knows the business   if you are looking for a professional and knowledgeable realtor  that listens  is always accessible  is a strong negotiator and is very personable  then you must go with gwen  
sarah was very professional and i would highly recommend her to anyone  shes an electronically genius  p s  ask her to honor deals in house because she will give you a better price    thanks for your fast service sarah 
saigon pho has some of the best vietnamese food i have ever had    their lemon grass chicken is spicy  but oh so good  their thai iced tea is not watered down like other places    the staff here is quick on the order  patient  and super friendly 
great food  this place is cozy  and had water  flat bread  and 3 sauces ready to go at our table when we sat down   staff was just the right amount of attentive  price was quite reasonable for the amount of food we got   favorite indian place i have gone to in phoenix 
i was really craving pizza one day at work  so i decided to try this pizza hut one more time  i ordered by 10am they said pizza would be there by 10 40  but pizza wasnt there until 11 30    avoid this place if possible 
ill keep this short and sweet    best arts theater in the valley  if you are any sort of film biff  this theater will have what you want before it goes to the mainstream theater or to filmbar    prices are the same as any other harkins  food is the same  seats are the same  all in all this is a run of the mill theater    however  independent and foreign movies is their forte here  if you want to see this movies as soon as you can in the valley  then you have to head to camelview    unfortunately  it is set to close sometime over the next year 
location is nice if you live or go to school at asu  otherwise it is a bit of a pain to get to with traffic    location itself is super sleek and clean  big space with plenty of seating to chose from    however  it goes down hill from there  i got the half greens and half brown rice  they set the greens off separately to mix  which is nice  i got 3 scoops with the large   which was nice  and all the normal options were there  salmon  tuna  spicy tuna  scallops  etc   next was the sauce  and this is where things went down    i asked the employee which one he recommended between the two spicy  he said mix both  so i went with it  he added the sauce and mixed them  albeit not well since the fish all ended up on the bottom     next were the toppings  i went with a good variety  but the first thing i noticed was how haphazard they threw it in my plate  one of the things i like the most about these bowls is how meticulous they are  each is a work of art  slowly crafted to satiate  there was a lot behind me  but only a few people  and all i wanted was a few extra seconds to be sure my cucumbers were not strewn about    i go to check out  and the price was comparable to most other places  they didnt offer me any of the macaroons when i checked out  and i didnt even notice they were there until after     i sit down to eat  and the sauce was just overpowering everything  the sesame seeds tasted odd  the brown rice was a bit hard  and the overall presentation was not up to snuff  the leftover oil was just too much to bare looking at my empty plate    the fish  when not drenched in sauce  was of good quality  and honestly that saved this review    knowing me  ill head back again one day  ask for super easy sauce  only greens  and see if it is any better 
ill start with the only negative  i didnt know this place existed when i lived 10 minutes away  now i live 30    food is fresh and delicious  saturday morning they have a great smoked salmon bagel special that they usually run out of by 1pm  ill have to make a special trip back for that    ive been here a handful of times and tried a handful of the bowls  all were delicious  they house made limeade was lovely  service was great  location was clean  honestly what more can you ask for 
worst sports bar i have ever been too  service was terrible and the food was overrated  the fries we ordered were cold and the burger that we got was under cooked with blood coming out if it and when i tried to take it back the waitress gave me such a hard time about it  dont waste your money here 
during a road trip from texas through new mexico and arizona   i realized that we should have a better camera than our cell phones  i wanted my first time at sedona and the grand canyon to be properly captured and my iphone 6 plus was not up to the job  so our search began in scottsdale and ended at wilson camera   we met the owner rudy and his wife misty  they were very nice  i was not aware of all the factors that can make or break a cameras  functionality  rudy made sure that i understood how i wanted to use the camera by questioning my expectations  he then gave me a range of options in all price ranges that would best fit my needs  after i chose the right camera  misty worked hard to link up the technology  blue tooth and wifi options  to my phone  pretty awesome that an app will location tag my photos when i take them with my camera   i am sad that wilson camera is over 1000 miles away  i would definitely recommend them your business  i have become accustomed to doing business from a keyboard and forgot how real customer service enhances the transaction  i cant guarantee that all face to face business awill be a pleasant affair but at wilson camera  you will be treated like an old friend   i am very happy with my purchase   thanks you rudy and misty 
great customer service and they got ok service department  nice new location also 
really great food   good chicken  fresh veggies  delicious juicy rice  the service was also great  and this is definitely a spot to check out if youre in the neighbourhood 
i went here to get my ring reshaped  it got ran over by a car    they did a quick reshape to the best of his ability allowing it to be  free   i paid the actually amount to get it shaped better and cleaned  its back into an almost perfect circle with very little wear and tear on the ring instead    cheap  affordable and quick 
plenty of stores at aurora farms premium outlets and you can find majority of brand name stores  more importantly  there is something for everyone  the stuff ranges from clothes  toys  books  chocolate to entertainment system and housewares    love the outlet layout  it seems pretty spread out  oh and you can feed the ducks because there is a pond   1 for that  typical food court like any other malls so not much to say there  overall  aurora farms is certainly a great alternative to air conditioned department stores  would you get better deals than regular shopping malls  not usually as it depends on when you visit the outlet 
i went to best buy to use their geek squad because i purchased it there   big mistake   i would never recommend the geek squad to anyone   i was lied to several times with what was going on with my computer  hours of time spent trying to see what they were doing  and no return call from supervisor after promised mr  kemp would call    in summary   they held my computer until my warranty expired  a month  then told me they couldnt get a mother board from hp but i could exchange the computer   i want my computer   i called hp and they said they had the mother board and not sure why geeks were telling me this  or why they cancelled the request for mother board a week before they told me not available   i requested the computer back  and its been 2 weeks waiting for them to release my computer back to me     still dont have  and every call i make which is daily  i get different information and long waits on the calls   the store staff is worthless to help and geek squad even more so  as they dont keep the online information current or helpful   i should have sent to hp direct  and not messed with these incompetent people   very upset and frustrated with this service  walk away from the geek squad   if i could rate them a negative number  i would 
im not sure why this place has so many bad reviews  but i will continue with mine   i came here on a saturday night after a friends dinner   my other friend invited me for half off drinks  its located right above yard house near the rave theaters which helps with parking if you parked near h m  anyways  the music here is a mix of everything  i love variety  the happy hour menu was alright  but disappointed me because my favorite drink  amf  was not on the menu  the crowd here is aimed towards the young crowd  but thats fine with me  the dance floor is pretty much wherever you make it and you can even play beer pong  they have an outside patio which allows for more conversation amongst people   all in all  i will definitely be back here 
how have i not written a review about this place yet   im here at least once a week  when you pair up good food with even better prices   how am i not here even more    the ayce kbbq prices for both lunch and dinner beat the rest  i mean  13 99 between 10 00pm to closing and then  16 99 any other time  you cant compete with that    you  just  cant   their appetizers will prepare your mouth for the glorious meat youll eat  my favorite is the korean pancake and tofu  their house salad is also amazing  i have contemplated endless times to see if i could do a pick up order on just their salad alone   as for their meats  my favorite would be the good ofashion pork belly  the brisket follows and then maybe the marinated pork belly  if youre extremely hungry  go ahead and order their steamed egg  its a perfect combo with the rice   the only reason why this place is 1 star away from a perfect 5 is their size  i really wish it was bigger  half of the restaurant is divided so it can be a long gruesome wait if you come at the wrong time 
shout out to the asian girls  let the lights dim sum    if you got a fancy for chinese food and are extremely hungry definitely check this spot out   i dont really have high expectations for chinese restaurants so this one is no exception  ive ate here twice and left both times with a belly full of food   i was never a fan of duck  but became one because of this place  i also need to add my love for shumai  if you dont have high expectations of a restaurant just give this place a shot 
if youre going to eat here  avoid the double crunch shrimp off their 2 for  24 deal  the double crunch really is double crunch  they definitely over did the frying on the shrimp along with the fries  even my boyfriend  who is a avid foodie and is pretty much easily content with any meal  found distaste in his shrimp   i ordered the bourbon street steak as ive ordered it many times before at different applebees restaurants and this time around   it tasted a little too bland for my liking  i was quite disappointed since i really do enjoy this dish   our waitress was okay  but was very awkward when we told her it was our friends birthday and asked if they did anything special  she said that can give a free dessert in which i agreed to  the dessert came towards the end of the meal  of course  but she was so awkward in delivering it  it was just her and she kind of tried to  sneak it  on the table  there was no happy birthday song from her or the staff so me and my friends kind of had to take over from there  im sure its different for a kids birthday though   i mean  my friend turned 23 so i guess they dont find the need to sing happy birthday at that age   all in all  this place falls a little below  alright  for me  ive had better experiences at other applebees  i probably wont be back here anytime soon or in the near future 
ive gone here a couple times and the food is alright  just dont compare it to the multiple buffets we have in the fancy casinos on the strip   any buffet with crab legs is a winner in my book  but for some reason the crab legs here were a little skimpy on the meat    i shouldnt work so hard to crack open a leg to find no meat inside    anyways   they offer other variety of foods here from sushi to french fries and wonton soup  they serve fruits here along with ice cream  but i did find the ice cream to taste a bit strange   if you enjoy buffet   asia then youll probably like this place as well since they both are pretty much tied in my book 
zero stars   rude staff  rundown atmosphere  overpriced  i cant think of anything positive to say about this place  would be nice if we had another choice to go roller skating   this place has no pride in their building or customer service  i miss the good old days  too bad my kids cant experience what roller rinks used to be  just go to a movie instead  trust me 
horrible food  horrible customer service  ordered a wrap with no cheese for my daughter  she has a dairy allergy which  i clearly stated when ordering  had my daughter check the wrap while we were still in the restaurant even though we were carrying out  had cheese in it so i told the girl at the register who took my order  she yelled back to the girl making the wrap    i said it has no cheese   so we waited again while the same girl remade the wrap  she gave it to me and apologized  i told her no worries  and left  big mistake   got home  still had pieces throughout   and the tortilla had the same melted cheese from before  she reused the tortilla and just picked out the big pieces of cheese   we threw it away  i just wasted  8   im just glad my kid did not eat it and have a severe allergic reaction  plenty of other restaurants who care about the quality of food  staff and customer service  wont be back 
found this place on yelp  very fun menu which made it hard to decide what to eat  so got creative  wanted a breakfast burrito but also an omelette so couldnt decide then realized they had me covered   you can turn any omelette into a burrito   got the hangover cure omelette  as a burrito  was amazing  also ordered the aunt maggie stuffed french toast  which was also spot on and very satisfying   definitely will be back to try more of the extensive menu 
the guys left without saying anything to me  they didnt say they were done  they didnt ask if the windows looked ok  nothing   i had to leave the house shortly after they left and returned after dark   the next day it was rainy and dark  it wasnt until almost 3 days later that i got to really look closely at the windows and the job was terrible   it was because it was days later that i didnt call and make any type of remarks     in some cases on the 2 story picture windows there were cob webs over the corners and they must have reached under them to wipe the windows leaving big webs intact   3 of the windows are inside a garden fence that i am certain they just didnt clean because they didnt see how the gate opened    instead of asking they just didnt do those ones but charged me none the less    i was never more disappointed with a service      i have always had my windows professionally maintained and this was by far the least professional of any ive experienced 
my favorite spot   best seats a little pricey but its the movie theatre standard  the nachos are good and they give free refill on popcorn and soda  l  sizes  however try and get your tix before you get there    you have to pick your seats and if you go at the last minute you might not get the seats you want  couple of weeks ago we went to watch guardians of the galaxy  we had to sit in the very first row  it was good that the seats are bomb and recline all the way back but seriously who watches a movie at the theatre from the first row  closest to the screen     the staff is awesome btw 
great food  great atmosphere  reasonable price  great addition to davidson  
the place was a mess from beginning to end  plates on almost every table that was not being used  the host and waiter lacked attending  the food was ok  i gave this place a second try and i waited 1 hour  never will i go back again
i found this place on yelp when i was searching for healthy options to eat while i was in vegas  i loved this place  i ate here for lunch twice during my 4 day trip  definitely a small place  in a kind of hard to find location  take the guest room elevators up to the pool floor  its right before you walk out to the pool area    i tried the breakfast wrap  sonoran scramble  grilled ahi tuna sandwich  chicken satay  and a smoothie  i love how everything is fresh and organic   i could just taste the freshness  i could even tell that the salsa was made with fresh ingredients  i loved how the breakfast meals came with a small side of fresh fruits   my favorites were the breakfast wrap  with organic eggs  veg  and sprouted whole wheat tortilla  and the open faced ahi sandwich  my least favorite was the chicken satay  it was a bit dry and the flavoring wasnt as strong as id like    i was debating between a 4 or 5 star   5 stars because i feel like its the most high quality and only organic  healthy option there is on the strip  not to mention that the food is yummy  4 stars because the portions are a bit on the smaller size for the price  although i left satisfied but not bloated  my hubby who loves to eat meat and large portions was still hungry 
this was a great experience but be prepared to spend a ton of time waiting in the heat
i have to say this car wash has been the worst  every tine we go something is missed  weve tried this place 3 times thinking maybe it will get better but it never has  car is not cleaned properly windows with spots and we had them vacuum our car again  youre not suppose to baby sit people who should be doing their job 
this is an excellent nail salon  the pedicure was great  just like an expensive spa  the staff is friendly and skilled  i will be going back 
best place in the neighborhood to study and do work  great environment  busy enough but not loud  great food  from breakfast to lunch to dessert  great service by the owner  sean  hes super friendly and makes you feel like youre going to his home  unfortunately the other workers arent as nice or enthusiastic as he is  but not a deal breaker  the food is yummy but a bit expensive  remember that the price includes tax  making people think its even more expensive   the spicy sausage is really good 
first time here  ordered the  1 combo  cheese enchilada  taco    tostada with rice   beans  salsa   chips served as the appetizer  the salsa reminded me of enchilada sauce and its spicy  have a glass of water handy  the enchilada was adequate  the taco was ground beef and tasted like it had a taco bell type seasoning in it   a huge no no for any restaurant other than taco bell   but the shell was fried true mexican style  thank goodness  next time im going to ask for a shredded beef taco  and i hear the quesadillas are excellent so there will be a next time  i also had an arnold palmer and it was one of the best ive had 
my new favorite dessert spot in chinatown lv  been waiting anxiously for this location to open across the street  so excited when the open sign came on  they spent a ton of money decorating  and spared no detail  the bathroom is even amazing  chose the oreo bingsoo and im addicted  cant wait to try the other flavors  staff was really friendly  brush up on the social media and geo tagging guys  a lot of people will want to find this place and not get mixed up with other concepts that have  snow  in the name 
this place is amazing  so fresh  full of flavor  great service  huge portions  i always do the chicken bowl with veggies  spicy hummus  and tons of other toppings   love the garlic sauce  definitely recommend 
after a burglary we needed some minor repairs and peace of mind  united provided quick service and prices lower than we expected  when one of our remote units turned up missing  we had the whole system reprogrammed to render it useless and a replacement that i did not have to hunt down  i have never needed this type of service before  but should i ever need it again  it would be an easy decision 
wonderful staff  really clean rooms and a great casino     really the only downside was having our six year old along for the ride   not as kid friendly as mandalay bay   would be perfect otherwise   
one of the places that i will go if i just dont feel like making dinner is this sprouts  i like their sandwich bar a lot  and its always fresh  buying some macaroons to go with is nice too     i am however marking them as a 3 stars for service  on a few different visits  i have had the staff seem very uninterested in making my meal  and  gave the attitude like it was not really part of their job 
had a reservation at 7 45pm this evening  in town for sema   am in town for work and bring clients  got sat outside  no problem  8 15 rolled around  still no service  no water  no your server will be right with you  8 25 i finally found and told the server that weve been waiting for a long time and she said itd be a while  so we had to leave and go to the strip  i was excited to go downtown and have a nice steak and bottle of wine meal but it ended real quickly with no service   very upset that i didnt get to try the place  i understand being busy but i also think you should be able to get someone water and at least say hello and acknowledge them 
have had 3 of our cars windows tinted here they do an awesome job best part they give you a lifetime warranty on the window tints if anything goes wrong do to normal use they will replace it free of charge only bad thing you do have to make an appointment they are usually busy  tried to stop by one day i was close but they were booked and didnt have anything opened until the following week 
the service was mediocre   beef carpacio was great   we ordered the seafood menu for two  it was not worth the  65 we paid  they burned pretty much all the seafood  the scallops had burned grill marks on them  as well as the salmon  the veggies that came with it were bitter and undertook in regards to the carrots and cauliflower   i probably wouldnt go back again for the over  100 we spent 
my friends and i were enjoying an evening in kensington market  and decided to make several stops around the area    fries with a twist    why not    we tried the japo frites  which is basically fries topped with a bunch of dried seaweed  a drizzle of wasabi mayo  and a sprinkle of sesame seeds  it is such a simple combination of ingredients and it was very tasty  however  the fries were pretty greasy and on top of that  the toppings were not layered  so by the time we reached the middle  we were left with greasy topping less fries   i like the concept  but i gotta say   for what it is  i think it is overpriced 
one of the most magical places on earth  and certainly my favorite place in champaign urbana    if youre into crafting  diying  or just tend to macgyver your way through life  this is definitely the place for you   there is always something new and awesome to discover here  whether youre looking for a specific item or tool to complete a project or are open to being inspired by whatever they happen to have in stock that day  you surely wont be disappointed    i can also strongly recommend volunteering here  if you have a bit of free time to spare  it is so satisfying to help sort through   organize their donations  and a lot of fun to see all the cool stuff that comes in everyday 
service  the manager debbie should be fired  my friend and i were there saturday after the jazz festival  the mgr debbie stated the restaurant is booked up for the night so if we wanted dinner we had to seat at the bar  so we sat at the bar  well time passed over an hour and now we see people coming in with no reservation and being seated  i was livid that the mgr  of all people i felt racially profiled me and my friend  i brought to debbie attention of how first of all when seats became available as a mgr that told us to sit at the bar  we should have been the first people to be seated  i felt disrespected as a patron this establishment and felt since i was african american it was ok to be treated as such  the fact that a manager could act rudely as such is horrible for this restaurant

i cant say enough good things about mathease  we now have both our students enrolled and both are in honors and magnet schools   this started with our oldest in honors geometry and failing the class  we tried getting help from the teacher and she was zero help  she actually recommended online courses  we had two choices  move our honors student to another class or get serious help immediately  mathease was recommended highly and wow were they right    they went into overdrive helping our child who was really upset as we had never had a tutor before   we found that many honors kids were going there and our child saw several classmates which helped her feel right at ease  her grades started improving very quickly and within about 3 weeks she went from lost to bs  she kept up the work and pulled that f up to a b average for the semester  our other daughter saw all the improvements and wanted in as well  she crushed her mid term with a perfect 100  and an overall a  yes we are now biased but that doesnt mean we are wrong  ask your child if they think they need help and if they even hesitate with their answer  call katy and get them scheduled  
ordered a cab  waited 30 minutes and was then called back to let me know that they didnt have any cabs in the area  really  it took you 30 min to figure that out  called ace taxi and they never showed up after 30 min  so i canceled because i was going to miss my prepaid for show  come on cleveland 
this place is really good    the best hamburgers ive had so far    i would definitely visit this place again  the place is clean and the service was good too  no complaints    i wish there was one in northern cali    
now everybody clap your hands   clap clap clap clap    while having brunch  the electric slide song came on  and everyone was singing along and dancing  we were def in vegas    we came here after being to hash house a go go in san diego  we were craving the bloody mary  and was a little disappointed when we got it  it was good  but didn t have as much flavor as the location in sd    portions are big  food is alright 
stopped in today for the first time for a quick lunch  the atmosphere is nice and it looks recently remodeled  the hoagie i had was absolutely delicious  the bread they used was great  i see a lot of reviews saying they are cash only  but i used a credit card here  the guy said it was recent that they added the card machine   the service was great as well and they were super friendly  will definitely be back to try the pizza 
genuinely good  friendly people serving up some bomb ass tacos on the cheap 
had high hopes since its the only ice cream on uber eats   got several pints and its not inexpensive but willing to pay since its literally ice cream at my front door     didnt like any of the flavors   not just didnt like but it was bad  pistachio was so salty  not sure if it was a bad batch or this is normal  literally tasted lime they dumped salt on top  dark chocolate was not at all sweet and just tasted bad   and the peanut butter was edible but wasnt great and we didnt save any of them    too bad  was hoping this would be a regular delivery   it was however delivered quickly  cold and not melted so that was good  but i guess thats more due to uber eats 
i do not like writing bad reviews unless i have several bad experiences   i live just next door of this bar   i enjoy the patio a lot but      the servers  ladies three of them  clearly have emotional and attitude issues  they are rude  hardly smile and lets be honest they make the situation uncomfortable  plus take years to get the drinks   plus they try to trick you with the bill   happened twice   one day i told one of them out of the blue  you should let him go      she was in shock because yes i guessed she was pissed by his relationship and for instance giving me  and other customers a crappy service   i hope the owner and these waitresses read this review  i would fire these two girls i will not say names but you know who you are girls   the other servers even the bartender males are such attentive and nice individuals  congratulations to them   peace
great group of guys  jordan  martin and matthew  came and helped us move  they were very polite and had open communication on what we needed to be done  we have a toddler and they were great with working with us through the kids nap times and meal times  i would hire them again for any type of moving in the future 
got my usual order of rare beef pho  the pho itself was okay but i got a little surprise in my bean sprout dish  the lime wedge had teeth marks all over it and it was clearly used  i was abhorred to find them  recycling  the bean sprout dish  when i confronted the waitress  she had the audacity to lie and said it was bad slicing by the cook  i pointed out that i saw teeth mark  she didnt even apologize  urgh never going there ever again 
i bought concert tickets from momentum tickets  not because i chose to but  b  c that was where i was redirected to by live nation  ticketmaster  i am so disappointed   i chose lawn seats which are generally quite affordable  i saw that the ticket prices were  54  each which i thought was a bit much  but agreed to it b  c its zac brown band and i love them  the total for my order ended up being over  145    i understand that they are a  for profit  company but this was a bit extreme  i paid over  30 in  service fees  and like  15 in  delivery fees   even though they were e tickets  seems a bit much for tickets that are e mailed to you   i finally downloaded the tickets about a week before the concert  and was shocked to see that the face value  for each  was  23 50    9 in admin fees and  6 for parking  clearly momentum sells for more than the face value  i expected that  but really    i am so heartbroken by this  it has been raining all weekend  i was hoping to sell my lawn tickets and get some in the covered part of the venue  but b  c of the ridiculous price i paid for them it will be a lose lose situation  this company is a total rip off 
 8 000 for a dog     and there was no customer service whatsoever we tried asking questions about the dogs while 8  eight      sales associates just stood there ignoring us   i will never return to this store
ive ordered takeout from them several times and its always delicious  we always get white pizza and its so so so good here  im not usually into white pizza but what they make is spectacular  im not into their garlic knots though   to be honest  it just seemed like bread to me  delivery is prompt   good 
this review is long overdue    my husband and i moved to toronto recently and needed to move our stuff from storage to our condo  we got it touch with you move me  and they were amazing   they loaded the things from the storage to the truck in less than 15 mins and didnt waste a minute  they were extremely careful with the furniture and very helpful with moving things around the house   we were helped by vance and kevin not sure about the second persons name   sorry   but they called themselves the a team and boy were they right  they were absolutely fantastic and worth every penny    when you book they ask if you would like them to bring you coffee  i thought this was a great touch  they gave me a potted plant though as a house warming present too     would definitely recommend    thanks to the a  team for making our final move a pleasant one   
absolutely the best cocktails ive had in toronto so far   the decor is very 1920s and cosy  the place is small so we did have to wait but it was worth it  the bartender is amazing  we did not feel rushed at all the drinks taste great and even look gorgeous    a must try 
tried this place with the husband since we were craving south indian food    we had the following  meen polichathu  the masala was great but the fish used was not pomfret  but still tasted great   appam  soft but not sweet enough  beef syrian  good masala but the beef was over cooked  malabar mutton stew  poorly seasoned  will not be trying that again  malabari roti  good but not the same as the original  this one is a little crispy and not soft   over all the ambience is ok  the service is good and if you are craving malabar cuisine and dont want to go all the way to brampton or mississauga  this will do 
so this was a disappointment  mind you the food wasnt bad nor was the service but having read the reviews i was expecting amazing food that would make me want to keep coming back  unfortunately it wasnt  the food was okay  like most diner food   good quantity and good service  they dont take reservations so you stand in line waiting to get in  you also dont have to option to put you name down  so if you are thinking of doing that and walking around the neighbourhood   think again     brown girls says   dont except to have your mind blown away  
i dont know why this place has so many great reviews  the food is okay but nothing great  its not the best ive had and not close to the indian hakka style    ambience was so so and not worth the long drive   brown girl says     _  hmm
since im on here yelping  i should give red velvet a shout out   i found them in a veg directory and my husband and i are long time regulars   weve been coming here as long as i can remember  we moved here in 2009    the chopped salad is the best   this is the only place ill buy take home deserts and cookies 
been going to this restaurant for 7 years  it has had its ups and downs  last couple of years though it has really pulled it together  consistent quality of organic food and really tasty  the pulled burdock is really amazing  great atmosphere to enjoy and family based  jennifer has put her energy in all the right places  definitely one of my most favorite restaurants in toronto   good organic smoothies and elixers
i have rented from this location a few times  each time has been friendly and pleasant   i appreciate the smiles and friendliness early in the morning  i tend to pick up the vehicle at the earliest available time    the pick up  return has been quick and trouble free   thank you 
i did not stay at the hotel and i did not go up the tower  the tower looks cool  and they have some crazy rides at the top  but its in a ghetto part of town and the people around the facility and i n it were very unappealing so i just left  no doubt this would be a great place to view the city  especially at night  but i didnt enjoy walking thru the good  the strip is bad enough
i came to eastside from minnesota to look at a bike that tj and pam were helping sell for an older customer of theirs and was thrilled to find this jewel of the moto world  in addition to being really great people  these folks know what they are doing  one look at their shop and it is easy to see the quality of their work  i ended up purchasing the bike a 79 triumph bonneville 750 special  eastside was responsible for an entire engine rebuild on the bike and after having ridden it i can say it runs as good and probably better than when it was new  i let my brother in minnesota know what i found and now we have 2 bonnevilles being shipped our way  i only wish they were a lot closer  i found them to be courteous  knowledgeable  and the workmanship of the highest quality     if you have any interest in 1970s kawasakis  i highly recommend a visit to this shop  you will not be disappointed 
had warranty repair from chas roberts through fulton homes   on a side note fulton homes quality is a joke   chas roberts is no different  just as low quality as fulton homes   came out to fix something 4 times and its still not fixed right   low quality work done by inexperienced tradesman 
food is really good  i enjoy getting guac  which they make table side to order   taquitos are good  tacos are bomb  and so are some other things    but i was too drunk to remember   recommend  yea  return  yea 
where do i even start    lets be real  cafe boulud is one of the top 20 restaurants of canada for a reason  a modern french bistro located in the four seasons hotel in yorkville that serves spectacular french food  thats it    i thought just how good can this place be  why the rave    we visited this restaurant about a month and a half ago after just returning from europe  after having tasted some of the best foods over there  i was not expecting too much from cafe boulud  but boy was i wrong    so wrong  we had the steak frites  quenelle de brochet  and the cauliflower  i am still thinking about that cauliflower to date   cauliflower will never be the same again  the steak and frites was exceptional   juicy and tender medium rare steak with duckfa fries  quenelle de brochet in lobster sauce tasted like nothing ive had before   simply  finger licking good  i was blown away by the first experience    fortunately  i had the pleasure to revisit the restaurant for lunch recently  we had the escargot puff pastry  beef cheeks and the white truffle pork sausage  the escargot puff pastry was alright  not their best  but  please allow me to rave a little about their white truffle pork sausage  it was not what was expected at all  the sausage was light  fluffy  creamy  and airy in consistency  not dense yet flavourful and aromatic  the whole dish took me by surprise  and left me wanting more    cafe boulud will remain as one of my personal bias in toronto until i can find a place to top it  it is simply delicious  please keep up the great food  and i will be back 
we always stay in summer in this hotel  totally recommended  my kids love the beach  lazy river and all the different pools available  great for families  
came here for sunday brunch  easy parking  clean restaurant  great menu with healthy and  happy  options  i got the  if you like  smoothie from the juice side  cost  9 69 with tax but its delicious  the food serving sizes are gigantic  great  kind service  tony and kate were very helpful and informative    fun ambiance for a casual brunch with healthy options  highly recommend 
went out looking for good pad thai for lunch and found it here  its a small place  but it was perfect  the woman who was working the front was attentive and polite  food was done quickly  and lunch was reasonably priced   two lunches  main dish  salad  and an egg roll  and a drink for under  20  everything was fresh and delicious  and the spice level was perfect  will definitely be back again 
thanks to all the prior reviews for helping me find this gem   never would have thought such a flavorful clean oriental restaurant would be residing so close to home   this what i have waited years for   good fresh take out   added plus is the prices are great and variety amazing     the curry chicken was the best ive found since it wasnt just 3 ingredients like most  chicken  onions and potatoes    it had water chestnuts  bamboo shoots  carrots  mushrooms  green peppers  onions and plenty of super thin sliced chicken breast   the chicken teriyaki  which i requested the sauce on the side for my daughter  was amazing   it was probably two chicken breast lightly battered and fried served over steamed cabbage  carrots and broccoli with white rice   a super delicious healthy meal for a 7 year old   my husband really enjoyed the kung pao broccoli   it had a lot of chili peppers  peanuts and a ton of broccoli   the  1 to make a combo  egg roll  crab rangoons and soup  is great deal since i plan to eat my soup and leftover curry for lunch tomorrow   cant wait to try more dishes 
im not a burger lover and i have not tried one here   however  i love the tri tip sandwich with grilled onions and no sauce   i had it 3 times and enjoyed it   this last time i got a lot of gristle so i had to take the meat out to eat around it    my husband was picking up lunch for me and after the gristle issue wasnt in the mood so i got the cesar salad with tri tip added   wow  i really liked it and the meat was plentiful and tender   a few cents more than the sandwich but worth it   we love to order online   easy to customize the order and then stop in and pick it up   otherwise parking can be a nightmare 
awesome ny style pizzas  friendly service  we were craving great pizza after the tough mudder and man did it hit the spot  and oh my the bacon cheese sticks and the to die for ranch dipping sauce are a must 
the food was so tasty  the staff was so friendly  and the food was not expensive  the environment was so welcoming and i will definitely be back  i shared the veg platter for two and it was filling and satisfying 
my college roommate and i were having a reunion weekend for the thanksgiving holiday  no better way to catch up than with a few drinks and some great food for dinner  he told me this place has great burgers  and it sounded perfect  we came on a wednesday  it was bingo night   looks fun  ill play next time for sure   immediately found a seat at the bar   which was perfect  the two bartenders were attentive  funny  and took great care of us   the menu is diverse and interesting  i got the burger with quest dip  tortilla chips  and guacamole  it was really delicious and fun to try something wild and delicious at the same time  i highly recommend this place for friends  families  anyone looking for a casual  good time at reasonable prices  its excellent     their manager sal checked in our meal and was friendly to the regulars sitting near us  we also witnessed sal handling a situation involving a patron who had been served a little too much  sal was extremely professional and handled the situation in the absolute best way possible 
i always want to support local enterprises  but i was not impressed with the rail  its early days yet so things could change  granted  i dont eat ground meat so was excited to try the veggie burger which was chickpea based  and i love all things chickpea   even with blue cheese and carmelized onions on it  it was bland  bland  bland   the bun was like wonder bread only 4x thicker   not acceptable   house made potato chips not flavorful   tried one of the much ballyhooed milkshakes  which was very good  i had strawberry    i will go again in case this wasnt a good day for them   i liked the ambience and when something starts up in akron  i tend to root for its success  however  as someone who wants her food to be mmmm good  this was as close to flavorless as food gets 
fairly good food overall  live scallops   good toro   delicious fatty tuna chilean sea bass   very good grilled salmon   pretty good grilled scallop   delicious grilled lobster   delicious strip steak   delicious
tasted fresh  i ordered the ahi poke  service was good and the fish tasted fresh  little heavy on the soy  not too much diversity in the rolls  menu in japanese  english to cater to both cultures 
some bad apples spoiled the orchard  we bought a laptop and part exchanged our old computer  nothing worked as it should  we returned the laptop soon after purchase  though the return arrangement was far from financially satisfactory we were glad to be rid of the piece of cr p they sold  they clearly do not care about customer service or repeat custom and would rather the short term gain of keeping your money  caveat emptor  pay more and go somewhere reputable where your custom is valued 
this place was such a nice way to kick off the day at the wynn   perfect service and great ambiance   our server was really nice and not snobby to us at all even though we each only ordered a salad and water   we wanted a fresh start to our day   my friend and i had the best salad in a long time   it had the best mushrooms i ever had in my life   im not kidding  we sat inside but we could tell there was a good view of the hotel pool below   when we go back to vegas we are for sure hitting this place up again before we head down to the slots for free drinks   
outstanding selection of beer  which is great for me  all the crafts you could want  coming from chicago  i was pumped to see so many great wisconsin only beers that i cant get in illinois  i also appreciate the make your own six pack deal and that you can buy single 12 ounce bottles  not a lot of stores allow this   would go here all the time for my beer needs if i lived in madison  will go back when im visiting again 
ive eaten here several times and always try something new  everything is delicious  this time i had the smoked duck wrap  it was amazing  the homemade chips are delicious as a side  there is no bad choice on the menu    service is always good  one end is a bar so you can have a drink while waiting in a table although ive never had to wait  great entrees and peanut butter pie for dessert 
fabulous wine  food and service  superb attention to detail and a true dining experience 
im a fan  im a huge fan    i arrived at this small  cozy restaurant for a private bday dinner last night  i was completely blown away by our 9 course  3 hr long meal  there were so many amazing delights throughout our meal    from the perfectly pickled beets  and thinly shaved flowers of amazing cheese in the charcuterie plate to beef cheeks so soft it makes you want to cry  and    ohhhh the perfect crunch when you bite into the pork belly  the main pieces were amazing  but little shmiddys knew how to up the experience even more  by throwing in these perfect little surprises and flavorful delights on the side  they know how to cook their veggies and dessert just as well as their meat   i can go on and on  but i wouldnt want to spoil all the fun    the owners and waitress were all extremely friendly and wonderful  making the night an even more memorable one  hands down one of my favorite dining experiences in this city  check it out  
serviced my evo 9 here again  my battery and brake light was on  i needed a new alternator  joe and team excel got me in and done the same day   best shop to service your vehicle  highly recommended 
so we just had  joseph just try to explain to us why we are double charged a resort fee that is clearly stated on united com that it was already included in our total  upon arrival our room had drugs left in the suite and they moved us  the second  upgrade  had  sanitary items and old candy behind the rooms door  after they came 3 times over 4 hours they finally noticed it and cleaned it  later on when we had guests over they noticed red dried stains on the couch that not only one cleaner but two had to come in to remove  mortified that this 5 star hotel would send us from a drug den to a filthy room   upon checkout a added  28 times 7 were added for phone usage and gym      that it clearly said we were not being charged from our original booking  the original booking said    all resort fees included in total  as a consumer  i dont think that could be more misleading  we finally had someone after over a week credit us for the charge but they made little effort to right the situation  well be staying at a true 5 star on our next visit 
i have stayed at a lot of places in lv but this was my first stay at the mandalay bay  i will be back   maybe it was because the room was huge  or the fact that there were two sinks in the bathroom  the deep bathtub  which my nieces loved   or the super hot water in the shower  it was perfect for a night away from home   the hotel was so clean and nice  it didnt smell like smoke either  like most lv hotels do   i also left lv with cash in my pocket  came out ahead  so that helps too  i am a bit sad that their room prices are so high next month because of spring break  because i really wanted to go back soon  my room for the night with taxes  fees and their resort fee was a total of  120  which i thought was really great   i was able to play the tables for a long time  the beer service was a bit slow  but thats ok  also  there werent a bunch of creepy guys trying to hit on me either so that was good   cost a ton of     to take out cash   4 6 per transaction  so be prepared when you get there   food was ok  i ate at the sushi place  didnt venture out to many of the super nice places  but i will do that next time 
i am very picky who i go to for any kind of health care  this doc came with a high recommendation from a friend   i was impressed with his knowledge and ability to listen to my concerns and respect i take an active roll in my healthcare   i will definitely recommend 
fantastic school   i signed up for a year and stayed two and just keep going  back  this school has wonderful teachers  fabulous classes and a great place to meet amazing new people  they also have a wonderful clinic to get massages for a reasonable price   my favorite classes were polarity and cranial unwinding   i would recommend this school very highly 
the franktuary truck is parked next to the  gateway two building for the art festival  the young lady at the truck was beyond friendly and nice as she handled the orders  my two standard hotdogs were perfect  try the hot sauce  it was just right  if you see this truck parked make a special effort  you wont regret it  if you are a hotdog lover check them  
fast service  bi lingual  and blanca took the time to explain a lot of details to me that have been skipped over in the past  so excited for my new phone and apple watch 
the place is quite busy today  patients waiting are impatient  grumpy and hungry  as many are fasting   im watching the three front desk people handle each person with patience and respect  as one woman complained about the long wait  and that she was hungry  the male at the front desk suggested she drink water  as that will help  other patients complained about the wait  and the ladies at the desk empathetically replied  we are doing the best we can   they really are doing the best they can  personally  im thankful that they are open on a saturday and maintain kindness and professionalism despite the fact that many patients arent giving the same respect 
i have had dish for 11 years  this past year  i have received a monthly harassing call  about paying my bill  the bill has been paid  i have spoken to 5 representatives at this point  i have to be on the do not call list  but  guess what  i still get calls about paying my bill  that has already been paid  i do not know what to do next  other than cancel my service 
super disappointed  maybe im biased bc my brother owns novacento  a pizza joint in las vegas w a real wood fired oven and this is a gas one the difference is monumental  kind of like a real fireplace and a gas one  wood one gets really hot  and has a great aroma  gas one doesnt put out heat and is merely for show  same thing w pizza fires oven  i presume my pizza came out of the oven luke warm w the mozz barely melted instead of bubbling and the entire pizza flimsy including the crust bc the gas oven cant properly heat it  the dough was another disappointment this takes  thin crust  to another level as it almost see thru thin which i would think would be easier to heat and create proper texture but the gas grill cant do it in 180 seconds atleast  very skimpy on the sauce as well maybe on purpose bc the dough cant hold up to it idk  its a great sauce tho best part of the pizza  i had the buy 1 get 1 so i had 2 diff pizzas but identical results  they would be better served w a conventional oven and cooking time  its gimmicky and will not be back
this place is the worst  i bought an ultimate car wash and it didnt even clean my car very well  i went in to let them know and the manager said  thats as good as its going to get  its touch free  it wont get everything off  i told him it didnt clean my car at all  he told me not to come back   all i wanted to do is let them know their car wash wasnt working and now im banned  wish i could give the  negative stars 
ive been there twice now  both times were very disappointing   the last time i went i said i wanted all one length and long bangs  i left with lots of choppy layers and bang so short and arched     i cant believe how disappointing the place is  i wasnt even able to pin my bangs back because they were so short   i would say third time is the charm but i wont being going back to find out  would have better luck at the aveda school 
save ur money    go to chipotle    wasnt verry appealing at all so i gave it a try   not the best burrito but hey the people that work inside is friendly  
sadly this place is closed  go to taco bell instead  the pepsi taste better there  the ice isnt even cold ice here  i got diarrhea for days
the best croissants in town and the only bakery to get kouign amann    what is a kouign amann you ask  its a croissant raised to the doughnut power   sweet  buttery  flaky perfection in every single bite  cant wait to go back 
walked in with a smashed screen and battery that didnt last longer than 45 minutes  fixed my sceeen and my battery in less than an hour and great customer service 
my wife and i just ate dinner here and i was pleasantly suprised  the dining area is nothing special but its in a strip mall so we werent expecting much  a few cafeteria type tables bit the place was clean  my wife had the chile rellano and i had the enchiladas   plates   hers was good but a little bland  mine was fantastic  i ordered the beef and the tortilla was good as well as being stuffed with peppers and onions  we paid  16 for both so the price was excellent  i would have given it 5 stars except the bland rellano  we will be back  nice and cheap 
so i have been here twice  the first time i had the green chile burrito and my wife had the taco salad  the burrito was amazing  the flavor was so good and my wife loved the taco salad  the second time my wife had the taco salad again and loved it but i had the beef enchiladas plate   the flavor was excellent but i think they had it already prepared in the oven and the bottom was burnt  still good with the burnt flavor but i would have preferred it not to be burnt on the bottom 
what a baseball park  location is easy to find  parking is off the hook   after a game the area is jumping   baseball park was cool  felt like i was on top of the atmosphere   every seat in the house is good   you can see the action from everywhere even outside   nice place
1st time coming here for me yesterday with hubby   he had been before though on previous trip   for drinks we had thai teas  those were creamy   delicious  not overly sweet    for an appetizer we got the bachi pickles  which is 6 different veggies that have been pickled   all of those were really good   for our burgers   hubby got the ronin burger   i got the no meat here  burger    it was the best veggie burger i have ever had   told my family about this that is coming to vegas today   we will definitely be back 
fish was pretty good  fries were soggy  not sure if that is the  english  style  one of  my kids didnt like the chicken and fries on the kids meal  the other one liked the fish  not the chips  it was also hot in the restaurant  no a  c on  cool atmosphere though  server was friendly 
capriottis is definitely my favorite sandwich shop in town  the sandwiches are always fresh  and i feel you get a pretty decent deal for your money  my favorites are the bobbi and the capastrami  occasionally  youll get an offer to do their online survey  as a reward  ive gotten a few bucks off my next sandwich  and even a free small sub  definitely a must try if you havent been here before
who wants some really tasty pizza  this is the spot  i love going here because its easy to get to in the middle of the city  the service is pretty good but this restaurant is always busy and it can get very loud  try the pizza and get a quick drink while youre there 
this is the place to go to for the huge events like the fit expo  the car show and many more  make sure to attend an event that interests you  the building is huge so try not to get lost and make sure you walk all around it to get a feel of it 
if youre looking a nice place to eat during your shopping adventure  then you found the spot  the food is quick  tasty and well priced  also a good place to grab a couple of drinks with some friends in the summer time 
delish  the place is upscale for a fast casual restaurant  the ramen was done perfectly   excellent value and a perfect downtown quick bite 
so far best buffet at the strip  i took me about two hours to get in on a thursday night but it was all worth it  they have really great food and it all has authentic taste  starting from the mexican to the asian  they have mediterranean food as well  they have great choice of meat on the grill like a brazilian steak house would fresh  flavorful and juicy  there dessert area is full of over 15 different cupcakes which my favorite was the rum with vanilla cheesecake custard fill   you can also find cheesecake  bread pudding  and ice cream   if you are looking for seafood this also a great place to go too they serve hot and cold crab legs and you can find shrimp scampi as well as a assortment of shrimp  next time you are by the miracle mile shops or just hanging out at planet hollywood make sure to drop by to fill up a big appetite of goodness 
as anyone can tell by my previous reviews i love mexican food so i  had to check this spot out  the chips and salsa werent bad the chips were warm and the salsa was decent  i ordered the vegetarian quesadilla which wasnt mind blowing but wasnt terrible  now if you want a great drink try the mango tango that was pretty tasty  i would just say this is your average americanized tex mex place not particularly good not particularly bad just average f 
recently moved to the lakewood  cleveland area from columbus  a co worker referred me to barrio  everything ive ever had here is so tasty  i am a sucker for blood orange and their blood orange margaritas are top notch  the variety of tacos are unreal  chips  salsa  guac oh my   all so good  finally  recently had friends from columbus up here visiting  decided to do a late lunch here on a saturday afternoon  all 3 ladies said they wished there was a taco place like this in columbus 
follow up review  recieved an email back and have been in contact with them since  guess you could say i spoke negatively to soon 
quick stop after reds game to let the traffic thin out   all 4 of us had good beer from tap  and then added a taco to hold us over  as it was taco tuesday   they were perfect   and vince was fantastic to all    its a bar atmosphere  pool table    plenty of tvs   but very welcoming  
my husband and i were i search of a wine and cheese date night  we decided bar bianco since we have never been here  the location is in central phoenix in an old house which is awesome  the ambience is dim light  hipster  and romantic  the wine selection isnt very broad but there is a little bit of everything  bar bianco is local so has az wines and local food  we ordered an antipasto dish and the goat cheese crostini  both delicious  the antipasto had delicious grilled veggies  cheese  and salami  great flavor   our server was very friendly and knowledgeable  she checked on us multiple times  we will be back in the future 
today  i visited cafe rio for a quick tortilla soup and left with the following   1 tortilla soup  yay   1 long  dark hair in the foil wrapped tortilla that accompanied said tortilla soup  boo   20 minutes of my life gone waiting in the worlds slowest line behind maybe 8 people 7 splatters of bleach on my custom tailored vince sheath dress 0 stamps for my now defunct stamp card  because i wont download their app  in case youre wondering  75 is the number of tortilla soups i would need to eliminate from my diet to pay to replace the ruined dress  which is definitely more than ive eaten in my life  so im pretty much never going back 
even the chinese buffet in chadron  nebraska was better than this  dont even be tempted 
exceptional evening at this unassuming spot way off the strip   in the private room our group  enjoyed the white pizza  caesar salad  veal marsala  carbonara  chicken parm and cannelloni   service was spot one  not too intrusive  well timed and friendly without being obsequious   traditional italian dine extremely well 
it is expensive amd worth every penny  i spent a relaxing two hours in the jacuzzis  on the hot stone loungers and in the sauna and steam rooms before an 80 minute facial with karen   what a perfect way to unwind in a gorgeous setting 
best steakhouse ever   the decor and ambiance of the restaurant could be spruced up a bit but the steak more than makes up for the negatives   i ordered the rib eye and that first bite was just orgasmic     the steak was perfectly seasoned with such an amazing flavor that just melted in my mouth   im salivating just thinking about it   my friend ordered the new york and that was just as good   definitely a place to visit while in vegas   ask for some horseradish on the side as well   they were the strongest horseradish ive ever had in my life but so so good 
i dont understand why this place is getting these great reviews   the burger i had  the black jack  was extremely bland and tasteless   i dont think they seasoned the meat   my 2 other companions felt the same way   did the kitchen run out of salt and pepper that day    im not sure but i dont think ill be coming back   im only giving this place two stars because of good service and their beer selection 
bomb chicken fingers     great service     great taste       great place  the food taste fresh  keep it up 
smelled good  looked good  lost appetite when the young lady that was making my philly answered the phone with her gloves on  took peoples credit cards  used cash register  scratched her face all with the same pair of gloves and then thought it was ok to handle the food 
i had a dental emergency and called the office thursday  trying to find out if they can see me as soon as possible to my amazement they could see me as soon as this afternoon  you cant do better than that  when i arrived at the office in the a m  i was promptly taken into the examination room  x rays of the tooth that bothered me were taken as well as the pantographic  full mouth  x rays   10 minutes later i was seen by dr  arian   he was very knowledgable  laid back and did not skimp on time talking to me about my condition and available treatment options  i really appreciated him being very friendly  communicative and explaining everything to me  i also appreciated the fact that he took his time and did not rush me or try to talk me into any expensive procedure  he totally put me at ease and i liked that a lot  his dental assistant who was helping me  unfortunately i dont remember her name  was super friendly and knew what she was doing  the front desk staff was also very nice and accommodating   i will certainly see them again  cos they offered me the sort of care i was hoping for 
good prices  good food  shrimp tempura here is bomb  definitely coming back here a lot more  
no frills classic hamburger joint for over inflated prices    definitely nothing wrong with the burgers or fries from five guys  burgers have an old school feel but you can get better burgers and fries in the city for a fraction of the price  id rather go to burgers priest or big smoke myself   love that they have free shelled peanuts to eat while you wait  and the food is good  but over 14 dollars for a fast food burger and fries  and no drink isnt great value    also the cheese on the burgers werent fully melted  they have all the classic burger toppings you need but nothing interesting  also they gave us tons of fries  probably too many  there was like a second helping of fries in the bag  bag fries  also the cajun style fries arent all that spectacular     definitely worth a try if youve never been before  but not on my list of places id have to return 
as far as sushi restaurants go  and fusion restaurants go  this place hits the mark on both fronts   food is well presented  and put together very well  not only does it look great  but it tastes great too  on top of the quality of the food  they have a unique menu with some items i havent seen at other sushi restaurants  and its also a plus that they are delicious  put all these things together for reasonable prices  and you have a winner   the pressed sushi is a definite try  never had sushi pressed into blocks like that before  but it was delicious  it made the sushi more cohesive  and makes it next to impossible for the fish to fall off the rice  i preferred the pressed salmon over the tuna because the salmon had a crispy textural element  while the tuna overall was mostly soft   a lot of the rolls here look fancy  and also pack a lot of ingredients  i tried the island roll to start  and i have to say it was pretty delicious  it had tempura shrimp  yam  avocado  and bbq scallop  there was also the same delicious sauce on top that was on the pressed sushi  this roll comes hot though  so if you dont like the idea of hot sushi move on  but i loved it   i also tried some of the udon soup  and it was very clean and refreshing  the veggies  cabbage in it had a nice bite to it  and still had some integrity   i would totally return to this restaurant  to be honest  it reminded me of when i went to vancouver and sushi here was ruined for me because i couldnt get wild salmon anymore  now that this place makes such tasty well put together rolls  its going to ruin all the other sushi restaurants for me 
solid indian food at reasonable prices  and bonus free parking   after years i wanting to check out banjara  i finally did a couple weekends ago  they have free parking in the front along bloor  a rarity in toronto for sure   it might be hard to get a spot during dinner time  but we luckily nabbed one of the last spots  in the restaurant we sat in the space in the front  which has a lot of natural light  and you are close enough to the other tables to spy on what they are eating   based on reviews i had read  and just what i like to eat  we ordered four of the different curries  the chicken tikka  the mushroom curry  the palak paneer  and the malai kofta  my favourite of the four was the chicken masala  and not only because it was the only meat dish  but was just the yummiest  the sauce of the malai kofta was pretty great though  i would recommend trying all four though   we ate all of the food in front of us  and there was no leftovers  i will probably be back  and next time i might do take out and try a few different curries 
canoe is pretty much everything i expected it to be  yummy food  good service  great view and a perfect place to go on a special occasion or to treat yourself to something nice  if you can go at lunch time the prices are a bit cheaper  and the menu is also completely different  the only downside is that they are usually only open monday friday   if you are worried about canoe being a place with small over priced portions and youll walk away feeling hungry do not despair  as this is a place where the bread keeps coming  i think our table of 2 went through 4 baskets of complimentary bread with black bean spread  the artisanal bread was fabulous  crunchy on the outside  and soft in the middle   my girlfriend and i both had the beef short ribs with whipped potatoes  sauteed kale  sugar beets  and pickled sour cream  the beef was very tender and falling off the bone  the flavours were wonderful  the dish seemed to have little yellow beets on top of the short rib  with a couple large red ones on the side  my only complaint is i could have used more whipped potatoes  but then the dish wouldnt have looked as nice  in the end  i have no regrets ordering the short rib   for dessert we both had the red velvet cake  with sweetened cream cheese  smoked marshmallow ice cream  and salted chocolate ganache  the smoked marshmallow ice cream is definitely what caught my eye and made me order it  but the element that brings it all together is the salted chocolate ganache  it makes sure everything isnt just sweet on sweet  and overall the dessert wasnt too sweet to begin with  it was also a very pretty plate  and a decent sized serving for a dessert at a  fancy restaurant   the dessert was definitely worth ordering   if you are coming from out of town  and want to save a few bucks on the cn tower  the view from canoe is just as good  and they have a bar area you can sit at and grab a drink or something to eat while youre there 
i was pleasantly surprised by this place  i wasnt expecting much of this place  just another crappy asian food place  i was surprised when i found out that it wasnt just asian style noodle dishes  but all different kinds   you pay up front  and the food is brought out to you  i had the spicy beef  it was really good  and the portion are quite healthy considered how fair the prices are 
rip pool party season 2013  encore beach club is a gorgeous venue  gorgeous people  beautiful fake palm trees  bright orange day beds  and awesome djs    the biggest downfall is the staff  they are rude  condescending  and do not understand the definition of  hospitality    sadly  they know people will come regardless due to the popularity of the venue and find reasons to be jerks    note to encore beach club management  if the pool is slow on a friday  please take the sticks out of your asses and allow reentry 
ive heard raving reviews about the old fashioned prior to my trip to madison and i was looking forward to our meal when we arrived early and still had to wait for a table  my expectations for this place were high and i was disappointed in the food and service   our server was not friendly and when we paid with cash  she shortchanged us  unbelievable   additionally  the cheese curds were soggy from being completely soaked in oil and the fish and chips were over battered with more batter than fish  they do have a good variety of beers  so i would stick to the old fashioned for drinks only  in which case  dont wait for a table 
mmmmmmmmm  love me some local vegas pizza  their calzones are great and i love the meat sauce with bread  this all depends on personal preference but any pizza with light sauce is delish 
i wasnt a total fan of carson kitchen the first time i came here  but ive somehow returned numerous times and now consider myself a regular  im actually quite a fan now    carson kitchen has a really sweet and genuine staff with great knowledge of the menu  how its prepared  the ingredients that go into it  etc   the food is strangely unique and everything is super tasty  i feel like the menu changes semi frequently  so ill refrain from commenting on each individual dish   my complaints    1  the setup   come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens  all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle  come in on a summer day and when the door opens  your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat  2  their prices   carson kitchen costs more than some places on the strip  for me  thats whats holding them back from giving them five stars 
large portions  great quality  lots of options  henderson location is awesome  the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome   i would say that pinkaows traditional thai dishes are comparable to lotus of siams and that they are simply just less busy 
my favorite starbucks in charlotte    this location was the closest to my former workplace  so i was a frequent customer  i loved the cozy feeling of being in an old former house    its cozy but its spacious  which i love since i usually come to starbucks to work or read and stay awhile  theres ample seating  although during busy weekday hours  you might have to wait for a seat    came by today for the first time since march  and the newly renovated space totally blew me and my interior design loving self away  its still got that cozy house feel but now its also got that modern chic vibe going on with hardwood wall panels  neat lighting fixtures  black brick  etc    still my favorite charlotte starbucks  now its just more elevated and prettier 
amazing staff    ive been bringing my pups there since one was literally a puppy and the other was 2  they have always had a good experience and the staff is super sweet   more recently i had a scare with my boxer and i had work that day  in a panic i called and asked if there was any way they could see him asap  little did i know  they have a drop off option so i was able to come get him after work  just made it really convenient and i wasnt worried all day at work  i just didnt want him alone and think that something could happen to him     they take great care of my babies   
went there last night  the food was overpriced and bland  the food took forever to be brought out and it was cold  the server brought fajitas without tortillas  who does that  chilis has better fajitas than this place  it has a good location and thats how they stay in business  avoid this place 
to the assjob that just answered the phone and intentionally  condescendingly instructed me that they  werent a bar  after i simply asked if they had any tvs to watch the games and wine offered yet   ill be hard pressed to somehow get past that call to ever find my way into your  non bar   in fact  ill be sure to spread the word about what you are  not  and more importantly  what you are   you just lost a lot of local business  pal 
ive been a lexus driver for years and years  absolutely am still thrilled about the vehicle itself   and as far as the service  cant complain a bit when talking about the hendrick lexus independence location  they treat you like gold    however  the northlake location is absolutely brutal  nobody knows what theyre doing and theyre extremely rude  if youre buying a car  then theyll tend to you    but as soon as it comes to the servicing side of things  forget it  this location only cares about the money and not a bit about the services that hendrick and lexus strive to ordinarily provide  save your frustrations and travel the extra distance to the south charlotte location off of independence to get what you truly deserve  the northlake location is a joke 
very good food   very good selections    very nicely displayed   but   pricey       35   is a lot of money   it includes beer   wine   big deal   i was super tired   super hungry  so i went   i did really enjoy everything i had   i guess things have just gotten more expensive 
i had a good time    last year     and going back for more this year   its nice to have a place where men can go to be together with each other in a safe and pleasant environment    and by the way  just across the parking lot is one of the best little thai restaurants ever    i would be a bit cautious of that part of town at night time  although i have walked and taken the city bus   just saying  
after reading the reviews of yelp  i decided to try this place  not bad  just some things i wanted to point out    1  the menus posted outside the restaurant is old  gangnam package shows calamari  they now replaced the sit down menus with corn  ive posted the new menu   2  i got my miso soup and salad before my drinks  when i asked the waiter  he said he didnt work my table    3  the waiter who said he didnt work my table  was quick to take my money and ring me up after i was done eating 
so excited to finally be reviewing this place  after a lot of recommendations from friends and amazing reviews on yelp  my brother and i decided to step outside of our usual seafood comfort zone and try some new orleans style crab  shrimps and mussels  we definitely werent disappointed  the food was delicious and it paired well with the awesome customer service we had from dawn   shes amazing  if you can ask for her table   we were recommended the trifecta sauce  2 hot level  we probably could of handled level 3  but wanted to keep it safe  ordered the snow crabs  shrimps and mussels   all so delicious and spicy  ended up ordering another bag of crabs and shrimps to go for our parents     word of caution  did ended up getting sick afterwards that night and next day    i dont know if this happened to others that night 2  16  16
do not go here  very disgusting how they treat your pets  please  please find a place that will actually take care of your fur babies 
what an awesome and historic building and block   super nice guys who hosted this spring reunion   plenty near by  even had time to walk to a cocktail before dinner as its only a couple of blocks from state st   went to the pub   nice work to this valley who so graciously hosted milwaukee as well  looking forward to the next one   thank you 
10 14 16  i ordered a calzone   was extremely disappointed in the order  portion was small   taste was very bland  dont order the calzone until they fix the issue  after expressing our concern with the calzone to the waitress the manager rob never came over to talk to us 
my friend and i were here on a saturday night  we made reservation at 7 in advance  when we arrived  the restaurant was pretty slow  about 4 tables including us  honestly  i was expecting a traditional japanese look of the restaurant  but the restaurants interior was not  it was more like a american restaurant look           anyhow  we ordered a bunch of sushi  and a specialty sashimi plate server recommended  and a wagyu beef plate  the fish quality was really good  but the sauce they put on some of the sushi i didnt enjoy that much  especially the sauce they put on uni and snapper  other than the sauce  they all tasted pretty good  because the fish quality was fresh    the wagyu beef was the best  it was really fresh  and the salmon specialty sashimi plate was good  too   it was one of the popular dish           service was okay   we ordered like 8 different sushi  but every sushi plate came separately  and it took about 5 15 minutes for every another plate to come     and because we were hungry  we later added the wagyu beef plate  and it took about 20 mins   it really took forever   seriously    there was only 2 tables including us    3 sushi chefs and 2 servers   servers were nice  but it was a little bit difficult to get their attention when we needed  and last  i hate to say this  but i saw one of the servers nail seemed really dirty  it was black    i dont think it is appropriate for servers  because it made me lost a bit of appetite at first              overall  if the food can come out faster it would be a lot better 
i love montys and come here every time i come into madison   as a vegan it offers a large amount of vegan choices and its so tasty   staff is friendly  atmosphere is great   everything ive ever had off the vegan menu is amazing   
when the vig opened  we all thought wed died and gone to heaven  someplace this cool  and we dont have to drive for a half hour to get there   oh man  bocce in the back  strong drinks  they light incense to keep it smelling sweet despite the still in renewal locale  what could be bad about this   now its part of a movement  and not the shiny new penny in the bunch  but it still has a warm place in my heart    they have great happy hour  the patio with a fireplace is warm and inviting  and the interior of the bar has deep booths and sports on the tube  its not the british museum  but you just might want to plan an assignation here 
its lovely  comfortable and  like sushi in the biltmore has always been  ever so slow  our waitress was so obviously not interested in the tasks at hand that our mood was eventually affected by it too 
nice casual atmosphere  we stopped there on the way to the airport from the vegas strip for lunch and it wasnt crowded at that time  good for families or large parties  it has a great variety of game changing burgers on the menu  such creativity and really good tasting  they also have ramen and other yummy dishes  the oxtail chili fries with fried egg on top was to die for  i had the miyaki san burger  sooo good  i highly recommend it  please open one in seattle  
i have to say that i really like lucilles  i love the fried pickles and they have the best veggie burger  the mac cheese is good  but its a little heavy  the fried okra is great if youre an okra fan  they have good iced tea and pink lemonade that comes is huge mason jars so that you never run out of something to drink  the restaurant is huge and they have a large outdoor seating area 
after a rocky start    james    mgr   made it a outstanding stay     if you ever have any issues james is the man to make it right     thanks to james and his team      i will be back
i have to give this a 4 star for the breakfast burrito   i just had the amado breakfast burrito and it one of the best ive had in az   made with hash browns nice and soft to mold the bacon egg and cheese into a gushy goodness  fast  hot and great taste if breakfast burritos are your passion as they are mine dont miss this hot spot  looking forward to a revisit 
i am in cleveland frequently enough for work and to visit family and i try to sniff out the local fare i cant get at home  my sisters boyfriend recommended this place and i am glad he did  ridiculously generous portions  we got the wood plank     a meal that servers  2 4 persons  or so says the menu  more like 4 5  a veritable carpet of schnitzel and pork chops with sides  salads  and bread ensue  really  all of it was quite fantastic and reminded me a lot of grandmas home cooking and what i ran into abroad in eastern europe  not sure what all the  it was bland  is about in some reviews  schnitzel isnt exactly a complex dish and the goulash was plenty paprika spicy    the pork chops were smothered in onions  bacon  and seemingly sun dried bell peppers  also  get the summer stew  the sausage in it are like these little buttery slices of heaven  hardly bland by any standard  it is a tad pricey though    thus 4 stars 
this was horrible i ordered a whole caesar salad and barely got half  also i paid 7 06 never again 
during a recent vacation trip to las vegas  i had a great experience at the range 702  having never been shooting before  i was not quite sure what to expect but the website had many great experiences to choose from  everything from the on time hotel pickup  check in  introductions and familiarization  and the shooting experience itself were exceptional  although there were other customers using the range  i never felt rushed and they even provided the opportunity for pictures   the range officer answered all of my questions no matter how novice and made me feel very comfortable  i really enjoyed trying some guns that i wouldnt have the opportunity to use elsewhere   i highly recommend the range 702  unlike other activities and tours that can take the better part of a day  a shooting experience can be done in a couple of hours  in fact on the last day of my trip  i had some time in the morning and went back again
the interior of graze looks very nice  so my initial impression was a good one   we came during brunch  and we only waited about 10 minutes for a table   to start the meal we ordered cheese curds   they werent bad  but they definitely werent worth  9   my boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and i ordered a beer to drink   the bloody mary was mediocre   i wanted to have a burger  but the burger is served on an english muffin   i asked if i could have a bun instead   the waitress then informed me that buns would not be available for another hour when brunch was over   my boyfriend wanted a sandwich  but the honey wheat bread was not appealing to him   he was informed he could not make a substitution on the bread though   we then decided to just have the cheese curds and drinks  since the options on the menu werent appealing to us as is   we had been done with our food and drinks for 15 minutes before our waitress came by with our check  and we actually had to stop her when she was walking past to get the check   the people next to us didnt get their check until right after we got ours  and they had been done eating before we even got our cheese curds   this was a very disappointing dining experience 
this is one of my favorite great dane locations   i have been here a number of times   the service and food is consistently some of the best in madison   they also have some of the best cheese curds in the state   the beer here isnt my favorite  but they usually have at least one or two good beers on tap   the bartenders are pretty good too  so mixed drinks are always an option when the beer selection isnt at its best 
for starters  the egg rolls were amazing  probably the best egg roll ive had  tempura like shell and yummy veggies and stuff inside  main course  the korean veggie ramen was delicious  the perfect amount of spicy  presentation was beautiful  atmosphere was alright  we had an early dinner so the restaurant wasnt filling up until about when we were leaving  we realized there was a back area where you can watch the cooks  which looked fun but we had no idea it existed  would go back  but would ask to sit in back 
best pho in town  i tried pho at many different vietnamese  restaurants in charlotte and i love it here the most  the broth is as good as pho in vn  i also like c1  combination broken rice  it is so delicious  yummy 
i attended george brown chef school for three years  in two programs and although started out wondering if it was such a great idea to have chosen this school  ended up loving it  when i first started i thought it was a bit of a culinary student factory  i wondered how many of my fellow students had gotten in  but  once you get past the apathy of many of the students and you get involved  meet the teachers  it is a great place to make connections and learn a lot  the chef school was overhauled as i was studying there  and is a beautiful space with state of the art kitchens and baking studios  the cafeteria is pretty terrible  so id recommend bringing a lunch or running over to st  lawrence  overall  a great learning experience 
insomnia has been in the annex for what seems like forever  thats a good sign  our group was seated in the lounge section  with its overstuffed couches and chairs  the paintings of the wall were interesting  it seemed like the put the strangest ones in the back of the restaurant  the burning forest was perhaps a bit much  but a good conversation piece  indeed  the server was amiable and let us know the drink specials as soon as we sat down  the drink specials were good   4 creemore pints and 3  jager shots on monday night  the food was nothing special  the fries were crispy and excellent  served with an aioli  the chicken sandwich lacked much chicken and my dining partners chicken and brie sandwich was over bried  if thats possible    the lively atmosphere was perfect for having a few drinks and an appetizer  but i wouldnt eat an entire meal here again 
re review update  they have added a few tables and chairs  and continue to make delicious banana chocolate croissants  worth a star  id say 
cool looking space  friendly service   we went with a group for saturday brunch  i was surprised by how empty it was  when we checked out the menu online  i envisioned a long line up  we all ordered coffee  that was the first bad impression  the coffee tasted funny  the entire group could not pinpoint exactly what it was   we questioned if it was goat milk  if the creamer was bad  turned out the coffee was just poor tasting   weak and sour  almost goaty   i ordered the hog town benny  it was just alright and came with greens and a cold potato salad  two people at the table had to return their orders     the one order was the cheesy stuffed french toast   it was completely raw inside  when a new order came  we all tasted it and it was really good   the problem seems to be that the bread itself is very very thick   its basically a loaf of bread on your plate  then came the real alarm   chicken and waffles  the chicken was raw in the centre not just under cooked  whats worse is that they tried to tell us it was just the colour of chicken thigh meat and brought it back   which means no one in the kitchen understands the health concerns   and a customer that doesnt know about proper cooking techniques could get seriously sick   hello anyone ever heard of salmonella   i was on the fence about returning  maybe it would be a group brunch thing once in a while for kicks   but i cant go back 
this was my second time visiting central phoenix eye care  and i have to say that truly  everyone at this office is wonderful  the front office staff are sweet  efficient and take care of all insurance queries quickly  the back office staff are pleasantly conversant while taking care of all their duties in a way that is quick but thorough and dr  mastores who i saw is just an absolute peach  she is personable  intelligent and listens well  even when it came down to picking new frames and ordering new contacts  all the financials were covered prior so as to help me if i needed to budget insurance coverage  would highly recommend 
i thought this was a very good hotel and in a great location  i considered staying at the wisconsin union or hotel red  they were both a little bit more expensive and while they were closer to camp randall stadium  i thought the madison concourse being around the block from state street was a better location  the beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very clean and modern looking  they also offered free wi fi  i will definitely look to stay here again if  when i come back for another football game 
very affordable and clean  surrounded by tons of places to eat  drink or shop  the entire area looks like it was re developed 5 10 years ago  i would stay here again 
this casino is fun to wander around it  it isnt the nicest place in vegas  but it isnt the worst either  anyone who is a fan of the real new york will get a kick out of the details that are truly reminiscent of the big apple  i liked watching the rooftop roller coaster  this is also the spot to see  zumanity  which is really fun  for adults   i wont likely stay here  but i will likely stop into the casino or go on the roller coaster again 
from the moment my husband and i selected bella rose estate  bre  as our wedding venue to the execution of the wedding itself  it has been an absolute pleasure to work with the team  the grounds are beautifully kept  a perfect place for an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour  the ballroom is elegant with chandeliers  a tile floor and a wood dance floor  we purchased the all inclusive package which narrowed down our vendors  catering  florist  bakery  dj  bartenders  and helped limit the amount of research we needed to do  i would highly recommend this not only so the vendors are familiar with the venue  but also if you are new to the area like us and do not have many references  the bre team was always more than happy to answer any questions along the way  we communicated mostly via e mail and their response time was usually within 24 hours  we had one in person planning meeting where we went over the flow of the day as well as wedding details such as linens and any upgrades we were interested in with a member of the bre team  the wedding day can be stressful for the bride with lots of  moving parts   i must say that our day of wedding coordinator  gabriela  was amazing  she was confident  experienced and helped the day run seamlessly  if there was anything that didnt go as planned  i didnt know about it  she took care of the minor glitches which allowed me to enjoy my day and evening  i especially appreciated how professional and experienced the staff was  each person we came in contact with displayed a high level of expertise 
this restaurant is a master of understatement  from the outside and upon entering  it doesnt look like much   as it should be  the truth is in the food  food    best beef and broccoli ive ever had   we are regulars now   simply outstanding
really fun place   with yummy  yummy food  i ordered the beef carpaccio and loved it so much  i ordered a second  sake bomb was fun  with the whole restaurant getting in on it  but  probably not delicious on its own    would be happy to return 
i used to go to oishi sushi frequently when i lived nearby  its a very nice  cozy  somewhat upscale place with class and ambiance  low noise    dim lights make it great for dates  best red dragon rolls in town  my personal favorite  
i am a single mom of a 10 year old son and his hair grows out so fast  i hate the quality of the cheap hair cut places we all know the names of them  anyway  i wanted my son to have good hair cuts  preferably like military style  being a girl i knew nothing of barber shops really  but i went to beauty brands myself and loved it  next door was a cute little barber shop  very clean and classy looking  so i walked in with my son and even though i a got a little bit of looks for being a girl and walking in to a barber shop  where men usually expect a break from the female species  they were still completely polite and fast  usually within 0 5 min my son was in a seat getting his hair cut  they were professional  great at cutting his hair  and even started remembering us after a few visits  the 15 dollar price for a kids cut was a little more than the cheap places  but not unreasonable at all  and well worth it  each chair had a separate tv to watch and mostly they would change to cartoons for my young son  weve been going since he was about 3   the atmosphere was awesome for a  man  business  they have a pool table  and games to play while waiting  they do the whole hot towel and straight edge shave for the men  they even did the hot towel and shoulder massage for my son if he wanted  i cant say enough of how great they treated us  how great the hair cut always was  the atmosphere amazing  and price totally reasonable   honestly i would have left 5 stars  but in the past few years they hired a female to cut hair  and an older gentleman  neither of those two were as good at cutting hair  but still vs is amazing and i love them and never want to go anywhere else  i just request the guy i know is really good and our experience is always awesome  i am constantly telling people to go there 
this has been by far the worst dr experience we have ever had  i went with patient to his appt and we waited at least 45 min just to get back  dr kundavarum  possibly misspelled  was suppose to see him for 215pm appt  but was after 3 when called back  then i sat out in waiting room for 2 hours and when i finally asked how much longer   the lady said the dr wasnt going to see him until the very end because he had some difficulties with his catheter last time  what   then why not schedule him for last appt of day   i finally left to go pick up something before store closed because it was now almost 5 pm   still hasnt been seen  patient was lying naked on table this whole time  getting more and more uncomfortable by the min  finally  the dr came in 3 hours after we had gotten there  was in for 5 min switched out catheter  asked patient to do a procedure but patient had concerns  dr didnt even address them just left and patient finally came out and we left  we were not the only ones waiting forever btw  every patient there  was in that waiting room for soo soo long   only reason they deserve one star is the amazing girls who work front desk and medical assistant  they try to be kind even though their job makes it impossible to make customers happy  they literally make you bring ur insurance cards to every visit and show them  its not the end of the world but highly unnecessary  i cant believe the other reviews ive read  we are not the only ones  this place is aweful 
we were there to look at trailers had 1 sales  ranger  approach us   said she was an rv associate but walked with us for approximately 5 mins  there were no gulf carts to take us out so she pointed were to go  no one else even approached us  we have cash  we also both have an 800 credit score   needless to say were going to main to check out other  rv delears
we ate here all five nights we stayed at the resort  because at the end of an amazing day why ruin a good thing  the apple salad  the salmon  scallops  are all memorable bests  great wine to accompany  also the staff is attentive   friendly  and honest 
i love golds  it is my home away from home  i have been a member for about 3 years  the gym is always clean and the group classes are outstanding  my teens are always welcome in the classes which is a real plus for our family  the staff is always friendly and helpful    there are only 2 negatives i can think of  sometimes the desk staff are not as well informed as they should be  the parking lot can get crazy full  so be sure you give yourself time to get parking 
i love costco  it has really helped me save money when shopping for my big family  the employees give excellent customer service and they all seem so happy  even when it is busy the lines at the registers move fast  i would highly recommend costco to anyone wanting great savings and good service 
1  fesenjoon   all crap      2  hummus   the same with fesenjoon 3  kashke bademjoon   very nice     dont recommend here
i love this persian restaurant  aside from the delicious and authentic persian cuisines  the staffs are so friendly  i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking for great food 
sweet jesus have mercy   this was an amazing eating experience   best burger ive had in canada   fries were awesome too   since it was my first time i got the california and it was great   lovely grilled onion and fresh tomato   i could have done without the buttered bun as the actual meat is very juicy and greasy  in a good way  so it just wasnt necessary   wish i was in town longer  would have loved to try the priest and a milkshake   bring cash  and if you see an open footstool  er  table  snag it fast 
having grown up in a former british colony there are two things i crave    fish and chips and shepherds pie and gordon ramseys didnt disappoint   the shepherds pie which i havent been able to enjoy in a few years was a bit different from what i remember from my you th but the flavors of my childhood certainly came through and the portion size was just right   the fish was perfectly cooked    i like a bit of seasoning in my batter but the fish was perfectly executed and i enjoyed the tartar sauce that was served with it but again needed just a bit more seasoning   we tried so many things on the menu from the delicious truffle fries to the lobster and shrimp rolls and the expertly crafted drinks   the service was great   our server attentive  knowledgeable but the table set up was a bit odd   i dont like feeling like im sitting in a walkway and our table was directly towards the back of the host stand and we saw everyone that walked by  also we had some fun benches where people patiently waiting got to stare at us eat so that would be my one and only criticism of how the restaurant is laid out   mr ramsey and his reputation are definitely elevated by this particular location 
its is your typical pizza hut pizza  this location is a carry out  delivery only  the carry out deals are great  amd since this is close to home  we take advantage of those  i found that the delivery drivers havr no personality  they have forgotten to deliver things ive ordered like soda or my side of bread sticks  amd i never get my ranch or blue cheese when they deliver wings  overall  wings are good  pizza is typical   and they have good deals 
it is nice to not have to drive to south carolina to see a charlotte knights game  the bb t stadium is beautiful    there really is not a bad seat here  just grab a pair of  10 tickets and go  it makes for a great night out  parking was close  easy  and only  5    there is something for everyone at the stadium  of course everything is over priced  you are at stadium uptown  however there are some great local craft beers  bbq  nachos  chick fil a  and baseball staples like hot dogs  peanuts  and cracker jacks    we took a walk all the way around the stadium to check out each section  every spot had a great view and we loved that we could make laps around the place    i think the only negatives would be  1  center field seats cannot see the score board  2  we went on a fireworks night and the game went past 11 00pm   so no fireworks  we were a bit disappointed     all in all  this is a great venue and i am looking forward to more visits here with more knights victories 
i am always happy with the services at monte bella  ive been seeing mary for many years and have always left happy  my highlights are very natural looking  they always listen to what i want and offer tips on how to make it look that same way when i get home  i most recently had my makeup done for pictures and it came out beautifully  the staff is all so friendly and make you feel comfortable  monte bella is my go to for everything beauty 
i really like this location  ive never had to wait very long no matter what time ive showed up  the staff is so friendly   walking to our table we are greeted with  how are you    enjoy your meal  i really appreciate that  the servers are usually enthusiastic  prompt  amd professional  ive never had a problem with the food  my favorite dish here is the mezzaluna   so delicious   the chicken parm with the garlic potatoes also always hits the spot  if there is room  i love to end my meal with the chocolate dream cake   never had anything so  dreamy   and of course on the way out we are wished a good night from the staff we pass  i always have an enjoyable experience here 
i came here last weekend while waiting for a table at the breakfast place around the corner  the coffee was excellent and my wife enjoyed her iced tea drink  the atmosphere is intimate and it seems like it would be a great place for a date  well be back for sure 
horrible   horrible   horrible    customer service the employee who took my phone order took my credit card information and did not ask for my name yelled and hung the phone up on me i called back to make sure the information was correct provide my name and she scream  why are you calling i said its ok  and processed to hung the phone up on me again  i drove to the restaurant to cancel the order did not feel comfortable knowing she took my credit card information and was so nasty i thought my personal information could be exposed to the wrong person  i asked for her name she refused to give me anything told me to get out she is done never had a customer like me and started to talk to the rest of the staff about the situation  this form of customer service is ridiculous disrespectful and i dont understand how this could be fair to a customer in any shape or form 
i was being treated for my birthday to a spa day and my girlfriends took me to spa lamar    i had the pleasure of spending my birthday afternoon getting the palm and sole reflexology treatment and honestly   i couldnt imagine a better way to celebrate my new age  the therapist performing the reflexology was an incredible masseuse  my feet felt completely pampered and relaxed  i am on my feet most of the work day and i felt like i had gone to heaven after my treatment   the facilities were perfect   i spent about an hour before my treatment lounging around in the spa  spending time in the desert island sauna  blue lagoon steam room and the bermuda whirlpool  all of these amenities were included for free during my day spa visit  i had a very memorable and relaxing experience and will be coming back as well as bring my friends    thanks
nice little yogurt shop  nice location  good service  free wifi  what more could you ask for 
the first few times i went there it was really good but i went there today and my pita was half the size that it normally is for  8 i dont think so
every year joe does a customer appreciation meal which brings out long lines that are worth it  delicious hamburgers and plenty of outside seating to enjoy  especially during the spring and winter months  beautiful gigantic trees provide plenty of shade  kids meals include a sucker 
wow  this place is bad  we used to go quite often to the sapporo in las vegas which has long since closed  were visiting scottsdale so we thought wed try the original  our teppan chef was honestly frightening  he burned our rice and his giggle ridiculous  i honestly think he is crazy  he tried to flip burned eggs into one of the patrons mouths  what the heck   the meat was undercooked and some was over cooked  i cant believe that a place like this would allow cooking so bad  how do you undercook eggs that are burned on the outside  really gross  i have to say truly one of the worst meals ive ever had    doesnt anyone from management see whats going on here 
i loved my food and martini  the bruschetta selections were awesome  this is a nice addition to my neighborhood 
from living in new jersey  i can attest that the italian style food served here is the real deal  from the pizza to pasta  everything is exceptional  not only is the food great  but the service is truly exceptional  all the waiters are extremely attentive and clear plates immediately  are open to questions  refill water as soon as you finish  and our waiter even wiped off the spilled balsamic vinegar from the table within seconds  the interior is super modern and very well designed with bar seating as well  great price too  cannot say enough about this place     get the nutella pizza  not on the menu  a hidden gem  
the food and service were somewhere between less than average and average  one of the people in my party asked for a water twice and never received it  i had to ask twice and finally got one  i ordered the hamburger  which was actually good  but the roll was so bready that i needed that water to swallow each bite  the fries were hot and crispy  which was nice to balance off the burger  there has to be a better choice than going back there again 
love this neighborhood bar  personable staff  fun ascetic  and great food  really excited to come watch packer games here   thank you pierce 
wow  horrible  went there last night with my son  i ordered the tavern burger with french fries  the burger was luke warm and tasted really bad  the french fries were sooogy and oily  my son had the chicken tenders with ent potato chips  the chicken tasted like rubber and his chips were soaked in oil and raw  i dont give reviews but i had to for this one 
the bella suite are beautiful     good location       big rooms     you can ask for more   
the doctors and staff at this location are very caring and knowledgeable  very clean office  up to date equipment  a special thanks to dr  ting and dr  utley for their professionalism and hard work on my challenging case 
i would consider this dealership to be no less than outstanding in the handling of my purchase of a 2013 tahoe ltz     the sales staff  especially mr  corbin sweat had helpe my wifwe and i throughjout the start which was back in november of 2012  corbin or no other salesperson pressured us into a decision but  he certainly went over and above with his knowledge and kindness  he gets a ten plus rating for honor and self esteem  my chevey dealer will continue to be ron marhofer in stow  ohio  job well done mr  corbin sweat  the year is 2  2017 and my opinion is somewhat different     over past three years we have had tire rim issus on our 2013 tahoe ltz every time we want it for the reason why  we here the same  bs   it s cause hot n cold temps outside  rims corrosion need cleaned etc at  49 95 a pop   now just last month  we took it in again and demanded resolution what we got us  oh not our fault  i then asked about gm policy  they said the rims are three years old  lol   i asked why did they bit replace while in warranty  they did not need to do so at that time  then i said in the first year i had the tahoe in for and other service work did you not replaced them at that time while in warranty  mgr said he did not know  he did not work at marhofrr then and issue was never placed on record  so  if i want the rims replaced now  it will cost us  783 56 each plus labor  screwed again          respectfully  thomas dean fop 123   associate lodge 68 administrator hudson  ohio
great prices  good is very good  fast service  you cannot beat this small restaurant  also  very clean and neat  very friendly service  tom dean hudson  ohio
good food nvservice here  medium range menu prices  could be better  we may try it again 
we all ordered our food  service at this point was good  my chk marsalauce looked as if the sous chef really screwed up  slightly burnt sauce n little to no mushrooms   terrible  sent back   my wife had meatballs  served cold with no sauce and a roll torn open  this was not a good experience and would suggest the food for a dog   dinners beware      
best thin crust slice in town  my favorite lunch spot  affordable and the staff is always friendly  they have a huge menu  much more than pizza 
these people were absolutely clueless when it came to taking care of children  they always forgot to feed my daughter and she would come home with nasty clothes on from where they were to lazy to use a bib on her  they never seemed to change her diaper and they treated her mother bad when she would say anything about it  the center was disgusting and my kid was always getting sick  they did not care that she had asthma and they would do things to stir it up then refuse to let her mother leave and take her to the doctor  they endanger childrens lives all the time and they should probably be shut down  if i could get them 0 stars i would 
great sushi   the staff is always super friendly and fast  its defiantly worth a try  the crispy rice with spicy tuna is amazing as well other unique rolls  they also have a great selection of non sushi items 
this place is delicious  overall  the food was great and the owner and staff were friendly  try the cripsy beef that is listed under the chefs specilities  its better than any meat dish and its not even meat 
the roasted elote is amazing   everything else i tried was okay  nothing special  but a good size portion for happy hour  service is a little slow 
wow   we discovered a great place today  their pizzas are amazing    made from scratch  loved the crust and the flavor  we ordered tuscan chicken as well  it comes with garlic knots and house salad with their secret house dressing   their staff is very friendly and i am sure to come back again for their food and service 
i was having my car serviced in the area and decided to try this semi new restaurant for brunch   this place has been open for a little over a year and it seems like theyve worked out any kinks that undoubtedly come with being new   now  as its name suggests  this is a family restaurant and my expectation is tasty  no frills and hearty food   i ordered the denver omelet with egg whites   it was a hearty sized omelet and balanced well with ham  onions  peppers and american cheese  omelets come with home fries   they were beautifully cooked  but terribly unseasoned  i added quite a bit of salt and pepper   i also ordered a half order of biscuits and sausage gravy   first  the half order was very nicely portioned and could satisfy someone looking for a smaller potion   the biscuit itself was very nice  tender and buttery   the sausage gravy had a very velvety consistency and meaty  but  like the home fries  was under seasoned   also  this is served with home fries  but i asked for grits instead  which they were happy to substitute   the grits  as expected were plainly cooked offering a blank palate for savory or sweet pursuits   for the food you get  position size and quality  the price point is excellent   you can eat well here for under  15   lastly  the staff here is excellent  the service is kind  competent and swift   i enjoyed my experience here and would highly recommend you try this place out  especially if youre looking to support local small business 
based on the reviews  i was expecting a whole lot more from this neighborhood gem   first  the best thing going for this place is its quaint  romantic dining room  the two tables near the window are very cute and offer a nice alternative to a traditional table or sitting at a bar   second  the service was just good  i had to ask of their were specials and then for how much they cost  i expect a server to offer the special right away   third and most importantly  the food  this is where umami loses lots of points for me  we ordered 5 dishes  1 app  2 small plates and 2 large plates  2 dishes had soy in them  buckwheat noodles with seared tuna and fried vegetable roll with sauce   yet both were under seasoned   the tuna was cooked perfectly  but when its atop bland noodles and cauliflower  throwing soy sauce on it isnt an effective fix  the other dishes werent memorable  the goat cheese dumplings were a faint attempt at sophistication  but lacked flavor  the edamame hummus served with crispy wonton skins  that was tasty  however it was studded throughout with whole roasted garlic  which should have been very nice  but the garlic was undercooked and still had a bite   the last dish was the udon noodle dish  which was also soy based  and the beef  noodles and vegetables were well cooked  but again was terribly under seasoned   in summary  all the dishes had great potential  but all of them failed poorly at achieving what the restaurants name suggests   umami   i will not recommend this place  unless youre looking to only share saki with someone special in a romantic setting 
wow     where do i begin  from the awesome wine tower that requires a circus act to reach many of the bottles  to the ambiance  and of course the fabulous food   most amazing   we were lucky to be in vegas during restaurant week so every dining establishment offered special prix fixe menus for  50 so we took advantage of that  the appetizer selection said  choose two per person  but we figured  no way     but indeed  it was true  they werent small plates either    the appetizers alone  we had the hoisin style calamari  ceviche  steak and naan  and artichoke dip  filled us up with goodness  but we had to get through two regular sized main entrees  i had the porcini and artichoke ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale  and totally forgot they came with sides until those were set a few minutes later    yeesh    oh  and a quartet of desserts to end with    what can i say  top it off with impeccable service  and you have quite the winner    the only  complaint  i have  and i dont know if it even falls as one  is that the waiter assured us these plates were small since  after all  it is a tasting menu    and as i said  if those were tasting plates  they mustve been from green giant land  i get full thinking about this meal 
great local business  works with left field brewery too and my husband and i love it 
to start  i had the wrong attitude coming to this place   ive eaten at dish on central  several times  and its just common   i heard these restaurants are related   dish is your typical southern food that tastes like what your grandmother makes  haberdish  is that  but with an amazing culinary expansion   everything we are was fantastic   i wasnt raised in the south  so the typical southern fare isnt familiar to me and doesnt strike that childhood chord  but this place blew me away  i was caught off guard to say the least    the biscuit with bacon jam is one of the best dishes in charlotte   and the fried chicken  forget about it 
definitely coming here again   quick service  great tasting food  and overall good experience   was a recommendation from a local barista   so glad because i visited another  mexican  restaurant in phoenix and was sorely disappointed  i almost gave up in searching for actual mexican food 
great atmosphere  quaint setting  food was delicious    highly recommend     gusto 101 is also delicious 
the food was great  the waitress was very attentive and stopped by several times to check on us  i had the pastrami reuben and can i say it was delicious  the pastrami was overflowing from the sandwich and the sauce was very tangy and good  i wish we had a chompies in my home town  i will definitely be back when we come to visit the family  by the way the sliders are amazing too  and how can you pass up the deli case on the way out without getting a cannoli     mmmmm 
so freaking good  they serve dim sum all day which is awesome  i had great service with a group and alone  they food is so fresh and flavorful  everything is delicious and great prices   im trying not to go every day 
fantastic   definitely in the running for top 10 meals ever  wonderful wine selection  beautiful presentation  sophisticated service and the food is phenomenal 
i followed my hairstylist julie to new attitude from another salon in monroeville  i would have followed her anywhere  but i am extremely pleased that she chose to go to new attitude  this salon has the best atmosphere  very clean  and everyone is so nice and they all make you feel right at home  love it there   if your looking for a new salon dont hesitate making an appointment 
come here only after break ups  depressions  these sandwiches will make your body feel like it only has a couple minutes to live    i would suggest taking at least half the fries off the sandwich if you want to taste anything else    this is a place thats worth a try once to talk about how ridiculous it is  but nothing more  not something i would crave ever again 
we stopped in for a snack one afternoon after wandering through the shops at the venetian  i was hoping for some little sliders so we could sample the burgers but they only had full size burgers and a very limited menu  we opted instead to split the lobster roll and it did not disappoint   the bun was buttery and it was chocked full of hunks of lobster   i would definitely order this again   hubby got a baileys chocolate milkshake and said it was so good  he would have ordered another one if we had stayed longer  i got a blood orange cosmo and it was delicious  the only thing that could have been better was the service  we sat at the bar and evidently the manager was taking care of things while the bartender was on break  she said little to nothing to us  took our orders  filled them and we never saw her again  the bartender returned and we flagged him down to ask a few questions about where to order king crab in the city  he was nice enough but not really engaging  we will definitely go back to try the burgers 
best french dip i have ever had  it was so good  the hummus and cheese are awesome too  the staff is really nice 
i recently moved and arizona keys rekeyed all my locks   levi was quick  professional  and offered suggestions on how to increase the security of my home 
obviously a business that thrives on one time only visits  i e  tourists   im a local and i wont  be going back  1   drive thru took about 20 mins  2   i ordered only one thing     a classic grilled chicken sandwich  was one of the driest sandwiches ive ever had  3   the help cant speak nor understand english  i guess i shouldnt be that surprised  oh well 
absolutely in love with this place  i always take someone new with me to try out this place  the prices are great and so is the service  you have to try the choor bazaar ka tikka it is finger lickin good 10  10 
based on friends recommendations we used blue agave to cater to our offices grand opening event  serving some 75 people    value pricing and delivery ahead of schedule    service was awesome and their rep helped setup the venue after he arrived    the food was delicious  and we still get queries from our clients asking who we had cater our event    really killer salsa  and im a salsa snob  combined with tasty dishes made for a successful event    whether its a casual dinner out for yourself  or if you need catering for large groups  you cant go wrong with blue agave    do yourself a favor and stop in or order their catering today   
love the food here the grilled beet tariaque really good suchi is the best love love it affordable price and the lunch boat that they have
this is not the typical buffet      we came here on thursday night and my o my     this place is packed    when you see 95  of this chinese restaurant are asian  then u know its good  it is not easy for senior citizen to go out and eat in the restautant    but i could see soo manyyyy of them there and they actually enjoying the food    food   handpulled noodles and fresh sliced noodles    peking duck crispy skin   the longevity soup is really good just like homemade   dimsum   the har gaw is super but siomay and crry fishballs    they have pork knuckles very well season and lots of other seafoood dishes    they also have fried and grilling area for different kinds of food   sushi is not much choices but sashimi is fresh  dessert  they have dong shui  tofu fa  moon cake  and nothing special     other than the waffles    they were salty yuckk drink i ordered the hot tea and they served it in double isulation cup so cute      but they dont sell it there  but overall    this place has good food for the price you pay and i will come again if i am in the area    
the best threading place to go to  awesome prices and a great job every time  i get my eyebrows and upper lip done and its so worth it 
pleasantly surprised by the hybrid  thoroughly enjoyed my experience  loved the food 
place was ok  the food wasnt all that great  few things we ordered   half rack ribs with mash potatoes and fries   stuff mushrooms calamari  ribeye steak with asparagus and mash potatoes  ahi tuna and chips pizza pazookie   chocolate cookie with ice cream   the service was great and towards the end of the meal the manager came to serve us  which i thought was weird but whatever  overall i would only come back if i had too  i wouldnt personally pick this place if i wanted to go eat 
i went with a group of friend and the food is mediocre and over priced  below are what we ordered   bod and doug burger  good superfood salad  not good  theres cumin in the vinaigrette   which is very odd  the kale was blanched  nothing special  i can make it at home  though i would not put cumin in it  thai fighter  meh    for  19 i would expect something more stand out  the chicken bits were dry    i would not recommend unless you want to go just for the ambiance  no comments on drinks as i didnt order any  would rather spend my money on a hole in a wall for a great food experience
5 star service from brad and american  zero pressure from this company and they actually provided quite a comprehensive and what i felt to be an honest evaluation of my aging system  brad and stan were great throughout and they were the cheapest of 3 quotes to replace my unit   they also had the best warranty   easy choice 
i really like terrace  and i like that they are locally owned and operated  while i cut my teeth at the piedmont row location  i found this ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well   the space was once something else   and i ate there once  it wasnt very memorable  so i was super excited to see that terrace was moving in    having been for dinner  3 stars   i direct my attention to their extensive breakfast and brunch offerings  5 stars   i have had several menu items here  but the standouts are     oatmeal  so  so good    omelette with tomato  spinach and mozz  if they feel like letting me have mozz that day  since its not on the omelette menu    red velvet waffle  not for the faint of heart  quite sweet     blueberry pancakes   i appreciate that theyre trying to do the dinner thing  but its just not happening  id recommend going for breakfast  lunch  they serve breakfast every day until 2 30     im getting hungry    who wants to meet me for lunch 
ive only  been here to see improv charlotte  but i absolutely love the space  love  especially that you have to walk up the stairs to get in  it kind of feels like a super secret thing  well  except for the sign   a dead giveaway    oh  and they serve wine  boom    note  its now called upstage 
threes is a simple place that is doing a few things well  we walked in at lunch and ordered two sandwiches and a salad to split  i was really impressed with the veggie sandwich  lots of pesto   and bens modified banh mi was also tasty   they can also do custom sandwiches and salads  which works out nicely if you have special dietary needs   drinks from a well stocked cooler or soda fountain  and they have a large selection of wines and local beer on tap  props for the local selections   i love the space   it would be great for an afternoon meeting or book club  not that im in a book club     as for parking  we always end up in the metered spots just down from the shop and it works out just fine    i like threes and hope to wander in again soon  especially as long as that veggie sandwich stays on the menu 
holy crap  the worst service ever   first visit  waited an hour and a half to switch out of a car that got a busted tire coming from san jose  ca  all they had was an suv  ok thats fine  but over an hour to get switched out of the car   second visit  waited two hours  to switch back into a full size the promised me  two hours  go to hell man  thanks for trying so hard to get me into a full size  and ended up in a lincoln mk s  but that wait pissed me off  im never renting with budget again 
i am not very much of a cathedral guy what i would say is that the cathedral is much more beautiful from the outside  inside is a bit of a deception  despite the stunning glass windows  unlike most of the cathedrals  this very one has a shape of a greek cross  instead of the more common catholic one  there is a small chapel once there worth to get in  richly decorated with craft and art  eventually  once outside  the builing shows again a majestous shape in concordance with the tone and colours of the royal mile  it is ok  but dont dwell too long in there if you are to visit more stuff
professional  courteous and knowledgable  i have had first choice clean my carpets numerous times and there is no other business i would give my money to  if you want your carpets done right then first choice is your only choice 
stopped in for a drink    people are inside enjoying themselves bartender came and served us fast drink was great didnt try the food but the drinks service and atmosphere was awesome  good music was playing  tvs where all sports lol thats a plus for me  parking was not hard to find theres a parking lot and parking right next to it on the street  i will be coming back
have stayed there a couple of times throughout the years  have never had a bad thing to say until this weekend  booked a room for the weekend but only stayed for one night because of mold found in the shower  when i went to check out   i told the lady checking us out and did nothing about it  not even a sorry about having a room with mold in it  if you plan on staying here be sure you dont stay in room 672 
terrible customer service     i had some drinks and appetizers  one of them being some wings   when they brought out the wings they were the wrong flavor  i told the waitress that they were the wrong flavor and she kind of looked at me funny and told me that because they didnt have a toothpick in them they must be the right order and that i must be mistaken  when i told her i was positive they werent the flavor i ordered she begrudgingly said she would go put in the order for the correct wings and she left the wrong wings on the table  since it had been a while since we ordered and we were hungry and they left the wings on the table everyone at the table had another wing   a couple minutes after the waitress left the assistant general manager came over and asked what was wrong with the wings  we told him they were the wrong flavor and he asked if we wanted a side of the correct flavor  we told him all we wanted were the wings we ordered  he said that he could do that but he would have to charge us for the wings with the incorrect sauce because we already ate some of them  we explained the situation and he told us that their policy was to have all managers come talk to customers when orders are incorrect  which was never explained to us   the waitress didnt even tell us about the manager and had only said that she was going to ring in new wings  after a few minutes of arguing with the manager we asked for our bill  which they charged us for the wrong wings  and we left  the manager was condescending the entire time and even yelled stuff at us as we left  i used to love zipps but i am never going back 
wow   what a freaking awesome show   i had wanted to check out this show after reading about it on yelp a year and a half ago  a group of girls went for a birthday  bachelorette celebration but only four of us went to this show and we definitely made the right choice  it was sexy  funny in a really un pc way and all the acts were very entertaining   you are seated in a circle with the stage right in the middle inside a circus tent  a great view no matter what seat   it was decorated with vintage items and lights and fabric   i would say one of the best shows in vegas  i would highly highly highly recommend it   if you are easily offended  please dont go  the audience participation part was hilarious 
really fresh and delicious patties  i always grab a quick one as a snack on the go  i prefer mild beef but i heard the spicy has a really good kick too    i love that theyre made fresh everyday   that its such an affordable option  definitely worth the extra cents to buy here than eat frozen ones from home  also much tastier than the ones offered at convenience stores    caution  filling is super hot so be careful not to burn your tongue 
skip to the last paragraph if you just want the summary  conclusion   we came here for their all you can eat crab leg buffet during lunch  we had gone to the crab leg buffet at casino arizona just the week before  so we were really coming here to compare  at first glance  i was very excited  it looked a lot more elegant than the one at casino arizona  and they actually had crab crackers and other crab utensils  i dont know what theyre called    casino arizona only offered nut crackers  which are terrible for crab   their food selection was very small  however  and that was disappointing   my first plate of crab was mostly water   hardly any meat  which was bland  that was very disappointing  i ended up getting some of their prime rib and mashed potato and it was pretty mediocre  i had almost given up until i went back and noticed the crab looked different  it was redder   so i gave the crab another shot   it tasted better  but still pretty mediocre  we then came up with the conclusion that perhaps the buffet was just inconsistent about their quality  we were right  we waited until we saw a new batch of crab legs that looked a very nice red color  that plate was delicious  in fact  perhaps even better than casino arizonas  but not by much  we also went back for prime rib again when it looked a little more medium rare  the prime rib was absolutely delicious  too  unfortunately  there was not much to say about their dessert  or about any of their other items  everything else was either mediocre or nasty   all in all  the experience was pretty good  the quality of the food was good  but inconsistent  their service was not too bad  but better than casino arizonas  i also think their price was like  1 cheaper  unfortunately  because of the inconsistency with the quality of their food  as well as the lack in variety of buffet foods  i dont think we will be going back anytime soon  casino arizonas buffet is about the same  with a much more consistent quality  and also a much closer drive for us  however  if you are looking for a crab buffet with some good prime rib  this is the place to go 
i honestly do like their ice cream  liked the thai tea soft serve so much that i went back two days later to get it again  the product is fine  the delivery not so much   i fully understand having to wait if there are a lot of people and have no issues with it  heck ive waited 1 5 hours for a cheesecake before  when i went back there was literally only two people in front of me  the girl at the cash was great  friendly and engaging but i have no idea why she couldnt help with making the ice cream if there were no other people in line and everyone is just waiting  the guy making the ice cream was super slow  not slow as in paying attention to detail but slow as in i dont know if he woke up yet  it was painful to watch and wait  i got soft serve in a cup  its suppose to be super quick and easy but i waited almost 10 minutes  i got a small before and a large this time   there was no difference 
i have been to this starbucks numerous times  never had an issue before today  the starbucks is literally a mile maybe from my school so i go wait in the drive thru but its taking to long so i go inside  place my order the girl was very pleasant and polite  after waiting 5 min and seeing people who ordered their drinks after mine get theres  i started to get annoyed but i remained patient  then the baristas started to have a private conversation  than i got annoyed because now im apparently invisible  i go to the counter and ask about my drink the guy stats   oh sorry your cup is just sitting back here   well no shit  that was my limit told him   i dont have time to wait  i would like a refund   as im  waiting in line again to get my refund a nice customer saw how annoyed i was and offered her spot  get to the cashier and by that time the guy made my drink and said its on the house  so now im just insulted to the fact that it took you less than 2 minutes to make my drink and i waited over 15 min  the girl at the register didnt even know how to do a return on a card  i couldnt wait any longer for her to figure it out  i left this starbucks this morning in the worst mood  but im not going to let it bring down the rest of my day  i just wont return and i hope if you read this you drive an extra block to the next starbucks  have a great day 
love this place  always a great place to sing and chill with friends  they have good selection of different genres from old to current  highly recommended 
we have great things to say about this daycare  our main reason for sending our children here was for the organic and natural food as well as the natural environment  we also love that for holidays and birthdays the kids dont get candy or unhealthy treats from their friends  but then  once we got to know the staff after joining in june 2017  we have been treated so wonderfully  everyone is friendly and compassionate  they have worked with us through some transitions and have been fair and empathetic  im also impressed so many of their staff know every parent and childs name and call them by it  the curriculum and class activities are exemplary as well  during our first parent  teacher conference we were thrilled to hear of the things the teacher is doing with the kids that we hadnt noticed from the curriculum or from being in the classroom  we feel very fortunate to have found nca 
my boyfriend took me here for our 1 year anniversary  and it was fantastic   we both love steak and were staying at the mirage  which made getting dressed up to go out very easy   we knew it would be pricey  but i know for the perfect steak it is worth the price   for every steakhouse i base my review on the cut of steak they started with  and how it is cooked   some places start out with a bad cut of meat and still cook it right  and other places have a beautiful slab of meat that they absolutely destroy   and depending on the repuation of a place  i will order the rareness of my steak differently     when we had dinner at stack  i took the risk and ordered my ribeye steak medium   it was called the tomahawk steak with the bone in  when it came to the table  i was floored    it was a beautiful thick cut ribeye still attached to the full bone  which extended impressively off the plate about 12  or more   the presentation alone was magnificent   and then the taste was spot on    they used a type of herbed butter  but it did not take away from the taste at all   it was a perfect medium  not too rare and not overcooked   it is places like this that make me want a steak dinner every day    my boyfriend ordered the fillet    and it was perfectly tender     almost like butter  i am so glad he shared a bite with me   we also shared the asparagus with truffle hollandaise which complemented the steak perfectly   to finish it all off  we had the creme brulee with cherries    it was fantastic  again  the presentation was so fanciful  as it came in a thin swirly dish in the shape of a slender  s      they have a decent wine menu and are a must go steakhouse for whenever we return to vegas 
not a bad time at all  great location too  everything was pretty good except the manhattan and they could add a few more irish whiskeys to the menu  good atmosphere and i like the idea of being able to play bocci while drinking 
it is pretty cool to watch them roll the ice cream  if i am in tempe i will go back again 
i found myself wanting a massage over labor day weekend  id been holding out for a great groupon  but everyone was booked solid  i was able to make an appointment at massage envy for the next day  ivonne worked magic on my sore shoulders and upper back  she is a miracle worker  massage envy is a reliable chain  im not a fan of their sales pitch after youve been kneaded into bliss but theyre required to try to beat that massage high out of you with memberships and packages 
i dont know about the other reviews but this place is amazing  went on a sunday night and had a blast  had free shots  danced just a great time  the bartenders are amazing    the drinks where very good  specially when you ask them to make you something good  they customize you a drink yummy   i cant wait to go back 
of course its a holiday weekend  we have a pool party planned  and our pool pump is not working  i start calling around praying i can get someone to come look at it and this nice gentleman answers the phone  i start explaining my issues and he facetimes me to walk me through how to fix our pumps issues  thank you  thank you  thank you   your were amazing  so sorry i didnt get your name but would absolutely recommend this company  
friendly atmosphere and great location   and i absolutely love that that every corner of the store isnt jammed with merchandise  very comfortable with some unique pet items 
wonderful escape to the past is what it feels like   a diamond in the rough
i was in the store at the beginning of the week and  went through cynthias line  and although she was busy she had such a nice  smile on her face   makes it pleasant for the customer and  makes you smile too  cynthia welcomes her customers   and asks how you are  with that smile  a good start to your day    
love this place awesome cheesesteaks and hoagies and with the back east attitude simply reminds me of philly 
great experience with this location  the young ladies are prompt and professional and they make dropping off my dry cleaning quick and pleasant  this organization is taking dry cleaning to the next level  and it is incredibly helpful to have your clothes cleaned in 24 hours  the email notification is incredibly appreciated as well  helps to remember to pick things up 
2nd time there today and the service was far worse than my 1st experience there  the staff today was rude and extremely unprofessional  laughing loudly at customers and rough housing with one another  when the customer realized that it was her that they were laughing at  she left in tears   i arrived at approximately 6pm requesting a gel manicure and brow wax  after the guy started with my nails  about 40 mins later the brow technician came over to other male manager and said goodbye  i quickly asked if she was not going to complete my brow service and was told i could come back tomorrow  not asked  told matter a factly by the male manager that i could come back tomorrow  i said that wasnt an option as i had plans to entertain in my home this evening  he said sorry and proceeded to ignore me  then he and 2 other employees walked to the front laughing and joking to the brow tech   once my service was complete  i left and will not be back  not sure what happened there between the 1st time i was there 2 weeks ago and today but i would not return for free service if given  if i could give 0 stars i would 
im impressed with their professionalism  reasonable prices and customer service  i highly recommend them 
short lines and a quick check out  nice selection of premade meals to choose from  the liquor meet makes for a quick check out if you only have a few items 
the dynamite roll on happy hour is great  the mahi tacos and sliders are awesome  so far i havent found 1 thing that is not amazing  definitely recommend this restaurant  
the apps where good but when we had a problem with the temp on our burger the waiter got a little rude 
more of an occasional sweet treat place due to mildly high price  love the mini ice pack they give you in the bag to keep chocolate from melting in vegas heat  i dont have sweet tooth but it was good chocolate 
easily the best bbq in vegas   the duke fries are absolutely amazing and dont forget about the gods sauce   
very delicious   wife had apple and brie burger  i had the big kahuna  both were fantastic 
went here on a whim  it was the only place open  the atmosphere over all was a bit different than most sushi restaurants that i have been to  it was very loudly decorated  the waitress brought out miso soup and a small salad almost as soon as we sat down  which i loved  the waitress was very attentive and accommodating  the sushi was not cheap  but it never is  is it  we ordered the boston roll it was good  definitely the first time i have ever seen melted cheese on top of sushi  it was an interesting twist  but it was good  we also go the spicy   spicy roll  which was delicious  it was not overly spicy  so of course i added a large amount of wasabi  we also got the fresh yellowtail roll  i love raw fish  so i loved it  the last one we got was called the midnight roll  it had a weird flavor that i did not care for  but my boyfriend seemed to like it  lastly  the  free desert  was half a sliced apple and half of an orange with whipped cream  caramel sauce drizzled on the top and two chocolate sticks  it was light and refreshing  but still sweet  overall  i enjoyed my visit  i will most likely eat there again 
my husband and i went to see the mac king comedy magic show at 1 pm on a tuesday  and had a great time   it is a funny show  with lots of audience participation   the magic tricks are good and traditional  tricks youd see at any magic show   what makes the show great though  is mac king himself  he has a great  quick sense of humor  with adult jokes tucked in  he cleverly does it though  and kids will miss the true meaning of them   we had a good laugh  and were left scratching our heads as to how some of the tricks were done   we are still trying to figure it out  i highly recommend this show  great for families 
okay this was my second trip to global   the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight  we were greeted by a uppity hostess   who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of  i understand   we did not have a reservation  but it was a tuesday night and it was 6 pm and no one was there    no one other than myself and the waiters  she did say she would try and i went to the restroom and came back out and she   said  possibly we could sit at the bar   so we took it  a party of three   and we were happy to be there  it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where you are going to spend your money and they act indifferent to you   we started out with a bottle of boom boom sirah  it was good  we ordered 3 appetizers   the mediterranean lamb  the berkshire pork belly  and butternut squash  soup    soup was good  pork belly can do no wrong  ever and the lamb   not quite good and way to tough and well done  we then ordered the sea bass and the open raviolio  the open raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes  zucchini and wet veggies   not really there  the sea bass looked beautiful  the top 1  2 inch was edible the rest  was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass  not able to cut or eat  they did take it off the menu   the waiter   chris  was very good    he was the bright light of the restaurant    the restaurant  was almost good  not quite  not worth another trip back  oh yea and it was very high priced for a not great place    
cute little bar  love the whole idea   think they could expand on it a tiny bit more  if you are paying 14 to 16 dollars for a tropical drink  then give the people the coconut shell  drink menu was exotic and tropical  small plates were good  but all in all the prices were high  and most of us in our party of six walked away hungry   i think i would go back   sit at the bar and watch them make my drink which was suppose to have 4 shots of rum   to see what kind of measuring device they were using   
tucked away in a small strip next to a gas station is a little gem of a place called lucy s bakery  very nice owner who explained his culture and his food items to us  wonderful empanadas and arepas   such delicious pastries with dulce and guava   cute little storefront restaurant  worth the drive if you are in charlotte but only open till 5 pm on weekdays  so come early  
loco lime  i would have to be loco to go back there  not a favorite in my book  starting out the place was freezing  no heat  hard to be excited about drinking a ice cold jalapeno margarita   which was the best thing i had all night  in the cold  chips and salsa were average   the hottest salsa was not hot even though we were warned about it  ordered the fried jalapenos   pretty good  hot when served   ranch dip does not go with it   then i ordered the chile rellenos i order them all over   always looking for the ultimate one  i ask for the ranchero sauce on the side to make sure i dont get a limp relleno  well limp it was  both of them  yes   piggie here ordered two  thats what i get  both in a limp pancake like batter that was not appealing at all  the filling was not chihuahua cheese     it was the cheese sauce from the queso  my plate was overwhelmed with a   coleslaw  it was in a sweet honey dressing but had parmesan cheese on the top  what kind of mexican place uses parm   the coleslaw sat on a bed of fried  yesterday  plantains   soggy and stale tasting  the beans and rice were plain and untasty  not a cheap menu and not a menu i will be looking at again 
i must say that this storage facility is the best customer orientated facility i have ever used  dealt with connie on some very special situations and she was a real professional in helping me on my matters great gated location with very clean facilities also have a truck available for move in or out if you need storage this is the place you need to consider 
based on the yelp reviews my wife and i came here to get away from the conference hotel for some real food  having grown up in florida  now living in california and having been to louisiana many times i was eager to try this place  the crawfish pie is a classic ive only had in louisiana but they did it justice  we had a sampling of about half the menu  the fried pickles and green tomatoes were both standout apps  the jambalaya was also pretty amazing  yall go here now  ya here 
this review is for ross turchaninov who works at this practice  i came to see dr ross on referral to help me with frozen shoulder  i had a subluxation with a partial tendon tear and adhesive capsulitis  the year before dr ross  i had had a cortisone injection and 5 months of physical therapy 3 times a week for 2 hours  the physical therapy relieved some pain and restored some flexibility but only got me back to about 70  of normal function  frustrated i quit  a year later i went to see dr ross after i lost most of the flexibility in my shoulder and dealt with constant aching pain  in 1 short month of visits that involved massage and manipulation plus at home stretching 3 times per day  i am at 95  shoulder function  i can even throw a baseball again  something i havent been able to do in 2 years    if your looking for conservative treatment of pain  i highly recommend you give dr ross a try     
i called at 2 30 am to see if this was a pet friendly hotel  i was assured it was  i arrived for check in at 3 30am  i was then told that the only person working  one for the whole hotel  was on lunch break and not back for an hour  after waiting an hour we were told there are no pet rooms available  i then told him that i asked him at 2 30 if there were are any rooms  he then said he was the only person answering phone calls and he would never say  there were rooms when there werent  he basically called me a liar and cast me away 
excellent choice   found this place by accident while on vacation  stopped in for a smoothie  bff smoothie  and also picked up the banana leather with cashew butter  what and excellent choice  planned to just eat one or two pieces  but ate all 5 strips  it was that good  the cashew butter was an amazing addition   the smoothie was excellent also 
the one thing that is first and foremost about any type of dining establishment is people  hey  thats what i am  a person  and im betting thats what you are too  so  if the people are made of good stuff  well that equals service  its there  in people  like you and like me  rather you feel it or not on your sometimes limited lst time experience  people service profit  none of my concern  profit  but i really get the people and service thing  and thousands like me get it to  cause thats the experience youll get every time when step into the dining experience at the watershed  i mean good food  good music  oh  and good people  its ambience experience is matched by none south of frank lloyd  right in your backyard  its like your hometown bar away from your hometown 
this little brewery is a gem   the beer is really special  we had the brown noser brown ale  super smooth  family owned and great service  the shirts are pretty cool too     get your own freakin beer    dont come hungry because there isnt a food menu  come thirsty 
i couldnt decide what to order  so on darias recommendation  i tried the bbq pulled pork sandwich  it was fantastic  the pork was extremely tender and perfectly seasoned  the homemade bbq sauce was delicious as well  i like the sandwich better than bjs brew or gordon b    give it a try and tell daria i recommended it   
good spot for a quick sandwich if you dont feel like eating fast food  the sandwiches are just okay  nothing special but a good deal as all of the sandwiches are about  6 and its convenient as a late night snack if youre staying in planet hollwood or near the hotel after getting out from the clubs 
do not bring your bike here for repairs if you want it in safe riding condition when you leave   handlebars shifted  shifter fell off and gas tank was not sealed properly  causing gas to leak  all after 1 week of getting  her  back   lane splitters had  her  for 11 weeks  after quoting 9 hours were needed for cosmetic repairs   if i could give 0 stars i would   brian is incompetent and unprofessional   if you are looking for a good shop for your harley i would recommend iron horse if you want someone to care about you  your safety  and more importantly your bike 
very mediocre chain mexican food  ordered tacos that were super dry and then got charged for aioli   seats were uncomfortable and service was very average 
the room was great  we had a tower room  for added security you had to use your room card in the elevator to go anywhere which we like  the room itself had a great view and was very clean and had air conditioning which was helpful for the hot weather  i would give it more stars  but as far as the slots and games at the palace station  they were not giving any money back even after i put in 200 00   next time if i have to opportunity to stay there  i will just sleep there and take the shuttle to the strip and walk across the street to the wynn where i had alot more luck 
i called this company to drive a mile from their shop and give me a battery jump   steve said they couldnt do that   if i needed a jump  they would have to tow my car   i said ok  how much to tow me to my dealer 4 miles away at the auto mall   steve said  we dont do that   we sell batteries  we only tow to our shop   i dont even want to think about how ridiculous a tow and battery would have cost me if i was dumb enough to fall for this rip off   i called another towing company and got a jump for  55   stay away from these people 
we took some guests who are visiting from europe here last night   our experience in the past has been very good   last night  however  was very bad   when we arrived there were several tables within our sight cluttered with the remains of previous diners   we were told we would have a 15 20 minute wait for a table   we were seated before that time had expired    but then we waited for about 10 minutes before being offered water or other beverages    not acceptable especially when they were not busy   we were also short two table settings and had to ask for them from the server   when he bought them  he simply put the silverware in a pile on the center of the table and didnt bring any additional napkins   we had to ask another server to bring those   we had to ask for a replacement for one of the small plates used for bread as it was dirty   i ordered steak and frites  my wife the french onion soup  and our guests ordered the pot roast   my steak upon arrival was tepid at best and either the frites died waiting at the pass or they were microwaved   in either case they were inedible and i sent them back   neither of the servings of pot roast were hot and on one plate the mashed potatoes were downright cold   i wont write off mimis just yet as any place can have an off night and our previous experiences have been good   however i will be cautious and our next visit will most certainly not include guests 
great place for ramen that is close driving distance to the strip    this place seats about twenty people and you should be prepared to wait on a weekend    the service was very fast and friendly    this ramen place is run and owned by japanese which is always more authentic    i got a spicy tonkatsu ramen and the fried rice   the portion was very large  extra noodles for  1 50 if you like    ramen  broth hot and spicy  on the saltier side  the hot sauce was right on target  pork was super tender and fell apart easily with my chopstick  veggies nice and firm    fried rice  good size portion  plenty of veggies mixed in  nice side of ginger slice   prices  very reasonable  all the ramen dishes were under  10 bucks  fried rice portion was about  7  japanese tea for  2 beer for  3   this is a solid ramen place in vegas  never impressed  will return here again in the future 
came here a emergency running hat while i was on vacation and this place was a pleasant surprise   the owner was extremely helpful in picking out a hat for me and didnt pressure me to buy the most expensive options like some other elite running places do   there was a fairly wide selection running shoes but the prices were on the higher side   the location is in a shopping mall right next to camelback mountain so you can grab some hiking gear on the way to the summit hikes   overall  great service and good selection of running specific apparel and shoes   would come back again for sure 
back again last week nd happy to report they still rate 5 stars  i had the special of prime rib hash   watch out the regular stack of pancakes would have fed my wife twice  nice location a short walk from all the glitz of fremont street experience 
tucked away in a corner between the stratosphere hotel and olympic gardens is a treasure  once discovered  all love it  luv it frozen custard is a simple establishment with intricate creations   the creamy consistency of the custard has a stand alone flavor you could eat it without toppings  however  with an array of combination offered from maraschino cherries to hot fudge why not enjoy delectable dishes with exuberant toppings   for a few dollars less than most other ice cream establishment  you could discover a gem off the beaten path that would satisfy both wallet and palate 
same day service to get yellow jackets out of our home  just  85 to shown up and irradicate the little buggers  we will be using their services on a quarterly basis to help the pests at bau
best philly cheese steak period    hands down the best  great selection of beer friendly atmosphere friendly staff 
yea    fobs wet dream     i really hate shopping    but this is probably by far the largest chinese mall in north america    really    why cant california have something like this    all the asian malls in california are sh t compare to this  after driving 9  hours from ohio to visit our relatives in toronto  this is the first place we hit    this place really reminds me of hong kong  but the malls in hk still the best   its 2 story high  if all the parking spaces are fill  no worry  theres a underground garage  theres a lot of shops on the first floor and some on the second floor  first floor is laid out as a uniform grid of glass cubicles  i would say there are several hundred shops here  food court and restaurants on the second floor    pretty much has everything you want here  their glasses and sunglasses are much better than what i can buy in the us    much cheaper too   
jason goes out of his way to help his customers  this is the best leslies in town  the store is stocked well and i always get what i need for my pool route and personal pool  jason is knowledgeable with pool chemistry and will point you in the right direction 
ive had sushi from japan and this is by far no where near the real deal  blue fin is some what closer to what you could expect in a sushi restaurant in japan 
we ate a delicious meal at pan tonight for our anniversary  we shared the tempura shrimp  a watercress salad with mango  cucumber and avocado  sablefish with pickled mustard greens and shaved pork cheeks with bok choy   more  would like to return and try more of the selections  our server jordan was very attentive and helpful  enjoyed eating outside and hearing the two fountains  bravo 
first day in and i was trying to stop from sweating a storm  they work you hard in this gym and the teaching is applied in a practical manner    the instructor  donovan britt  is motivating  technical and can explain techniques in simple terms  he isnt over bearing and is patient with beginners    plus  the 30 day free trial doesnt hurt either  no obligation  no card taken  just come in for 30 days  free of charge  and if you like it  sign up  if not  no worries 
i enjoyed staying at this location because it is close to chinatown and diagonal from the palais de congres  it is quite clean in the rooms  the other benefits were the pool and jacuzzi  it doesnt seem like many people use these facilities because i was the only one there besides my husband 
if you want to become a big fat fattie  you have found the perfect place  there are a million permutations of toppings for the innocent little fries  i had to have the mexican with avocados  it was decent with slightly salty gravy  and rubbery cheese  goodness  i never thought rubbery cheese was good unless it was haloumi  it is alright here 
wow  ive never seen such a huge selection of pasta and tomato sauces in one place as i have in labriolas   we frequent this place at least once a week to stock up on pasta and sauce   weve even sent the sauce to family in the south  love the large selection of  frozen foods already prepared 
tldr  if you want to be treated like a human  dont come to this casino  so many better places that will treat you kindly   this review is just of the casinos staff treatment   i was walking through the casino with my parents to get back to their sister property  the signature  my parents stopped by one of the machines and my mom wanted to show me something  one of the employees stopped me and this i didnt mind because  granted  i do look young for my age and do look underage compared to others  but his attitude and the way he handled the situation appalled me  he was incredibly rude towards me and was basically accusing me of underage gambling even though we were just standing by one of the machines  he didnt even ask me for id at first  he just kept questioning me about my age and when he finally asked for my id  he didnt do so very nicely  when he finally verified my age by slowly calculating the difference between 2017 and my birth year  he just looked angry  probably because he was so excited to try and kick someone out of the casino   all he could say was  oh    you look really young     and then tried to leave hurriedly and threw a quick and angry  sorry about that  before running off quickly   look  i get it    minors try to gamble all the time and youre just trying to do your job  but youre in the customer services industry  at least try to be friendly  i was in vegas for two full days and i was carded at multiple other establishments  but none of the other casinos handled the situation as poorly as mgm grand  rather  at other casinos  i actually struck up a friendly and fun conversation with the attendants who carded me and had a lovely time speaking with them  honestly speaking  you should learn from your sister properties  they know how to do customer service right and well at their casinos 
the extraordinary customer service i received from this company compelled me to write this review   due to unforeseen circumstances i was forced to cancel my club rental   i contacted greg at phoenix golf club rentals  he responded and refunded my order within 10 min   i will absolutely be using this company in the future 
this place is awesome   theyve got anything and everything you can imagine for really good prices    bob was inviting and very helpful  we will definitely be back in the future 
dr cathleen whitcraft and her vet tech laura are an amazing team  i have to say i have been to quite a few vets in town  and i absolutely love this place  they give honest opinions and advice  also  their compassion when it came  time  for my mia will never be forgotten  unfortunately im moving out of vegas  and i will miss them a lot 
king wah is my absolute go to for chinese food  i love this place for many reasons but most of all for the taste of the food and the overall aesthetic and service    i am very picky about chinese food and any take out food  the thing i love the most is that this is a stand alone restaurant   not a storefront  the decor is beautiful and they service you similar to many of your favorite sit down eateries    the food is amazing  the flavor is great  my favorites are the pu pu platter  green beans and the lo mein  dont forget to use some of their homemade duck sauce  orange sauce   its seriously amazing    everyone is friendly here  also  the servers are very much educated about the dishes   ive never experienced long wait times for a table    the prices are great  the food is high quality so id expect the prices to be higher but they are reasonable    i highly suggest trying out the restaurant 
best gym ive ever been     high energy  high motivation  and very friendly atmosphere  if youre looking for a good work out and sweat out your fat this is the best place to be  go ahead nd try their groupon trial for one month  nd im pretty sure your gonna love the experience at revolution  hella worth it       be stronger than your excuses     
k so it takes me a lot to write a review   were from out of town and we needed to grab a bite to eat late sunday and we found this place near our hotel  i went off the reviews and honestly people who reviewed this positively must have such a sad life   i have never in my life had a worse meal  it was absolutely tasteless  i dont get it  i couldve cooked something in my hotel room off the dollar store that wouldve been a more decent meal than this   plain white rice  plain fries  chicken  white sauce that comes with it has no taste  it doesnr smell or taste like anything its just a white liquid    i can go on but seriously stay away  legit feels like i threw my money in the garbage 
went to the hot yoga class this afternoon and absolutely loved it     the energy was amazing   sandy the teacher is awesome and motivating  will be back soon  
this was a very good dining experience  having visited high end steak houses all around the world  i would say our actual food and drink experience at craftsteak was delicious and the service very nice  with some gentle requests   a table not next to the service stand  and time to enjoy our pre meal cocktail   all requests were honored  and the service and meal memorable  my only complaint   if we are dropping  500 on dinner  please do not run your vaccum until we have finished our after dinner cordial  i look forward to returning 
im not a party person  kinda a homebody actually  but i enjoyed this place a lot  the music was loud and fun  the atmosphere was great and the waiters were prompt  not a bad experience in my book 
the pug hair was starting to pile up  my broken vacuum was collecting dust  which would also need to be vacuumed up  i was in desperate need of a new vacuum  i went to sears  it seemed like the right place to go  the selection was good   a huge price range  from dyson insanity to reasonable hoovers  and a helpful salesman made the experience easy  our salesman knew way more about vacuums than i ever expect to learn and instead of forcing the most expensive model on us  he led us to a midrange one with lots of great features  the experience made me want to return to sears for household purchases and the reasonable warranty will allow me to sleep at night  knowing that our vacuum will be sucking up pug hair for years to come 
my limited experience at this location was so vastly different than the etobicoke location that i felt i must review  to begin with  the store  which is located on the 2nd floor of the bloor street pottery barn  is so much larger and well organized  there were prices on most of the items and it felt like there were far more sales people to help out  i was able to freely browse without running into angry mall people and their screaming children  if you must subject yourself to pottery barn kids  this is the location to do so 
im really not sure what has happened to alfredos   it was once a well maintained and stocked store with surprisingly fresh  local  seasonal fruits and vegetables  the store now features all varieties of wilted lettuce  halfheartedly stocked shelves and meat i would never consume  it looks to be under new management and the change has not done old reliable alfredos well 
a cool  beautiful space to drink a creamy  rich and smooth latte in  the pumpkin muffin was moist and flavourful  the music was requisitely hip 
eating a falafel as i type this  which reminds me to buy an iphone cover  i am pondering the merits and flaws of this restaurant  seeing that i am making a mess  an employee brings me over a few napkins  making me feel extraordinarily messy  but also cared for  the customer service is great here  the food is just about average  the falafel itself is moist and flavourful  but not freshly cooked  the pita is fresh but not warmed  my favorite thing about shawarmas and falafels is when they are pressed and get all toasty and warm  the toppings are fresh  the service expedient and the price reasonable  a pretty good falafel place but nothing to set it apart from other places 
i do understand all the bad reviews of windsor bridal  for me  it was exactly what i wanted  i didnt want fuss and squeals and frou frou  i had a very specific idea of the dress i wanted and wanted it at a good price without the frills of the fancy shops i had been to with friends  i brought a picture with me and in the rooms of crazy  lacy  beaded monstrosities  they had 5 dresses that were similar to the photo  in the resort section  i did not have a resort wedding  but wanted something simple  i saw the dresses  chose and was out of the shop in 45 minutes  when i came back to try it on  they were fantastic with the alterations and i bought a well priced veil as well  all in all  the exact experience i was looking for 
a delicious slice of delivery heaven  if i want to order delivery  this is my favourite place  the gianni ola with its bacon and mushrooms and soft and chewy crust makes me so very happy    this location has always served me tasty slices in store  with plenty of seating and is always prompt in delivery and pick up situations  only once did i have a somewhat creepy man hit on me while trying to order over the phone  just once  ah well  thems the breaks for tasty pizza 
we thought we would try the mandarin because we thought it would be nice to stay in a hotel without a casino   we were right about that  but the fact is that the service at the mandarin is heads and tails ahead of every other hotel in vegas i have ever stayed at    the restaurant is great  the spa magnificent  the yoga is included and also very good    room service was perfect every time and the lounge upstairs has a great view and did i mention how good the service was from the valet to the bellhops  reception  waiters  spa attendants and masseuses  it was truly the best service we have had in a long time anywhere   it is quite a bit more expensive  but it is worth twice as much as the charge   stay here  cant miss 
i cant say enough great things about steve benedetto  after speaking with countless attorneys and getting disappointed by their responses steve was able to see what most others couldnt  he is one of the most brightness  intelligent and outgoing people i have become to know  i was truly  blessed  to cross his path 2 weeks before my trial date  in 2 weeks he was able to turn my 2nd agg felony dui case from a possible 4 6 years in prison to an endangerment plea with no points on my driving record  no fine  and when all said and done left the court with a misdemeanor  thank you steve me and my family are very thankful to have had you on our side  
the fox management commented on my post offering to make up for my awful experience  i emailed her back right away and i never heard back from them  so  if you see them claiming to make up for awful reviews  just know its probably just to look nice on the yelp page  theyre not going to make up for it 
very friendly staffs   they also have usps services and you can drop off ready to go packages for ups  usps or fedex   love this store 
i hate to say it so blatantly  however  i insist  the service sucks  i ate my whole meal before my waiter came back to check on me  i wanted to order boba tea  however  it looks like to go was my only option    know what you want prior to and order everything you want while you have some one tending to your table  otherwise  youll be forgotten    frankly  seems it took everyone a while to get served their meals  digressing   price is reasonable for pho  its the first time ive had the traditional pho with tripe  etc  im not thrilled about it  the pho lacked flavor  however  there were other meals that looked delightful  ill try the restaurant again with hopes to have a better experience 
i love bbq  however  im not a huge fan  its just okay  ive tried bbq from tx  tn  ga  and even here in nc  i was actually slightly disappointed because there were so many great reviews via yelp    im fairly new to the city so ive been longing for a great bbq place  i think ill stick with sticky fingers for a good bbq plate  the service wasnt great  to be frank there seemed to be  usual customers  whom received the ultimate service  meanwhile  i was just tolerated because i was patronizing  not a fan and id hate to call it discrimination  however  i observed the waiters reaction to others     completely different   service  2 stars  bah hum bummer   food  3 stars  eh  ambiance  5 stars  love the view of the place  parking  2 stars  limited parking   overall  2
i ordered through just eats because i wanted a margherita pizza   the mozzarella wasnt fresh  but the pizza was fairly tasty   the biggest problem was i ordered a diet coke    they delivered diet pepsi   that is not an okay substitution     
the people at kartunes are fantastic  the best in products and customer service  they are knowledgeable and patient  i have used their services twice and left both times an extremely pleased customer  i want to thank josh personally who just rocks 
what a let down   the individuals that wrote good reviews on tarboosh eatery have no idea what true lebanese food is   they need to go to nates deli on w  25th street and give it a try   true foodies    stay away from this place    i would not recommend you go here   maybe they were just having a bad day but i should not have to pay for their bad days   the food was overall very bland and small portions for the price   the hummus was nothing to write home about   my husband could have had softer beef jerky on his gyro   not sure what kind of meat they put on it   the fattoosh was dry and lacked sumac  lemon  and olive oil   it looked like a bunch of old ice burg lettuce with a hunk of green pepper and a couple hunks of tomato   the rice pudding had too much rose in it   i felt like i was eating a bar of soap   i was disappointed because i have heard good reviews   again  maybe a bad day but for the money  i am not going to chance it again 
when i first went to see the toronto symphony orchestra  i was blown away  its quite the magical evening  im not a huge fan of classical music  in the sense that i may have trouble differentiating a gerswhin from a strauss  but i always love hearing it done live   first of all  you have to dress up  well you dont have to  wear whatever you want really  but how often do you get dressed up  thats what i thought  so pull out the old plaid sports coat and pop on your burgundy bow tie and youre ready to go  wait  you dont have a bow tie  alright  you can wear a regular tie but youre losing points   secondly  you really need to be on time  actually scratch that  be early  i know youre not used to that and its going to be tough  but they seriously wont let you in if youre too late  trick yourself into thinking its 30mins earlier   lastly  dont bother buying a drink or a snack at intermission  unless you have a ton of money youre looking to throw away  in which case message me directly and i can help with that  their prices are way too expensive  and if you really need a coffee to stay awake  be aware that they somehow manage to fit about 4 times the amount of caffeine into their coffee  oh sure that sounds like a good thing  but trust me  when youre strung out on caffeine while trying to sit still and enjoy the show youll know what i mean   i had always thought it was a little out of my price range until i learned about tsoundcheck  http     www tsoundcheck com     its been mentioned here a few times already  but it really makes going to the symphony much more reasonable for us youngins  ive never had a horrible seat using tsoundcheck either  so dont think youre losing out on anything  you no longer have a reason not to go 
the mississauga value village is a quiet  unassuming value village with some top quality stuff  i think there must be a lot of well off people in the area who dont like wearing stuff more than a couple times  ill generally always find an amazing sweater or a brand new shirt  and every section seems to have a nice selection of things  they focus on clothing here more so then say the electronics or furniture sections  so dont come here planning on buying a desk  not that i think you would anyway  but its never too busy and fairly neat and tidy as far as value villages go  i live in toronto  but this is definitely one that i make a special trip for as often as possible  
great products for great prices  thanks nina for the great service  will come back here asap 
ill keep it nice and simple  order chadol  bulgogi  and beef belly  top 3 prime meats for you  eat a lot of rice cause thats you how do it  fill yourself up with banchan and finish it off with some dank meat  gen is fire  so happy  very much satisfied  shout out to minju  tommy  and bo for being awesome 
pizza never delivered      i called an ordered pizza for me and my 10 year old son   gave them my cc number over the phone  which they ran    they told me my pizza would be delivered within 45 minutes   1 1  2 hours later  i call to check the status   it is friday night and i assume they are hammered   the girl who answers the phone says she cant find an order for me   after  i insist   she puts me on hold  comes back and said they had called to confirm my  20 dollar order  and that this is policy  so i havent order a  20 pizza with a stolen credit card  and that i had not answered so they did not deliver      i order from this dominos all the time   they never call to confirm    they did not call this time to confirm   very disappointed 
this place can get quite busy around dinner time as they offer a wide variety of customizable noodle soups   they have many soups to choose from  such as tomato and pumpkin  black pepper and pig stomache  parsley and preserved eggs  malay laksa  tom yum  etc  the portions are quite generous and is great for the cold winters   be careful with what you order on the little piece of paper as many things have additional costs  such as extra toppings  cold drinks  side dishes  etc   the price has been hiked up quite a bit since it first opened   i remember it starting from  7 75 per basic combo  then  8 25  now i believe its up to  9 75 
its been one of my favs for several years  above average food  spot on drinks  plenty ot tvs inside and out  im picky about fish but their friday fish fry is the best around  the cod is delicious  the customer service is excellent 90  of the time 
best spot to eat near campus  hands down  sometimes it gets a little busy but it is worth the wait  their yogurt parfaits are amazing and the chicken bbq salad is my recommendation  its healthy  so thats a good option rather than hitting up the vending machine between my classes  the location cant be beat  the atmosphere is great  and the service is top notch 
this is one of my favorite places in las vegas   its a little on the expensive side  being in the middle of downtown  but it is so so worth it    my favorite is the spaghetti and meatballs    both are homemade and are unlike anything else ive had in las vegas   my family was visiting a few weeks ago and i took them here    they were all really impressed with the food and the atmosphere   my brother was raving about it for weeks afterwards and has told all of his friends to try it   definitely go try it    my favorite is the spaghetti and meatballs    yum   if youre going on the weekend make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to wait   the secret is out and this place is hopping late into the night 
happy hour was fantastic  interesting cocktails  must have brussels sprouts and the pate
everything is top notch  food is very very delicious  service was excellent  very cool  unique ambience  i highly recommend eating here  get the market catch and the fries are some of the best ive had also  five stars
stay away   i will never take my dogs here again  i took my dogs here almost a year ago and they came home with fleas everywhere  i dont understand   we dont even have fleas in vegas  my dogs dont even get haircuts because they have short hair  i tried calling the owner but he was on vacation and the employees did not seem to care one bit  they didnt ask me to bring them in or give me my money back  i decided to give them another chance and took them again  sure enough they came home with fleas again  by the time you find them they are dead and stuck to the dogs skin  you then have to peel them off and now my dogs have open sores  i will never take my animals here again and wouldnt recommend anyone to this place 
after getting an advert in the mail touting an extensive gluten free menu  i was pretty pumped to try this place out the next time i got a craving for pizza  which is never    i called the location that has the gf menu and was told that they dont deliver to my area and that id have to call the north side location  im not driving anywhere when i want pizza  its a lazy night in  delivery kind of thing for me   so no gluten free for me  sorry  stomach   both locations i called had terrible phone service  i was given a turnaround time of an hour  and much to my surprise  it arrived after 30 minutes  i ended up pretty dissatisfied though   i ordered a buffalo wing pizza which tasted like greasy bread  they just threw slices of breaded chicken on top and a few sprinkles of buffalo sauce under the cheese  they also failed to include the ranch dressing s   that the pizza was supposed to come with  getting a whiff of ranch dressing was what made me crave pizza in the first place  ha  i ordered spicy citrus wings as well and they just tasted like    kind of spicy fried food  im bummed that the one time a year i eat pizza was such a letdown  i had high hopes for you mandys 
ive eaten plenty of less than delicious italian food  but fortunately more of the delicious kind  whether in the motherland or here at home in the states  while i had high expectations for lidias  it gets lumped into the former category  i really hate to say this  but olive gardens dishes have more flavor than those we ordered at lidias  and i dont even like og      i ordered the pasta trio and all three were oh so bland  as was my mothers lasagna bolognese  my s o  ordered the boar raviolis  i know they werent called that  but i know nothing of porcines as far as food goes  and thought they were just meh and too salty   the menu was pretty limited  and it was especially underwhelming considering the prices of the dishes  i wouldnt return here  there are a couple of other restaurants in pgh that i would rather visit next time im in the mood for italian  service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant though 
best buffet ive ever been to   drinks are included  non alcoholic of course  and almost everything is made to order aka fresh     they even have a soft serve icecream machine   nothing compares 
im a little biased because ive been going here since i was a kid and know most of the people that work there by name  and vice versa  but i have to say the quality is always good  the dishes are simple but delicious  and make sure you get the chocolate pate  great for a first date  a tenth date  a birthday  an anniversary   
i love ten   not because of the food or the drinks  but because the staff is friendly and you become almost a  local  when you visit a few times  people know you by name      they also have great specials like half price wine  and 4 dollar coronas   its also pretty     so great for dates   go in the summer when the patio is open and you can sit and sip a dirty martini  p
this is my current favourite bubbletea place  i am so glad they opened this location so close to home  i originally purchased the groupon to try it out  but have found myself coming back almost every week since   sharetea has replaced chatimes place in my books  i love the oolong milk tea here  as well as the mini tapioca they offer  the taro slush and ginger milk tea are also worth noting   this location is on street level of a residential condo complex  so parking is very limited  though you are probably better off parking at the plaza next to it and walking over   but the plus side is that it is never overly busy and the staff are always plesant 
this cute little izakaya has been around for quite a while but i never gave it a chance as i assumed it was still a dingy place run by chinese people like the prior wings place  lol   when i walked in  i was surprised to see a cute bar type style setting with many snug booth seats    we ordered tsuki roll  cheese buldak and spicy salmon roll as a small dinner and it came out to around  50 for two people  one thing that i love is that they use purple rice for everything   the service here is great  tea and water refills throughout our meal and the staff are very friendly   overall  im not sure i would come here often as if i were actually hungry  it would be very pricey to fill me up  additionally  the ventilation here isnt that great  everything from my hair to my clothing smelled of deep fried  oil  etc  yuck  p s  they have late night beer specials 
my favorite drink is the royal no 9 milk tea with tapioca  i love this location as there is usually never a line and i am in and out within 5 10 minutes   parking in this location may be a little difficult   but i usually stop by here when i am on a stroll around main street unionville anyway   there are a few small tables inside for seating a 3 4 tables outside which is quite nice   minus all the mosquitoes   ps  they have a stamp card 
this place has the best egg waffles   i honestly prefer these over the ones that can be found in the streets of hong kong that are more crispy  crunchy    tung tung egg waffles are very soft and fluffy and rich in egg flavor    though as they are constantly busy  they dont always allow for the egg waffles to cool down before stuffing them in the paper bag   making them soggy    3 for 1    5 for 2 
union summer seems much better than last years front street foods in terms of vendor prep and wait times   the most notable vendor is evas original chimneys  the hype is worth it   definitely more of a cheat day snack  or an entire meal   so delicious though   will def be back a handful of times before the end of the summer   i have also tried the lobster roll from fresh off the boat and it honestly wasnt that good  completely not worth it for  15   i can walk down the street to busters at st  lawrence market and get something much more amazing for less   overall  the food is quite pricey and small portioned here  but the availibity of seats seems to be better than last year and they have occasional entertainment nights with live bands  etc on the stage 
carlos  owner of stone renovation  was recommended to me by my cabinet refacer  in fact  my contractor used him for his granite and said he did excellent work   i concur completely  carlos gave us several quotes because we changed our mind about the granite and granite company we wanted to use  he was able to do 3 cm granite in a large kitchen and bar area with no seams using just two slabs of granite  the finishing work is done to perfection  carlos and his team did an excellent job of cutting out the sink opening and finishing the edges smoothly   so much better than the job the flippers had done on the bathroom marble in three bathrooms  the caulking around the kitchen sink  which is under mounted  is clean and barely noticeable  everyone on his team  including his wife liz  was very friendly and helpful   they aim to please  they listen to what you want  i would use stone renovations again   we are very pleased with the finished project 
this is a comment on jackis very negative and self centered review  this review is all about jacki  jacki  jacki    jacki  you most likely have never had to prepare a sermon  nor do you consider the  atmosphere  for receiving the word  most people in any congregation have had children and managed to bring them up going into their own area  you dont seem to be aware that some have trouble concentrating when there is noise or commotion  the pastor  no doubt  has spent many hours to prepare a message that will help his congregation  yet you are blind to anyones needs other than your own  it is obvious you are very young and entitled  as a visitor you do not support or serve this church  but you are self righteous about your  right  to do as you wish in a church that started without your help  input  or financial support  your attitude is rebellious and arrogant  so i am wondering where that fits into  church  life  where the goal is to become more christ like  humility and graciousness are virtues you should consider cultivating  i believe no one will take your review seriously because  selfishness  is written all over it  im wondering if your family agrees with what you wrote about  their  church 
love crossfit and love this place  i was looking for a way to build strength and stay fit as i get older  but i was completely bored with traditional gyms and fitness clubs  my husband and i watched the crossfit games on espn and were amazed at how fit everyone was  including the masters athletes  we stopped by crossfit mesa  and they explained how easy it was to get started and how you can scale workouts to whatever your fitness level and goals are   i was hooked from the first day  ive gotten better results in 6 months than i got from years of working out in a traditional gym  this isnt a place where people come in with headphones on and workout in isolation while staring at themselves in a mirror  the coaches and the members at crossfit mesa are a community of friends who work out intensely and celebrate each others successes  both inside and outside of crossfit  whether you know much about crossfit or not  you owe it to yourself to check it out 
when i am craving caribbean food this is my go to restaurant  the jerk chicken dinner meal is the best ive had here  another must try is the jerk chicken leg poutine  omg best of both worlds combined   keep in mind that this place has limited seating  its more of a take out place  there are a couple of tables for two people and some individual seats by the counter looking out the window    food 10  10  service 9 5  10
i agree with many of these negative posts regarding this practice  in my 50 plus years of seeing a doctor this office was the absolute worst  office staff is totally rude   disrespectful   does nothing but tell mistruths  dr lalani as far as i m concerned is a money hungry quack looking to take advantage of his patients monetarily not in the patients best interest  he did an ultrasound on my thyroid   told me i had an enlarged gland   wanted to perform a biopsy by inserting a needle in my throat area well 6 months later after refusing to have this procedure done  i just had an ultrasound done at another practice   no enlarged thyroid gland at all  do yourself a favor   steer clear of this office   doctor 
wow   what a great addition to the dc ranch area  cant say enough good things about the unique  one of a kind wine   food  we experienced the 5 glass wine tasting   all were fantastic  ordered the chopped salad   4 choice bruchetta   all were delicious  sarah our server was the best   also met the creator of all the wines colin  be sure to enroll in there wine club which consists of 4 tiers to choose from  well worth the cost all in all just a great experience   a welcome find to the area  sure to give postinos a wake up call 
love the ahi tuna salad and the french onion soup   great happy hour prices as well  
a surprisingly good place to get treats for vegetarians   we bought fresh buttercup squash ravoli there and they were the hit of our dinner party   also  they have really  good vegan italian sausage    most vegetarian sausage is terrible  this i would happily eat over and over again   and perfectly balanced ginger beer   didnt try the rootbeer that the other reviewer complains about but i would be surprised if its as bad as they claim  given how good everything else is here   nice guys too 
i went to the midnight diner with my boyfriend this morning for breakfast  weve past it a million times  but have never been before  we were seated immediately and had a friendly and attentive waitress   we both had chocolate milk  yummy and cold    i had corn beef hash  scrambled eggs  and a biscuit  all delicious  especially the biscuit   my bf created his own omelette and he really enjoyed that   the food was good  the menu is huge  the prices are extremely reasonable  and the service was great  im happy we finally tried midnight diner and i will definitely be back  next time maybe ill try the chicken and waffles   
first rate meal  marred only by the din of shouting diners  terrific fried watermelon  pumpkin dumplings  quail  a very good waiter and a pretty reasonable tab 
this was a very fine meal  well served  a superb tray of cold meats and garnishes  for three of us fine pork and clams  cornish hen  tuna  excellent desserts  a terrific bargain for a prix fixe of  30   and as a bonus a pleasant chat withe chef owner 
excellent apps  terrific pasta  three of us ate and drank  a bit  for  95  a very good price for a very tasty meal 
this is one of torontos restaurant bargains  everyday oysters at  1 per  we do 18 malpeques  with two glasses of wine and a shared chocolate torte  sit at the bar  and luxuriate inexpensively    when we want a full dinner  sorrel is also excellent  if noisy 
not sure why i waited 5 years to eat here living nearby the whole time but had a great lunch  pei wei spicy chicken w peapods carrots and white rice lunch size with a drink for less than  10  i like that i can actually tell im eating white meat chicken  very fresh and tasty but next time i will go for extra spicy option  although very flavorful the chicken was barely spicy  from what i saw at other tables  ill be coming back to try more 
if there was a way to give negative stars  i would  this place has been a constant disappointment in every way  they keep charging me the fees and the  manager  only comes in once a week and doesnt return phone calls  worst customer service of any local business i have experienced   my saga started over a year ago when i went in for the first massage  it was great  when your feeling relaxed and happy  then they hook you into a year long contract and thats where it gets messy   all of a sudden the therapist you started with no longer works there  come to find out the amount of turnover here is out of control and you can rarely get the same person twice  they are mostly straight out of massage school and have no experience  the ones that are any good leave for better places like elements   if you try to cancel  no such luck  wait it out  i waited  thought i cancelled but apparently it was just a freeze for 6 months  time goes by and i notice a charge on my card again  yey   no phone call from them to say hey we are charging again  no email  nothing  go to find the place  and they moved  now its officially cancelled  but i have to wait 30 days and another billing cycle to make that happen  so thats one more charge for a membership i have no interest in ever using    dont sign a contact here 
place is great  the food is excellent and the manager and owner were very nice gents when i spoke with them  i have hosted an event here and they were more than accommodating by offering some free bees for my guests  have been back on a couple other occasions and always a good time 
really damn good dogs and poutine    and beer  minimal  unassuming and unique decor that keeps ones focus on the view of the kitchen  hungrily awaiting foie gras  duck confit  and delicious legit gravy enthroned upon a bed of fat crispy fries  my favorite spot right now 
not really impressed  the food was expensive and not that great  the service was really good but the atmosphere is more of a yard  that happens to have a restaurant there  doubt that i will go again 
dolphin air provides great customer service and excellent prices for a  c service needs    i had a slow freon leak from a defective coil  and gabriel was able to get it replaced for much less than the other company i got a quote from     it is a pleasure to do business with a company like this 
great service  be in mesa forever you lay for what you get never had a problem in 11 years i dealing with the same workers 
good mexican food w traditional sonara selection the tortas are by far the best i ever had they are big and grilled like paninis they come with lays chips weird but its a college town they set up the inside like chipoltle so its easy for them drunk kiddies to get no pico on thee burro because like filisquirtos they always forget im sold on this place as of now stay gold 
first  i really love how the first review on f h fitness was posted by self proclaimed ceo of fair holdings dba f h fitness   if your goal is to support a local business that will be good for your community  please do yourself and the community a favor and stay far away from this place   if you hear the sales pitch that this is going to be a start of the art    market leading fitness facility   dont believe it   when you first sign up  it sounds like youre getting a killer deal with everything thats coming in phase 2  the problem is  hes been telling people phase 2 is in youre promises all these great new things will be coming down the road but nothing ever materializes  he has been promising that phase 2 is  coming soon  since june 2013  the most recent update for phase 2 that was shared on march 26th at 8 08 pm shows the same document he posted back in august 2013 and shows a random parcel of land that he does not own in addition to a generic floor plan  there is barely any equipment in this facility and not even quality training to get results with the limited equipment that is there  there were some great trainers and instructors for short periods of time but they never last because he never pays them  speaking from personal experience   see for yourself  on maricopa county court website by searching for case history fair holdings vs  industrial commission of arizona on behalf of john wilcox   there was a great zumba instructor last summer but she left because she was never paid  worse than that  the owner told people he was having an affair with her and had to let her go because he couldnt be in a relationship with someone that was working for him  he also started spreading lies to his members when john finally left after not being paid for over 5 weeks and receiving 3 or 4 bad checks due to insufficient funds  this places is full of one mans disaster caused by a tangled web of lies    do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place   the investors hes swindled is a whole other topic  if you happen to meet this guy and he starts asking you for money to invest in his state of the art facility  turn and run as fast as you can 
we had lunch here today and it was fabulous  the veggie calzone was amazing and plenty large to share  our son had the old school jerk chicken sandwich and loved it  we will definitely go back 
i have unfortunately had to replace my windshield many times and was going through safelite as the insurance suggested   the quality and service was horrible so when i ended up with a crack this week i decided to try out a new place  the service and friendliness from the receptionist to the tech at agp was great  the service was fast and worked well with my schedule   i hope i dont need a new windshield anytime soon but if i do ill be calling auto glass perfection again   thank you   
wow   i walked into ultimate dive  and i have rarely been so well treated by a shop staff   this was my first visit  they answered questions  showed me what i was looking for  and made my brief visit great   this will be a great place for dive instruction   knowledgeable  comfortable people   no upsell  no pressure  no negative vibes   just a great place to find good scuba equipment and advice 
awesome location  try to get a window seat   nice view of bellagio and cesars  food was great  service was better  would definitely come back 
just perfect if you are looking for some good comfort food  cooked stuff are tasty and delicious  while the greens fresh and crunchy  this place really doesnt need another review  it is lively even at 3pm on a weekday
another excellent choice at the cosmopolitan in vegas  we sampled several pastas and appetizers  the short rib agnolotti  pesto penne and the ravioli a were all great choices  the halibut and petit filet of beef were the best entrees  the chocolate cake with almond ice cream was the most popular dessert 
so my partner and i come to this place every time we want wings  1  theyre so cheap  2  the portions are huge and so far the only place that serves wings with fries  3  the best damn wings ive had in toronto   please tell me there are better ones out there somewhere   we love coming and will continue   my only complaint is the service isnt great  the waitresses tend to be chatty by the bar or with other patrons  while theyre all very nice and some go the extra mile to make us laugh  they could be a little more attentive to the tables theyre serving    other than that  100  would recommend 
i take my bbq seriously  and jbs did not disappoint   my husband and i had shared the rib tips  turnip and collard greens and the spicy red beans and rice   that last dish was authentic  which meant it had too much heat for me  but my husband loved it     jb was a very gracious host  giving us samples as we perused the menu before we ordered   he brought out tasters of the greens  which usually i would avoid  but they were delicious   another free sample was the okra  and heres a shocker  his okra was fantastic   not gelatinous in the least  but cooked perfectly in olive oil and seasoned well  a nice bite to the teeth  not soggy   jb made a convert out of me with regards to okra   jb also had us try the sweet potatoes  which were cooked perfectly  but a bit too sweet for me  and the red beans and rice   the man knows how to sell his food   the rib tips were to die for  nicely meaty and a great tasting sauce on them   jb sat and chatted with us for a few minutes  as he did with every customer who came in   we were there mid afternoon  long after the lunch rush  yet a constant stream of customers came in for food   this place isnt easy to find   its tucked into a corner of a tiny  two store front strip mall  next to a 7 11  but its worth looking around to find it   id give jbs five stars  but we did have a wait for our food   i know  i know   good food takes awhile  but i was hungry and needed to nosh then   there is really interesting artwork on the walls   take a minute and look   definite conversation starters there   next time i will explore the ribs  or the alligator  or the frog legs     we will definitely be back 
i loved this place  visited 10 13  the food was very good  lots of vegetarian options  read reviews after i ate there about funky smells and insect problems  glad i didnt before  probably would have been scared off  the restaurant was cute  looked and smelled clean  the server and assistant  pink hair  were awesome  he handled our party of six with ease and she kept our drinks full with a smile  best service ive had in a long time  thanks  well be back 
randalls has been around for a long time and the guys that work there are great  being a woman walking into a store full of gun loving men can be a little intimidating but ive always been made to feel welcome  their selection is on the smller side but quality  i traded in my last gun to them and they gave me more than i was expecting for it  they have good prices on ammo and always have the sizes i need in stock 
the price is worth what you can get  im not sure why the ratings are so low  the staff was nice and brief and refilled drinks in a timely manner  the selection of food is pretty good from sushi to seafood to chicken to steamed buns  overall pretty nice buffet for its price  only complaint is my table and silverware was dirty 
the service was polite and efficient  and the food cake fast  but i would recommend avoiding this place none the less  the food and drinks were below par for this casino  sad  
this is a great diversion from the strip  well worth searching out if you like pinball  machines of all vintages  all lovingly maintained and playable  for a reasonable price  a nice touch is the handwritten cards on the machines giving a bit of history  you can play the first machine to have electronic scoring  or the first to feature long hair and short skirts  loved it 
incredibly good  a short way into our burgers  longhorn burger for me with brisket  cole slaw and pickles  a mushroom and gruyere burger for david  we said  wow  these are possibly better than any place except umami burger  as the meal went on  we decided holsteins was giving even the venerable umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money  it was that good  i got the longhorn burger because i love bbq  even though i thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly  it wasnt  the brisket was sliced thin  and was a bit crisp   almost like a super delicious bacon  and best of all  the bbq sauce was not cloyingly sweet  a minor criticism  i thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant   maybe the quantities need adjusting  david was similarly pleased with his burger  every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms  one of us got fries and the other onion rings  both were good  service was first rate  we didnt try the shakes  we were very impressed 
this seriously is one of the best mexican restaurants in town  the food was delicious  my husband had the rico burrito and i had the chicken fajita burrito both were excellent  the chips and salsa was also really good  we loved the decor  service was great  it is a bit pricey though  overall  great experience 
recently remodeled in 2016  this hotel is simple and beautiful  nice size lobby and lounge area with ice cold water available for guests   check in was easy and quick  employees were very nice  rooms are clean but a little small but we loved the little kitchenette   pool is open till 11pm   the breakfast they provide in the morning is great  but we had to wait a little bit for the pancakes to be cooked   they do have a chobani greek yogurt station where you can add your own toppings 
i was looking up ms  wrights phone number for a policy inquiry and came across coventinas very negative yelp review of this state farm office  she obviously had a very difficult experience  but ive been fortunate that wright and her staff have always been courteous and extremely helpful whether the issue was a breakdown on the highway  needing a tow  or a simple inquiry on my coverage 
i see christa at platinum health   wellness and shes fantastic  i have chronic neck and back issues and through regular acupuncture and physiotherapy treatments  plus the odd light cupping  so cool    weve been able to minimize my discomfort  not only does christa obliterate all my knots with great focus and care  shes also really fun to be around  we love chatting about common interests and  before i know it  im feeling significantly better and leaving with a new movie recommendation or restaurant to try  i like the understated space  its cozy and theres always good music playing lightly in the background  very serene  i travel all the way from bloor and jarvis because im so sold on this spot  thank you 
we used them using grub hub   amazing food  service   delivery   our order actually arrived 30 minutes before estimated delivery time   food was hot   delicious   my husband made sure i remembered the name  so we can order again 
best manicure i have ever received    they are so quick and they do an amazing job  i will never get my nails done anywhere else  
i had a very bad experience at this restaurant  it started by me walking into the restaurant at 10 33am and we were 3 mins too late for breakfast  i was fine with this but really wanted breakfast  so we ordered two lunch menu meals  when we got home the fries were undercooked and they forgot one of the meals  i called the store back and explained to the manager darwin i didnt want a free gift card i wanted the meal i ordered and i didnt want to go back into my hot car to get it  he explained to me they were understaffed and too busy to bring my sandwich to me  the understaffed problem is probably why they forgot my sandwich  i also emailed the main company with no response  it seems like this company doesnt care much for their customers  also i guess it was my fault for expecting them to actually get the order right but this was handled incorrectly after the fact 
the wine here is amazing  my boyfriend and i did the red wine tasting and took home a couple bottles  well worth a visit  staff is knowledgeable and friendly 
this place was good but wasnt great  the service we received was a star but the food was about a 2 star    crab cakes 4  5 stars moist and lots of crab meat but was kinda lacking flavor    salad 3  5 stars  the dressing was good but some of my lettuce and greens werent fresh and crisp   tacos 2  5  the slaw was kinda sour to taste but the meat was ok
my friend and i came here because my old foot massage place was closed and boy it was a great thing it was  zen is amazing  her and i did the  20 1 hour foot massage and it was so much more than what we anticipated   it started off with us soaking out feet in the warm water while they massaged our heads for about 10mins  then  they massaged neck and shoulders for another 5 10mins and arms too  that followed with a 30min foot massage  we were then pleasantly surprised with them asking us to turn over and giving us a full body massage that was to die for  i could not believe all of that for  20  my friend and i walked out paying  20 and tipped them  10 each for such an amazing job and wonderful experience  we will be coming back every 2 weeks 
me and my mother come here all the time  took us a while to find a shop like this  everyone at this shop is talented  friendly and professional  if you tell them what you want they do exactly that  my   willy are both awesome at shaping nails 
yea  just wow   their peameal bacon sandwich was amazing      i dont know how else to describe it   i love this spot  and the owner is so down to earth   he doesnt come off like you are bothering him  even though his spot is so popular and so busy   come by and check this little spot out 
i would come to buy again   dont come here to expect an amazing atmosphere nor professionally groomed salespeople   come to get a decent deal on a television   david  my salesperson  was helpful without being pushy     there was another salesperson in the room   hed make a biker blush with such profane language he was using clearly out loud   he went on for a bit before someone reminded him theres a couple of customers in the store   he appeared to not care   if he had been my salesperson  id have told him how unimpressed i was and walked out   i cant believe he is allowed to work there     anyway  i didnt let him spoil my time shopping   though i wasnt impressed with the place and environment  it was good enough to see their selection  make a choice  and get a better price than retail   i dont know whether they sell brand new televisions   looks like theyre selling customer returns which were non defective and  or refurbs   so  one should not expect to pay full retail   my television looks and functions like new   but it wasnt brand new and manufacturers warranty didnt come with it   my sales guy  david  was fine   id even seek him out if i returned   i hope they do something with that sales guy with poor manners   tell him to act more like you should as an employee of a business or be gone 
this chapel doesnt look all extravagant from the outside  but it is absolutely perfect for your wedding day  my husband and i just married here and chose this place because we wanted a traditional experience for us although it was just going to be the 2 of us  i liked what i saw from watching other peoples big day    they treated us great  the cordinator genuinely makes you feel like they are celebrating with you   it was perfect  the photographer is excellent  the posed pictures are the best so purchase ahead or be ready to spend more the day of   i didnt give it 5 stars due to the person showing us the pictures   he was a little rude  i understand there are other weddings but he was rushing us to choose the pictures we wanted  i wanted to change one of my choices to another  but he intimidated me into doing so      other than that  this place was on point 
horrible  beware    dont pay with card for anything  they will claim its not working and then put a charge of 330  thank god my bank notified me right away 
scarlett is the best stylist in the valley hands down  i am so happy my mom found her a couple years ago  her professionalism and talent keep me coming back for more  not many stylists can handle my thick curly hair  and what she does with color is incredible  she is truly passionate about her job   a visionary when it comes to her craft    love this girl  
ive been to this comic book shop twice now  and both times  i have felt really uncomfortable and unwelcome  each time i go in  i never get greeted   i get ignored  the men who walk in the door are immediately greeted and asked if they can be helped  ive never had one of the crew members say anything to me first  ive always had to go and ask them for help  and even then  they are less than enthusiastic to help me    the thing is  ive talked to other women who have gone to this store  some of them big comic collectors  and they all feel the same way  why the cold shoulder toward females  there are other comic book stores in oakville with bigger collections and friendly employees  and ill be taking my business there 
went here last minute and unfortunately as always food was just ok  my boyfriend ordered a 2 meat combo with ribs and brisket  i ordered hotlink and ribs  the hotlink was burned and the brisket was very dry  but the potato salad  spicy mac and cheese and corn bread was good 
cody campbell at 1st rate home mortgage was extremely helpful in our recent refi  he was available to answer questions at all times of the day and also made recommendations that helped use secure more favorable terms  i would definitely recommend 1st rate home mortgage 
the food is average while the decor is contemporary  the main selling point of this place are the multiple flat screen that play sports games and the various selection of alcohol at their bar  service is pretty good and friendly  the lunch menu is available from 11 00a m  5 00 p m  every day  happy hour menu with almost 1  2 price appetizers are available monday through friday from 3 00p m to 6 00p m  the price is excellent where you can get a whole pizza for approximately  6 00 or  7 00  a great deal 
after trying a few pediatric dentists my business partner recommended dr  nett  i cannot say enough good things about both doctors and their entire staff  weve been coming for almost 10 years for both dentistry and orthodontics  when the kids cant wait to come back you know you found a great dentist  i highly recommend this business 
cozy clean and nice  the taro addict was really good  also tried the oreo it was delish  a great alternative to a coffee shop where you can chill and get some school work done or whatever you do 
the worst customer service i have ever dealt with in the airline industry  they have absolutely no contingency plans if an airplane has to be grounded  myself and several dozen others had to be left overnight at a best western because our plane had mechanical trouble  and never once did anyone consider using any of the other empty  ready to go and exactly similar airplanes at the airport we were grounded at  i called their service department to see if they were going to do anything to compensate us for the poor service  and the third person i was forwarded to told us that it wasnt their responsibility to compensate or make things right   it was the airports responsibility  i had to hang up immediately as talking to another one of their brainless representatives   the only saving grace is that the pilots and flight attentant on our grounded flight were fantastic people and made the best of a poor situation  but i lost a day off my incredibly tight schedule and aas customer service didnt blink an eye  a few weeks later they sent me some frequent flyer miles on an account that i dont even know how to access  i doubt ill be using them  or intentionally flying on american ever again 
the broth is really good  its probably one of the best in montreal  sadly  the quality of their meat was well below average  the beef was starchy  dry and just tasted like really old frozen meat  i would not return due to the quality of their meat  the broth is delicious but it doesnt make up for their poor quality meat  3 stars 
the best korean chicken place in montreal  we got a bit of everything  my favourite was the garlic teriyaki chicken wings  we also got the order of 18pieces half korean sweet chilli and half original fried  the 18 pieces came with side of fries   unlimited refill coleslaw  we also had the yaki udon  which is on the sweeter side but i thought was very tasty and so did my boyfriend  we had left overs because we ordered so much but glad we did so we can also have it at home again later    we will be returning very soon as if is very tasty  also if u get take out  there is a korean market right beside the restaurant so you can stop by there and pick up traditional ready made side dishes to go with your chicken  there is free parking in front of the restaurant  street  for an hour max    they also deliver on just eat if you live within the vicinity
theres always a line here if u come during breakfast and lunch hours  usual wait is roughly 20 30 mins if youre lucky  all the dishes are well presented  if you have a vip card and pay cash  u get 10  off  they have a variety of dim sum dishes including really nice presented ones  its good if youre bringing family here as the presentation is really nice  1 star off because the service is quite poor  its hard to get their attention and most of the employees do not speak english  i asked for mayonnaise and not one person in the entire restaurant knew what mayonnaise was  another star off because itll be hard for people who arent chinese to order and understand  communicate  so maybe download a translating app before u go lol
ordered on uber eats  food was good   we got the sandwiches but after a while we felt really bad and had stomach aches 
pros  easy to spot  clean  decor is pretty nice   cons  terribly slow service and meh beer    its basically a place to dive into when you cant find anything better or are too tired to make it to a better place 
i heard really good things about this place but i tried to go there twice  the first time they said were opened but closed and told us to come back at 5pm  we went to eat pho instead because we were hungry and could not wait  the pho store beside them is really good     the next day we tried going again and they were closed  we came at 5 30pm  the sign said it opened and to come back at 5pm  it was 5 30pm and no one was there  they said online they were opened  if you go  make sure you call them and see if they are opened because their times listed online are wrong  waste if our time 
omg    i thought pita land was good until i tried this  the portions are ginormous and its amazing and delicious  it is 100x better than pita land  would get this all the time if it wasnt so far 
been coming to congee wong for over 10 years now with my family  the congee is the best ive had tasted so far in toronto  i always get their liver congee  the liver is so soft  it melts in ur mouth  they also have lobster and crab chinese dishes if you have family dinners here which is nice  also at a cheap price  the portion of the food here is enormous and would definitely feed an entire family  its always good value here and we always leave with leftover take out as well 
the oysters here are fresh and delicious  come early to avoid disappointment    my favourite dish is their fish tacos 
not the best tea place but it opens until very late so if you crave bbt late night then it isnt too bad    but dont expect cha time  coco or gong cha quality  
ihop just opened  great service even for being open for a week   food was as we expected and the service was great 
gagan is a very good restaurant to visit   owner and other members are professional and curtious  delicious food and nice ambience 
i love starbucks    what i dont love is waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru for my  15 order to be wrong and given to me with an eye roll and poor attitude    dont go to this location  
great deal for  20 to get your car looking brand new  however do not go when they are busy  they will skip things like your mirrors and spots on the windows  staff are very friendly 
i love bringing my 5 year old here  getting his haircut is always torture but the girls here are always amazing with him   great staff and clean all around  
while the jazz was incredible  the food was subpar  we had the salmon lasagna  which was underwhelming  extremely heavy  but not very flavorful  we also had the tuna tartare which was very good  as well as the crepe which again was very heavy but not very flavorful  sitting outside was amazing  the band was lovely and almost made up for the bland food 
i love that they have great vegetarian options and a section dedicated for that on their menu  the edamame dim sum was my favorite  was surprised that it was tastier than i thought it would be  the only downside though is the portions felt a little small  two plates of dim sums and one main course of noodles later  we found ourselves trying to find another place to get more food    i would still go back for the noodles though 
first time at this restaurant   very impressed   fast friendly service   very nice feel to the place  fell in love with the salsa they served with chips as soon as we arrived had pollo loco  quite tasty   grilled onions on top were extremely delicious   yum  everything very fresh   healthy portions  prices very reasonable  will come back for more 
i ordered from here using uber eats because it has such a large variety for vegetarians  and i was so pleasantly surprised  the sampler is pretty big  and im eating leftovers for breakfast as i type     i am looking forward to visiting the actual location since all of the other reviews cite how friendly the owners are    i got the sampler with chickpeas  lentils  string beans  and beets  i loved them all  i liked the lentils a little better than the chickpeas  but i would still choose to eat them any day of the week  also  who needs utensils when you have injera  if youve never had it  its a flat bread made from teff  a naturally gluten free grain  if you have any real issues with gluten  you should still order the  pure injera  which looks to be made only with teff  so i assume their normal injera may have some wheat or something  anyway  its delightfully spongy and sour like sourdough    you should certainly check this spot out 
went inside and ordered a double jack combo and several other items to go   got home and found there was only one burger patty in the double jack   since we live about five miles from the restaurant  it wasnt worth the drive back   it was probably an accident but if you wanted to rip off a customer  this would be an easy way to do it   there are plenty of other burger joints in surprise so i dont need jack in the box anymore 
last night we  10 people  had a terrific experience at surprise olive garden  great food  great service  great fun   we are 5 couples  2 live here full time  2 are  snowbirds  and 1 is visiting from washington  we made reservations and were promptly seated in a small alcove off the main room  very conformable  amber g   our server  was right there and asked if we were ready to order drinks  which we did   we tend to joke around a lot and give the servers a hard time and amber was right there with us the whole night  she has a sparkling personality and we enjoyed interacting with her  i think she was rewarded well in the end   oh by the way  the food was terrefic also   several of us enjoyed their never ending classics  while the ladies ordered off the regular menu  talking later  in the parking lot  we all agreed the food was excellent   i cant emagine how this evening could have been any better 
i wish i could give them for 0 star  we paid time share  8000 00 for nothing all sales people lie to us   they promise you everthing before you paid the money  after words  there is nothing stay away from those sales peole  geo holiday has poor business 
my boyfriend and i went there 2 weeks ago for breakfast because hes not a really big fan of cora and we wanted somewhere close    delicious   i was not disappointed   they gave us a table near the kitchen and we could see the chefs making our food    staff was really friendly  smoothies were good and my breakfast was yummy and filling   inexpensive and totally worth the stop 
derek the barber showed outstanding character and gave me great service even tho i was a walkin and the last client  best cut so far 
fast cheap food  not great  not bad but there 
i wish i could give a 0 star instead    as a first timer  i requested a regular manicure pedicure and my pedi lasted just about 9 mins for thats all she included in a regular pedi  she says  2 mins massage  no scrubbing of dead skin  didnt agree to change the shape of my nails during filing and got me going with the nail paint in a phew  i wonder why even keep that kind of pedicure on your menu if thats the kind of justice that youve to do to  22  will never go and recommend this place 
ive usually fared about average when it comes to food at any hard rock ive ever been to  so i wasnt waiting for high dollar cuisine  i ordered the  rockin wings  and boy were they every bit of that name  they had a good punch to them and were cooked to perfection    i make some great wings at home which i will never divulge what goes on them   lol   but these were so good  my wife even compared them to the ones from home and she never does that  i was definitely impressed and would love to order a larger size the next time im in town  the ambiance of sitting on the patio by the strip is a definite must if youre wiling to brave the vegas breeze at night or the heat during the day  the nightlife is the best because of everything thats going on down below 
this is a review for breakfast   i did give this place a few shots before i write this review but it has not been improved during my visit   first time i tried breakfast bento and steak   eggs  tragic   even neighborhood diner did it better   the bento itself was horrible displayed   they did not even place the rice to be presentable for the price that they charge   salmon was undercooked and those so called  hand selected fruits  were hard as rock and tasteless  onsen egg was broken at the time of serving too   steak was dry and tasteless   i was rather surprised they could not even get the simple scramble egg right  i had better breakfast eggs on airplane than here   during my other visit  i tried mandarin breakfast which consists of egg white omelet  same tasteless fruits and the best part to my breakfast was their butter   asked for juice refill    sorry we ran out  at 1030am     forgot my tea order and the table was dirty  hair attached on the table  guess they didnt mop it well    see picture    service from servers were spotty but the service manager seemed like a nice guy but i would certainly avoid coming here for breakfast as the food and service were not up to my expectations 
one of the decent place to eat italian food inside venetian  palazzo complex   fast  prompt service and waiter is attentive   price is definitely reasonable for vegas standard   i like my carbonara pasta alot   esp with the sweet pea and bacon   the bacon taste actually infused within the pasta so makes it taste so delicious   the waiter was very nice where he asks if any of us were allergic to bacon  now thats what i called good service   we were also given dinner portion for the price of lunch   what a lucky day   tip   lunch portion is a better choice and if going there for dinner  order 1 main course is enough for 2 people to share 
best staff at this location  very friendly and very keen to a customers needs  there drive through is slow though  they are extremely busy in the morning though 
my favorite local spot  food is great  awesome place for hanging out with friends and family  the prices are reasonable  opens until 1am 
words can not express how calming the atmosphere is  how friendly the staff is and how delicious the food is  one of the owners  i assume  saw me looking at the wall of famous vegans and engaged in such an inspirational conversation about how  being a vegan is sooooo healthy  she was not pushy  or preachy  very sincere and passionate  this is my go to spot and im not even vegan 
one of the first things i did when moving to edinburgh i highly recommending climbing arthurs seat  dont be put off by the walk  its not as difficult as it looks and the views are worth it 
working with scott was a delight  he came to the house  brought a plethora of samples  explained each type of flooring based on my needs  he is professional and i would highly recommend him for any flooring need anyone could have 
this restaurant is big and busy  i have to say for a place so busy you have to wonder why is it cash only    the rendang beef was ok  nice flavours but the beef was very dry and shredded ive had better rendang at soos and mathahari where they have really malaysian food   and yes when i paid if took a long time to get change  go figure    you just have to go to soos the chef is brilliant 
dft did a great job delivering a ping pong table from a store to my home  they were punctual  friendly and professional  rich and his son were very pleasant and went out of their way to satisfy 
ive never actually been here but i was trying to schedule a bachelorette spa day for 4 girls  i had a few questions so i used the websites  contact us  form and it didnt work  form has reached the maximum amount of submissions    then i tried to email them  i like to keep things in writing  and their email was no longer in service  finally i called and was able to speak to i think the owner who was nice and after a quick discussion with the girls we were ready to book  i called back and was told by someone else we could not do the bridal package because they dont have anyone to do nails because of a vacation  this was booking 4 weeks out   she said we could book other random services and i responded by saying we wanted the package because it was several services for a good price  she responded by telling me to just find another service the same price  not the point   needless to say we booked elsewhere 
maybe i got too hyped up about this place but i have to say that i dont see they hype that everyone is talking about   it was a typical las vegas buffet 
delivery was on time and correct  the volcano roll is to die for it was still warm when delivered  overall great experience 
wish i could talk about the hypothetical great car we bought from kayser  but we never made it that far  i really cant stand most car dealderships  id love to find one that truly seems to understand not only what i need  but that a car is a major investment for me and they need to treat it as such   anyway  i digress     my husband and i stopped in to check out a new suv  test drove it  liked it  yadda yadda  so we put it on our short list  talked to two employees and told them we would be back the next day  they told us that the car was close to going to auction  but promised many times that they would hold it for us until we came back the next day  shook hands and went on our merry way   next day  we decided to purchase the car and went back to kayser to start the process  when we got there  they told us they had sent the car to auction already  im sorry  what   i mean  i know we hadnt purchased it yet  but we spoke to both a salesman and a manager only one day prior  then when my husband expressed his disappointment  their only response was to back pedal about what they promised and tell my husband that he was just feeling guilty for not  pulling the trigger  sooner  wow  its one thing to break a deal  but to also insult our judgement when making a big  and expensive  decision    i hope those employees were not a reflection of the entire company  but it was more than enough to lose our business  we went to the dealership across the street and bought the same car with little hassle 
holy moly  how did i go years without making this place a part of my life     best ice cream in town  there  i said it  also they were doing something where they poured cheese on a bag of spicy cheetos  i need to learn more about that   
not impressed  if you get a look when its not packed    really quite a homely place  the menus looked like theyve been soaked down and poorly dried  our waitress couldnt have made it clearer that she resented our presence  although she was obviously not busy  the food was purely mediocre  masquerading as gourmet  theres good reason this place felt abandoned  on a saturday night  perhaps its better for a show    but there are too many decent places to eat in this town to ever come back here for a bite 
great service  food  atmosphere  a lot of fun  our kids loved it  kids menu is a good deal a lot of food for the money
the people are nice and the service isnt bad  but ive eaten here twice and the first time i got the athens wrap and ended up throwing it away  it tasted terrible     the second time i dont remember what i got but i remember telling myself i was never going to eat there unless i had too  so basically the food isnt that great and its also expensive 
i visit phoenix fairly often   we decided to check out this place at the recommendation of a friend on a friday night at around 6pm  first thing we noticed was the whole walking directly into a storefront thing  okay cool  but no one around to guide newbies  it looked like an event was being set up next to the store section  great music drew us into a fairly open and empty room with amps and great 80s music  we did not see anywhere to order apps or drinks  so we walked to the outside  where it seemed the majority of the patrons were  one member of our party went to the circular bar in the center to get 3 drinks  it took over 20 minutes for him to return  another member of our party went to the food ordering stand thing  again  over 20 minutes for bacon mac muffins and cheese dip   our first 3 drinks came to over  40 without food added on  i went to get another round for our group  spent another 20  minutes being ignored by the bartender  until finally he turned to me and asked if i was with the wedding party  i had no idea there was a wedding party  no signage  nobody giving out that information  i replied no  and was told that there was another bar inside of the building that would give me better service   all after sitting for 20  minutes  watching him drop his juice squeezer on the floor and pick it up without washing it  and being pretty disappointed by how other peoples orders were being taken before mine when i had been standing there much longer  my party had gotten their appetizers while i was gone waiting for this guy  i had a cold muffin and a few scoops of cold cheese dip  then  with one muffin left in the basket  an employee picked up the basket   sticking his thumb in the muffin   and asked if we were finished as he did not even wait for a response and turned away with it  you can bet i wont be going here again  too bad the music was good 
went for dinner tonight and it was delicious  got the mahi tacos and a swanky steak taco  they were both phenominal  service was fast and everyone was friendly and helped explain everything since it was our first time there  house salsa was good  also tried the guacamole  corn salsa  and there pineapple habanero salsa which were all pretty good    my wife had the gringo chicken tacos which were decent  the fried plantains were by far the best part of the meal  would definily go back

food is fresh and tasty  great price for soup and salad  i had a chowder and it was full of fish  crabmeat  very good value and cheap 
peking duck kitchen obviously is famous for peking duck  it makes me wanna try this place is because their other dishes are above average based on the yelpers reviews    service is very friendly  i agree with other reviewers that the staff showed their eagerness to please customers  the service was efficient    we ordered peking duck two way  indeed there were 4 dishes  and added  4 99 for the duck bone soup  i was surprised the soup came sort of immediately  the soup was the only disappointment of the whole night  i would not pay extra for the soup or should try other ways to cook the bone    i could see the chef was shredding the duck skin from the  open concept  kitchen window  the duck was freshly made and i could see steam coming out from the duck  first dish was a few pieces of duck skin from the fattest part of the duck with sugar  it was crispy and sort of  melt in your mouth   it was very delicious    the second dish was the duck skin and meat for the flour wraps  i love the duck was not overly fat and the skin was very crispy  the flour wrap was very thin to give you full enjoyment of the duck itself    the third dish was stir fry duck meat with veggies with lettuce wraps  at first i saw the portion was smaller than i had in other places  yet we ended up couldnt finish all the meat with the lettuce provided    we also ordered dry stir fried pork intestine and shrimp with baby cabbage based on my fellow yelper jennifer ks recommendations    i am big fan of spicy food and pork intestines  this dish was very delicious  however  it was very spicy and you have to make sure you can bear that hotness  the pork intestine portion was generous and i enjoyed every bite of it    shrimp with baby cabbage was a big surprise  the dish was gigantic  the presentation was like a piece of art  the pumpkin soup was delicious with baby cabbage    i think other than the duck bone soup was a regret  i enjoy the meal very much  i will definitely go back for more peking duck  
after the ikea recall we went there to look for a new dresser for our daughters room  we found the perfect piece  after measuring it we figured it would fit in our trunk but it didnt  the owners were so nice that they offered to drop it off since we live a couple minutes from their house   thank you so much  not only you have great items to choose from but amazing customer service as well

this is my favourite thing about las vegas  never fails to entertain 
im originally from ny so i was pretty excited to hear that halal guys were opening a store close to where i lived  i went the day after it opened  around 5 30pm  and the lines were still out the door  it took abt  20min to get from where we stood in line to ordering our food  an employee was handing out stickers    there are apparently 2 sizes you can order if you get the platter  i ordered the large    9  combo platter  which is the equivalent to the ny one size only platter  half of the platter consisted of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and the other half was rice and meat  but more rice than meat  so  it was pretty disappointing for them to skimp out on food  usually  lettuce is only supposed to fill 1  4 of the container  i heard from several friends that it seemed healthier  not in a good way  bc there wasnt a nice layer of oil covering the bottom once you ate the whole thing  the meat wasnt as flavorful   maybe the taste will improve in some weeks or so   there were about 7 or 8 two seater tables inside and  2 four seater tables outside  it was a battle to grab a table and then keep it   employees and customers alike gave us so much heat it felt pretty uncomfortable    theres a parking lot  however  dutch bros is right next to this food plaza and they currently have a one way drive through that some cars actually confused as another entrance into the halal guys parking lot and you can imagine there were a lot of angry drivers and loud honking  so be careful that the parking lot entrance youre entering is the right one    overall  im glad i can indulge in halal food whnever i crave it  so i cant complain too much 
6 30 on a saturday night   the place was  40  full  it was fancier than i thought it would be   people were wearing business casual  smart and dresses  i felt underdressed in my t shirt and jean shorts   my friends and i ordered 3 dishes to share  buffalo carpaccio  stetson chopped salad and mushroom pan fry  they were all about   12 15  the stetson salad was the best dish by far  it looked pretty  all of the ingredients lined up  colorful   there was some crunch to it  i would definitely order the salad again   for a bunch of soft spoken girls  we were unable to hear each other over the loud chatter at cowboy ciao  as the night went on  the restaurant was completely full by 8pm 
i had a wonderful experience getting a massage from nicole  she was very professional and skilled at what she does  i walked out feeling like a brand new person  i would highly recommend her to anyone 
on 6  11  16 i bought a  groupon for the ice cream cake so i ordered the cookie dough blizarrd cake from dairy queen on s maryland pkwy las vegas but when i picked up the cake it looked nothing like the picture they have on website  looked like a child decorated it also no cookie dough inside the cake  i asked for manager they said no one avail until 6  16  i called and left my phone number for a return call but of course that didnt happen  called them on 6  14 i got a so called manager by the name of q he told me on the phone to return the cake and he will refund my money when i got there on 6  14 at 615pm i asked for q but no one answerd there was 2 guys and 1 girl behind the counter so 1 of them said since i bought groupon cant refund my money only the difference  i said that isnt what you told me on the phone  i want my money back he said he cant so i asked for the owner the guy said he my dad  ok well get ur dad on the phone  he refused and walked to the back never came back up front the other guy was very rude said im your not getting your damn money back and to take the cake with me and just laughed  i said then i want the difference he asked for the debit card because he wasnt allowed to give me cash but then throws my debit card and cash on me and walked away saying i aint dealing with this shit  how do you allow ur employees to treat ur customers like this  they wouldnt give me the owners name  ive never been treated this way  they lack customer service and no empathy  how do you allow your employees to curse at your customers  im still in shock from the way i was treated and just how the so called manager just walked to the back and didnt handle the situation  very unprofessional 
went in for a simple hour or so alignment for my z  i had been noticing the steering wheel shaking a little bit  an hour later the tech comes to the front and tells me that my cars bushings are broken and that i need new control arms  claims the  control arms are broken and wouldnt hold the alignment   i get handed an invoice for  1200 and am told that i need to order the new bushings for replacement  thankfully i have extended warranty thru nissan and they were able to diagnose the car and ensure me that my control arms are perfect and theres nothing wrong with the car other then some inner tire wear thats causing the shaking  i would not recommend buddys alignment to anyone  even if its only  80  most shops should learn to help people rather then try and squeeze money out of them  i have no respect for shops that try and replace parts that arent broken and then charge a service fee of  35 when they didnt even work on the car and wasted my time 
reading through all the reviews from here  i noticed a lot of people gave this place fairly low ratings  despite that  i am giving this place 4 stars because the banh mi there was fresh and it was packed nicely with lots of veggies and meat  i also ordered a side of honeydew boba slush  which was okay    i do love the decor of the place  very bright and modern with a clean atmosphere  this place is great for a quick lunch or a to go lunch 
this used to be so clean  now its dirty the bathrooms smell and the emergency alarm in the childs play area has been off three times when ive been there with my grand kids or going back  and yes most times they get the order wrong   too bad  it has such a nice play area  havent noticed the manager in the vest around as often as he used to and can sure tell the difference 
we were staying at a local hotel and looking for a place where we could dine outside on the patio with our golden retriever   a friend who lives nearby told us about cornish pasty  we had no idea what a pasty was but looking at the menu online and it looked interesting  we were not disappointed  both of our pasties were superb  we will be back in az next week and plan on dining here again  wish they had these in southern california 
very solid fbo  they were very diligent about making sure my dry cleaning was delivered on time  gave me a crew car to run my errands  they have a  decent cafe if you need a meal  doesnt open till 8am   and crew rest area has a 2 private rooms if you need to get some sleep  and there is a shuttle to take you to and from your hotel  competent staff  clean   well maintained facility  and they go the extra mile to make crew life easy  keep up the good work 
service is bad  bad  bad  although the food is okay portion  the staff there brings this rating way down    i was there during a lunch rush  although it wasnt completely slammed  a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how she is f       working     crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock    aside from this little mishap   you cant get seated  order you meal  get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all  i almost left exact change when i got my bill  but decided tip lite anyway    food is full of grease  just about everything on their lunch menu is fried  what a disappointment    i wont be back and i hope for the sake of this place they will consider hiring staff with some customer service skills    oh and wtf  fox news is the only news network they show 
i went to this restaurant on a date night with my husband  as soon as you walk in the entrance candle smells wonderful  the service is outstanding  our waitress was quick  attentive and overall lovely  we started with 2 bloody ceasers and some oysters  the drinks were delicious and strong  the oysters were so fresh and out of this world  they were also perfectly shucked i might add  my husband ordered a glass of red wine  i forget the name but it was a cabernet and was really fantastic  i had a marmalade margarita again delicious    the main dishes of lobster fettuccini and scallops with a side of roasted potatoes were perfection  for desert we had a chocolate espresso mouse and i was actually so full  i could not finish it  the few bites i had were delicious  i strongly recommend and shall be returning 
what a ripoff   they had a special events menu with burgers over  12   fries were undercooked   shakes 1  3 whipped cream without the extra on the side you always get   waitress tried to hurry us out to get more people in to rip off   never again 
i made a special trip up to pittsburgh to see this little guy and it was worth it  im a huge rubber duck aficionado  ive been collecting rubber ducks for years and years now and have accumulated a collection of over 200 in rubber ducks alone  havent even attempted to count the other duck paraphernalia ive acquired over the years   when i heard about the rubber duck project by florentijn hofman and saw the sculpture in sydney  hong kong  and beijing this year in the news  i fell in love with this rubber duck  i was beyond ecstatic when i heard it was coming to the us and even more excited when i heard it would be making its us debut on the east coast  just 4 hours from where i live     the rubber duck knows no frontiers  it doesnt discriminate people and doesnt have a political connotation   hence why when i was there  so were hundreds of people  young and old  female and male  of all races  gathered to see this majestic  whimsical sculpture  the rubber duck is the most charming and delightful friend youll meet  it doesnt even have to talk for you to smile  no joke  i sat there and gazed at the duck for 30 minutes and just smiled at its simplicity and playfully quaint nature    after taking dozens of photos  i purchased three things at the official merchandise stand   a poster  a replica  and a sticker  i would have bought everything but only had  20 in cash with me at the time   after browsing online at the pittsburgh cultural trust website  i purchased a t shirt  cap  and pin   essentially every available merchandise  no regrets though  these are collectibles worth collecting  especially for me  one of the biggest rubber duck fans out there     rubber duck  you are definitely the one and you made pittsburgh so much fun 
what is there not to like about this place  its close to the strip but far enough away to avoid the noise and congestion  the staff is great especially i believe her name was noel  and sorry in advance if i got it wrong  who has a baby  was obviously a bit stessed out at having to be at work when she wanted to be with her baby but still was there with a smile and took care of evertything we asked of her promptly and enthusiastically  we own a timeshare in florida have been to one in hawaii and this place is the best yet  one criticism       the pool and hot tub should be closed after say 1 a m  there were people making a lot of noise at the pool two mornings while we were there at around 4 a m  when most  if not all  guest are sleeping  this imo is unacceptable 
i am an avid yelper  i have to yelp everything  period  i recently moved to toronto and after passing countless second cups and starbucks  i craved something a little more flavorful  personal  and less commercial  jimmys coffee easily satisfied this craving  i ordered a soy latte and the nuttiness of the espresso plus the nutty soy milk was perfection  i am a little perturbed in general of the  50 cent charge of soy milk because really how much more does it cost  ummm   its about the same price to buy a carton of milk vs  a carton of soy  but  everybody else does it so i cant let it affect my review of the place    i also parked it in the back room in one of the cozy sitting chairs and didnt move for maybe 4 hours  the jimmys staff knows how to choose some good tunes too    thanks for the great cup of coffee 
we had an amazing dinner for my husband bday on sunday  jones tidy was our server and his knowledge  recommendations  friendly attitude and smile made it a great experience  we will be back  
i love this location and i am glad it is close to my home  the service is always great and the food fresh and tasty  the friendly staff takes their job seriously and know how to please their customers 
nice theater with reclining seats  also since this theater is not even a year old its not prone to crowds   while i like this  not being crowed and having my pick of the best seats  i do want them to stay in business so go check them out especially since the first films of the day are always  5 
natural products and great smells to be found inside the body shop  this location meets my needs since its close by my home  i think that things are changing because the staff is great any they are always busy merchandising  i am very glad that they are in the paradise valley mall stop by and give them your business 
choose your crust   white  wheat or gluten free   sauce  cheese  dairy or dairy free  and as many fresh toppings as you like and for  8 95  yes please  i like this concept you cannot phone in your order but you can order to go  these are thin crust pizzas but they are tasty  thank you my pie for opening up near my home 
always friendly and no huge issues  ive always gone to this location because i didnt know about the dobson location at first  i will be switching to that one though when we get insurance again  only due to convenience 
i love this place  ive known about the wok since about 06 when i was big into the local band scene  i had some friends work there so id pop in from mesa to visit and to get the awesome kiwi strawberry chicken and crab puffs  those are probably the best things on the menu  hands down  the bar is super cool  but ive only been there once since they opened it  jamie  the owner  is probably the raddest dude ever  which makes me love this place even more 
oooh i love the garlic knots  this place introduced me to them and im hooked  and so cheap for a big portion  ive only had their calzones  because you get a huge meal for a decent price  theyre so good  all the stuffing and melted cheese   mmmmm  only thing i had an issue with is how they run things during lunch  why cant they have a server just like for dinner  very confusing and quite silly 
dirty room  the staff were very sweet and offered us another room but that was was just as dirty  the bed was uncomfortable and the ac was noisy   never again 
the  oysters   still dreaming of the oysters    briny  still in their juices  not too big  not too small  not fishy at all   came for happy hour and tried these little beauties   some of the best  if not best  ive ever had   you think it wouldnt be hard to get oysters right  but it is   1  2 off wine and beer for happy hour   and they have a good selection of both 
ive been to the oconnor location of eggsmart once  but have been to other locations as well  theyre a great chain of restaurants that serve good food for not a lot of money  they serve only breakfast type items  but thats okay with me   service is a little weird  i dont think the waiters have specific tables  but it seems to work for them    the only downside to eggsmart is that theyre only open till 3pm  so you cant go there for dinner 
i became a customer of mail boxes etc  now called the ups store  in 1980 at their store  2 location  they are a franchise operation and i get it that every owner will have their own style  at the store i originally went to the service was above and beyond  including calling me at home if i received an urgent looking letter and even bringing my mail to my home once when i was too sick to get out of bed   now its almost 2018 and good customer service is rare  and store  4910 is my nearest ups store  ive been going there for about 10 years and i dont think ive ever seen the same employee twice  i have no idea who the owner is and no one there has any idea who i am   i have owned small businesses and i fully understand the need to make a profit but what this store tries to get away with should be against the law   two examples   i wanted to send a book to a relative one saturday  i told the deer in the headlights kid there was no rush  since it was only a  10 book just send it the cheapest way  he said the cheapest way would be  256   i said i didnt want him to fly there and hand deliver it  there must be something cheaper  he said no  because of the holiday    i was beyond belief by this point but i bit and asked him  um   what holiday     mothers day  he replied   but mothers day is on sunday and ups wont be here to pick up until monday  i tried to explain  he was adamant  it would be  256 to send the book   i went to the post office   the nail in the coffin was last week  i wanted to return an item to amazon using a prepaid label but i had thrown away the box  the item was a broken cheap plastic file box with a value of  20   it didnt need any packing or insurance or popcorn  it was already broken  they quoted me  9 49 for the empty cardboard box and  11 to put the item in the box    what planet are they living on   they obviously get away with all this since theyre still in business but i wonder how  i rarely see any customers in their store 
this is not your average dentists office people  first  they have the most friendly  helpful staff who are accommodating with scheduling  forms  and payment  when you arrive they explain everything in great detail and even give you a tour of the office  they offer you bottled water  juice and a variety of snacks  and have disposable toothbrushes with toothpaste in the bathroom    my first appointment was thorough and pleasant  kristen and michelle at the front desk are genuine and lovely  mary the hygenist clearly knew her stuff and was gentle  and dr  rowe has a professional yet light hearted air about him    i will recommend this dental office to all my friends 
absolutely love this place  after trying a few places when i moved here ended up finding glamher studio  i will not go anywhere else since then  the attention to detail is something i appreciate from nadine  the owner  really friendly and welcoming atmosphere  i would highly recommend this place  i would also recommend to book early very popular 
so i am tired of having to go to the dealership for service on my hybrid  after research i came here and so far so good  everything was explained to me and i felt that there was no hidden agenda and honest service  i will be coming back in to this shop for sure 
after shopping around with other companies i found az best family painting  i had the pleasure of working with jason and his crew  he offered a free and very fair quote and explained all that would come with the house painting which is more than just painting and is more of an external overhaul  the house looks great and was done ahead of schedule  thanks again to jason and his great crew 
this place just keeps getting better  i was aiming for a light lunch while out with a friend  so i got the four crostini appetizer as my meal   so worth it  all the cheeses and fruit were fresh  and there are some great classic combinations involved  apple   brie  goat cheese   cherries  and blue cheese   fig  super filling  on special  i think   for  6 08  of course  and super tasty  i am super happy 
if youre an average white person who might be tired of subway  isnt uncomfortable patronizing an ethnic establishment  and has a little cash and change after popping into to walgreens then give it a try  lots of interesting and new flavors  ive had many sandwiches here  and while they might be not as meaty as what youd expect  theyre always delicious  love the pate options  liver spread isnt usually on the menu in most places  but very welcome on my sandwich   
took my son here for an easter treat  we both love sushi and this was as good as any weve had  im not well versed in the culinary experience of sushi to write anything poetic and moving  but we were very pleased with our meal here   they have an enormous selection  which can be overwhelming to decide upon something perhaps  we went with one of the selections where you get sashimi  nigiri  rolls  we were both stuffed for  40   great price for the amount of food and excellent quality  i would definitely go again 
i was very disappointed in this place  the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because the staff was very nice and the portions were large  but  my food literally tasted like nothing  it had no flavor and i couldnt even finish it  i wouldnt recommend or come back to this place 
i love this place  i regularly come here on my lunch breaks and not only are sandy  erica  and bill the sweetest  but the food is amazing  the sandwiches taste just like their window says   just like moms   my favorites are the turkey green chili  italian stallion  and the hot ham and cheddar  i can no longer go to a quiznos or subway because it simply doesnt compare  this is definitely the best sandwich place ive ever been to 
amazing pizza  great for a snack to keep you going on the casino floor 
if you are looking for a professional installer who wont try to overcharge you for service  then this is the company to work with  i solicited several estimates from other companies in the area for a beginner home theater setup  and they either were severely overcharging for equipment or never even bothered to show up for the estimate appointment  one company insisted that i redo my entire pre wired surround system audio wire even though the house was new construction  i finally got in touch with this company  and the interactions were straight and to the point  there were no hidden fees  upcharging  or other tactics used to drive up the price for amateur home theater buyers  i had initially just contacted infinite designs to install two 55  flat screen tvs  and it took him about 2 hours to do both  i was impressed with his work  no wires   so we discussed setting up the home theater system in the media room  to make a long story short  i got in ceiling speakers  av receiver  sub  and set up for half the price of another company  and got exactly what i wanted  would recommend to anybody 
this service is wonderful  i struggled to keep my yard up by myself  now its always clean and never smells bad  plus  my dogs love them 
garden grove apartments are decent at best  rent is cheap and realistically in life we get what we pay for  hence the 3 stars  we recently move here from another state and during our transition we frequently correspondent with one person  keomy williams  keomy was very professional and responded back to us in a timely manner  as we incurred a few unfortunate situations with deliveries to our apartment keomy showed empathy and great understanding  as well as making good  recommendations  my wife and i are grateful to have had such a positive experience during our transition 
hooters is definitely a cheaper end hotel but they have so much potential  weve stayed here a couple times and its been ok experiences  we got to stay in the bungalows this time and i liked those rooms better  we had some plumbing issues in the first room so they moved us into another room next door but we had the same issues  they worked with us upon check out for the inconvenience so i was happy   i like staying here but its a hit or miss some rooms are good some arnt  if they just invested some more tlc into hooters it would be a awesome place to stay    the pool area is nice but if you want to tan you need to go out early  after the morning the sun sets on the other side of the building so it gets shady over the pool area  one pool is heated and two smaller jacuzzis are too but the nice shallow pool with the waterfall is freezing cold  no one was swimming in it and its been like that for a few months since my last visit     the restaurant sucks  just to make a order we got the run around to 3 different people and some of them had no idea what they were doing  after some time we got the order  some good ole fashion hooters wings   i was excited until we opened them in our room  they werent even nuggets  smaller then chicken nuggets  the sorriest excuse for wings ive ever seen 
love this place   the service is excellent and the food is delicious   presented nicely  recommend for any appetite  try the bacon wrapped shrimp  or the ice cream sundae in the huge cup   try anything really  its all good 
my friend and i decided to try this place ever since it opened and we finally did  it was a major disappointment   i originally decided to give this place one star which ive never done on any other restaurants  however  i changed my mind to 1 5 and rounded up to 2 star thinking i might was being a little too harsh on it   i had a salad which i do not remember the name of but it sucked    looking out the window and seeing panera across the street  i couldnt help but only comparing these 2 places   my friend ordered some kind of pan fried noodle and it was pan burnt   i will never go back to this place to eat 
ive ordered from them like    5 times   almost always it takes about 50 min  i dont have any complain about that since ive heard that this place is quite popular place for eating out    how i rate chinese restaurant     believe it or not  i breakout in half an hour after i consume fat  oil  especially saturated ones     and after eating how lees breakouts are not as bad as after eating other chinese   
ive had sushi boat here with one of my friend  the fish was not fresh at all and i feel like ive got ripped off  i dont think i am ever going back here again  i am a raw fish  sashimi person  i dont usually eat cooked  warm japanese  maybe their rice ball or warm dish are better  however  the only good thing i liked at this restaurant is their wasabi  i have to admit i loved it    is it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in pittsburgh 
1 5 but i rounded up for late night fast delivery  ive ordered from this place based upon yelpers pretty good reviews  however  this was another time to remind myself to  believe nobody but me  meaning the food pretty sucked  yeyyy  thats right  sucked  bad   small personal pizza  omg    its beyond my vocabulary to describe    simply sucked  my food rarely goes into the trash but this time  it did   baked ziti  again  basically the same tomato sauce and cheese as the pizza  result in  sucked   french fries  not the type i liked  skinned and mush  i prefer crispy ones   bbq wings  ummmm     they were soso    ok    didnt suck that as much as pizza and pasta did   the best think was the side salad that came with pasta  it was fresh 
stopped sat evening around 515  eating area appeared to be half to two thirds full  a number of empty tables  were told it would be a 45 min wait  a little strange but we decided to wait  an hour later we were seated  we gave our order immediately upon sitting as we had time to memorize the menu  i ordered the plain burger and my wife a small salad and an app  couldnt be any easier right   took over 45 min to get our food  there appeared to be plenty of wait staff so perhaps short of cooks in the kitchen    meal was ok  nothin special  i wont wait again for average food 
my husband and i went in a few minutes before 7  on saturday night we were seated within 3 minutes  we ordered our drinks a water  and sprite as well as a chip appetizer  chips came  they were ok  over thirty minutes after we ordered our food we were still waiting for our main dish   i went to hostess and asked for bill for chips and soda and explained about having to wait and why we wanted to leave  the right thing to say would have been we are sorry dont worry about check  instead she got our waitress so that she could give us our check  as this was happening they brought our food out  to the hostess table and offered to wrap it up wrong   we waited too long  we wont be back  i also think they need to reorganize their flow of traffic  employees were constantly walking in front of hostess area to bring food outside or bring dishes inside 
disappointing  service not too bad but the  signature  cheeseburger was the disappointment  it wasnt bad  just wasnt good  no taste to it  the waitress wasnt overly concerned  just the usual  sorry   not a terrible experience but not a place worth returning to 
delicious food  reasonably priced and incredibly efficient delivery  first time customer  but definitely not the last 
no no no no  this is a busy restaurant affiliated with the boulders hotel  its a corporate version of a mexican  spanish hotel  i had a salad with roasted pumpkin seeds that was good   the rest of it  fajitas  fish tacos or enchiladas were huge portions but heavy   dull  no tamales at all   the bar was lively   popular 
seriously my favorite place to grab lunch  dinner  i live pretty close by so i can always call and place an order for pick up and grab it before i head home  the staff is amazing as well  my favorite dish is the spinach   artichoke mac but all the dishes are really delicious and well made  props to the cooks 
our a  c died on the first day of summer   it was 110  outside  alaskan air had a tech to me within an hour  3 other competitors said i would have to wait a day   their tech was outstanding   robert had us up   running within a half hour of being here   for less than i expected  i would definitely recommend alaskan a  c to anyone 
super delicious  i visited the ss bbq food truck when they were outside of biddles escape  hands down the best bbq i have found in pittsburgh  i got the pork sandwich with mac and cheese  my husband had the bar b cone which he continues to have food dreams about  good stuff   check it out 
delicious  authentic  this place is fantastic  i was lured in by the smell of tacos and i was not disappointed  great food  friendly service and an excellent selection of salsas and toppings  wish i had more reasons to be in brookline  oh  and  2 per  taco 
let me write in one word   bad experience  large bills  go anywhere except car x
pretty good but it is always the same with italian restaurants when as a customer you hope for home made sauce but it always ends up being  jard  sauce  the flavor was good though and yes i would eat there again
hey their from oregon what else is there to say  btw   for you non oregonians it is pronounced or eh gun so please quit mutilating the name  thanx
every meal at capital grill has been wonderful  and i say that even after having to send food back two out of three occasions  have had a steak and a burger delivered to the table overcooked on consecutive dines  now  thats not great  but the service staff go above and beyond in taking care of the situation  meat can get overcooked  it happens  but how the waiters deal with the situation can make all the difference  in both instances my food was replaced very quickly with perfect and tasty results   overall  there has not been anything weve ordered that wasnt fantastic  the food is pricey  but i think worth it  the steaks  when cooked to the proper temperature  are phenomenal  and the sides like lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach are what dreams are made of   i take one star away because it seems like someone in the kitchen isnt always paying attention  but i will be back as many times as my wallet will allow 
i hate buffets  i almost never i try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality  taste and preparation  the buffet at the bellagio is one of those exceptions  in fact it by far surpasses any buffet i have ever found    here you will find a huge selection of food  anything from beef  pork  lamb  seafood and even vegetarian  everything i sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find  for me the highlight was the alaskan king crab legs  they were perfectly cooked  large  meaty and pre split  its rare that i find crab of this quality  i find the prime rib equally prepared  cooked to a perfectly medium rare  the various pork and chicken dishes were excellent  of the vegetable sides i sampled the mashed potatoes  real potatoes   green beans  corn  salad  etc   all were delicious  of the few breads i sampled were also very good  in short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals i had had in quite a while  i left satisfied and overstuffed    now the bad  at just under  40 its quite expensive  its also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening  the lines can get quite long  given the quality and variety of food it really isnt a bad deal in my view  just make sure youre hungry when you go  for a buffet the buffet its as good as it gets 
during a recent visit to the old scottsdale area i was hit with my usual pizza craving  this is always a good thing  one of my favorite pizza joints  gimaldis  is located just down the street from my hotel  only this time i decided to give someone elses pizza a shot  i had seen oreganos a number of times but had never stopped in  that was until now  i made a left instead of a right and hit oreganos  it was a bit chilly but chose to sit outside since there were patio heaters  the outdoor seating area was quite nice  but a little close to the road making it a bit noisy    looking at the menu i saw oreganos offered numerous dishes  they all look very tasty  they also offer thick crust chicago style pizza  in addition thin crust is also offered   thats good because im a thin crust guy  since this was my first visit i ordered thin crust cheese  in my view the basic cheese pizza is the true test for any pizzeria  after a short wait my pizza arrived  it looked very good  very thin crust but over dressed with cheese  interestingly while it was the traditional round pie  it was cut into squares verse the usual wedges  however the real test is how it tastes  it was very good  better than most pizzerias  that said it wasnt perfect  it was over dressed with cheese  which in turn made it just a bit greasy  still make no mistake  this is very good pizza  maybe even bordering on excellent  yet there is on huge problem  oreganos is located only about a mile from gimaldis  in my view gimaldis doesnt serve very good or even excellent pizza  they serve extraordinary pizza  prices are virtually identical  for me its a no brainer if in the area  its gimaldis for pizza  maybe the only way i would choose oreganos over gimaldis would be if i wanted something other than pizza  oreganos also seems a bit more on the casual fun side   at oreganos youll find a very good pie  just keep in mind if pizza is what you crave it isnt the best  the best lies only lies about a mile away 
youll not see anyone famous   im tempted to give ellis island 5 stars for value alone  however to be honest the food is only average at best  maybe 3 stars  however the great prices make up for a lot  you can get a steak that actually good about 50  of the time  the other 50  of the time its chain  ponderosa  steak house quality  included is potato  toast  salad and beer for less than  10    an even better deal during nfl games   2 small but tasty tacos  jumbo hotdog or an order of 5 wings for  1 each  even better a choice of 5 in house brewed beers  20 oz    all very for  1  all are very good  throw in nfl sunday ticket and its hard to beat   decor nothing special  a little run down    ellis island takes you back 20 years when you could eat and drink cheap 
if your primary objective is to have a relaxing place to go with friends or the kids and the food does not matter very much the buca di beppo is the place for you   the food is ok but that it about it   when you get past the quantity you realize that the food is pretty bland  it is the olive garden of family style italian   a chain that does family style right  although it is a bit more pricey  is maggianos little italy   there you can get loud  enjoy your friends  but have much better quality food 
on 9  27  16 jws cesar  with david  installed home depots beautiful carpet in my three bedrooms and closets   their work was wonderful and they were very nice people as well   so now my flooring is complete   i have had carpets and tile installed in my entire home by jw  and it looks beautiful   i send heartfelt thanks again to shane and curt henson for their stunning tile work  and cesar and david for their highly skilled carpet installation   these men  and their amazing supervisor wes  were so customer oriented and helpful  so i am thrilled to have had jw flooring take care of my entire flooring needs in my renovated home   looking back  the entire jw experience was seamless  from jws communication in selecting installation dates and follow up reminders  to the prompt arrival and great work of the installers   thanks to jw floor covering for such valuable employees  thank you wes  shane  curt  cesar and david for making my installations a happy event   i love my transformed house and i give jw the credit 
on a drive circumnavigating lake erie november 2016  we stopped in cleveland  in tremont  at edisons  and we were so very happy we did  edisons is a fantastically warm and inviting space  friendly and kind staff  great beer and cider selection  and the pizza   wow  totally scrumptious crust  thick and flavourful  the best of the best  and the toppings fresh and delic  cant recommend it highly enough   a year later im still thinking about going back 
i certainly am not one who enjoys the dentist but decided to give this place a try  as it is literally within walking distance of my home  office staff is friendly  technicians are very gentle and pleasant and i really liked dr  kubota  i had my teeth cleaned and x rayed on my first visit and did the zoom teeth whitening on the second visit  dr  kubota answered all my questions and gave me great referrals for wisdom tooth extraction  i also enjoyed the fun decorations of the office and the tv  movie options to watch while youre stuck in the chair  i would definitely recommend harmony dental and have since referred someone 
the majority of my technology gadgets are not apple but i have visited this store a few times and have been impressed each time  there are tons of staff members around to help and greet you  even when the store is crazy busy  i had the pleasure of working with quin and stephen and both are exceptional staff  stephen gave the youth i work with an amazing experience through the apple store  field trip   i was impressed at how much they learned and its always rewarding to see a child smile and enjoy themselves  if you work with youth and are looking for an awesome  and free  field trip  definitely check this one out  store is clean  cool and enjoyable to use all the product  great location too   lots of stores and restaurants in the same complex  definitely recommend 
showed up for breakfast at 615 left at 625 with no service  great place to eat  but no one came up to greet us or seat us  we wont be coming back  at least have a bell to let yall know someone has popped in to eat 
joey did a great job in the bar  he was handling the whole bar by himself withe ease  the environment was warm and welcoming  couldnt hear music very well  food was good quality and reasonably priced  we will return 
this is one of the newer sams clubs in town  its not usually busy either  i barely ever see a lot of people here  service here is spotty  its either pretty good or pretty bad  i guess it depends on who you get  selection is ok  not as good as costco but they also carry stuff that costco might not have 
meh  this place is okay  went here for a wsop tournament  it is annoying how you have to take a cab too and from this place  i also saw penn and teller here which was awesome  would definitely recommend that  i have heard from a few other poker player that the rio has huge problems with theft around the wsop
plentiful portions for breakfast  brunch and lunch  as well as plentiful options of the menu  heaping salads  packed sandwiches   all day  breakfast omelets with your choice of a side  salad  fruit  etc  and breakfast  dessert crepes happening at all times  desserts like chocolate mousse and french pastries are also on hand    in a quick trip to sewickly  i ate here twice   breakfast one day  lunch another  had a salad and the pancakes  friends had crepes  omelets and sandwiches  no complaints  go with your craving   i dont think you can go wrong   this place is a gem 
wicked spoon is an excellent buffet option at the cosmopolitan   let me start of with their executive chef   mark crane  since i am a vegetarian  i am skeptical about large buffets but mark was patient and showed us all the vegetarian options and even made us a fresh pasta and stir fry  i had a chance to chat with him and he is definitely the force behind this establishment  i would definitely give him 5 stars for both his culinary talents and his friendly and accommodating attitude   the food was great   salads  pasta  especially mac and cheese  pizzas and deserts  the pistachio gelato and lemon tarts were my absolute favorates 
definately overhyped   opulent prices  average everything     i was glad i had the coupon from the yellow pages online for a  15 discount   still disappointed for the price    the cuts of prime rib were probably twice the thickness of other places   the chef could not get them well done after 3 tries   my wife was seated next to the beautiful fireplace  but   was unable to move her chair for comfort due to the fireplace brick on the floor   my wifes onion rings were inedible to her due to the amount of grease   a baked potato was graciously substituted at no charge   the anniversary cake was less than optimal  often had to wait for the service to appear   the rowdy regulars at the bar  ruined the mood and the ambiance   went home full  but  overall  a big disappointment for our first try there 
im visiting from new york city and was told that the chocolate bar is a must while im in town  my family and i walked in moments ago and was greeted by the most miserable and aggressive hostess i have ever encountered  how she ever secured a position that requires interaction with visitors i will never understand  then she escorted us to a table  said a few more aggressive comments  and walked away leaving us with fingerprint covered glassware and a crumb covered table top  perhaps we just visited while they were just have an off lunch  either way  we will never come back 
nice place   small   loud    our party of 3 got seats at the bar   only one bartender during happy hour   he  mike  was great  but service would most likely have been quicker if he had a back up  as he was tending both the bar and the outer tables   felt this limited our opportunity to save some    on their happy hour prices   we ordered 3 appetizers  cracker jax  marinated and cheese balls   all were good  however i enjoyed the cheese balls the best    one other note of interest  the font on their menus is quite small and the bar is dark  you may want to change that 
our server  david  was very animated   but did offer some great suggestions   we shared the veal meatballs with creamy risotto  based on other yelp comments  and it was fabulous   my hubby had the crusted lambchops and he really liked them   i had the veal chop and it too was very good   all dishes came out hot  which is always a pleasant surprise   we shared a bottle of wine and creme brulee for desert   wine was one of the lowest priced available at it was decent and the creme brulee tasted like creme brulee   will consider coming back  but only occasionally   total bill w tax   tip exceeded  200  which is way over our budget 
wow    quintessential vegas  baby    beatiful and amazing sets   dont know how they fit them all back there  fabulous costumes   great singing and dancing   loved the gaucheros  the muscle men  and the flying guy scene   the women were all gorgeous and lit up the stage   im a big cirque du soleil fan  loved blue man but this show blew them out of the water   fantastic    hint  its hard to find discounts for this show but a discount of 10 bucks if you buy a combined ticket with the eiffel tour observation deck 
nice place for a stop while waiting for the ferry   they have indoor and outdoor seating available   grab a beer or two   they have a good selection on tap   fosters   san miguel  leffe  and much more     fish and chips were excellent   they came recommended and did not disappoint    served on a butcher block with fries  tartar sauce  and creamed peas   fish was fresh and piping hot    am hungry just thinking about it 
i had on a pair of open toed flat shoes and the bouncer would not let me in  he said it was a safety hazard  i found this to be ridiculous  i had on a nice outfit but just chose not to wear heels because my feet hurt that day  oh well 
 5 99 steak and eggs deal that you wont see posted anywhere  not even on their menu  i couldnt believe it  my bro recommended it to me and i had to text him to double check it was true because i didnt see it anywhere  asked the lady at the front just to make sure it was still going and she confirmed it    there was very little wait and the server took our orders quickly and the steak came out reasonably fast  the main issue i have here is that they do not know how to cook their steaks consistently  my friend ordered his steak rare and got it medium rare  i ordered mine medium rare and got it done medium well  my other friend ordered hers well done and got medium rare  no  our plates were not mixed up  the little fork thingies on the steaks indicated how they were cooked  none of them were correct    anyway  the eggs were great and the potatoes were excellent  well cooked and reasonably spiced  i think the potatoes are the hidden gem in this deal  it should be called steak  eggs and potatoes   they also give you 2 slices of bread  4 pieces  along with jelly  they layer a ton of butter onto the bread too 
i have gone here multiple times as it was the cheapest nail salon near campus but you definitely get what you pay for  i had the male  i think he was the dad  for a regular fill and every time he did my nails they always turned out uneven and the nail polish was a different thickness on each nail  while he was friendly and tried to make conversation  i do not recommend wasting your money here  especially now that they have raised their prices 
lovely restaurant with friendly servers and good food   i havent saved enough to try french laundry so coming here will be as close as i can get   i had the croque madam   the egg was cooked well and i loved how the yolk was a little runny but not slimey   the fries were a little over seasoned but it was perfect for my light hangover   the meal came with homemade jam and butter and freshly baked french bread   i cant wait to try his other restaurant when i win the lottery 
soooooo yummy  not your average drive through  the fries are so good with a delicious pepper and stand sauce on the side  the burger is well seasoned and great   definitely go 
this place is so delicious  i stopped in for lunch expecting hair a quick mediocre food and it totally exceeded my expectations   i come here all the time  super nice staff and amazing food  definitely recommend 
loved the fried chicken   last minute decision to get southern cooking  this place was close to where we were  friendly staff  wait to be seated only 10 min  delicious biscuits  mostly like a mini chicken slider but super delicious  fried chicken was excellent and loved the grits we ordered  lots of savory with a very tiny hint of sweet  i recommend this place 
well i usually do not write reviews  if i do then either angry or really happy with their services first thing first i liked the way they treat the people  there are few other restaurants in phoenix they do sell their product and done  but this place is different  been in usa for 5 yrs have tried lots of indian restaurants but the taste was somewhat okay  neither satisfied and no complaints  kohinoor has the taste of indian flavor  try their appetizer and you can expect what would be next thing to go for my friends had their buffet it was too delicious and we already decided when would be our next team lunch  i would definitely recommend this place 
this is a must for those biscotti lovers out there  they had about 20 different flavors of biscotti to choose from including almond  which was very tasty 
absolutely horrendous  the apathy of the genius bar is unparalleled to anything i have experienced anywhere  im considering from switching from apple products so im not held hostage by these condescending jerks 
amazing menu and great beer selection    probably the friendliest bar and wait staff in phoenix  dont pass this place up 
i remember my first visit to delux it was before heading over to shop in the craziness that is last chance  anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries   thats all she had to say  i was down   its a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall  it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way   i ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy  i like mine a little crispier  but they were still delish   and the chinese chicken salad   mmmmmm the flavors were amazing  the red peppers  cilantro  romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for  i was a little worried that i wasnt going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2 im ashamed to say that the 3 times that i have been to delux i have had this salad  im hooked  next time i promise i will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about   maybe 
ive been to az 88 several times for drinks and the last time i came in i finally decided to try some of the food  me and some of my girls decided to meet here on a friday night and we planned ahead and made reservations since this place is always packed on the weekends      i absolutely love the vibe in this place  with its various art pieces throughout the space and the hidden dj at the above the dining area it always feels lively when you walk in   some of us arrived a little earlier so we had drinks at the bar while the rest of our party arrived  i started with one of their delicious martinis  once everyone had their drinks we moved to our table so we could order dinner  i decided to go for one of their chicken sandwiches and our server convinced me to add avocado and cheese to it  i was pleasantly surprised when my meal came out  the chicken sandwich was delicious  and i was immediately happy i decided to go with the servers suggestion  the waffle fries were good and crispy and i loved that they also put some pieces of fruit on the plate to balance everything out  it made me feel like i was being slightly healthy      there was a total of 6 of us and everyone loved their food and drinks  our server was awesome  she was very patient and checked on us pretty regularly  and she didnt complain when we asked if our checks could be split  this place is definitely a great place to start out the night or event to bring a date or out of town visitors  i will def  be back soon 
great place to go on lunch breaks  food is great quality and the workers are kind  one of my favorite spots  cheesesteaks are very good as well  highly recommend 
this place is the worst  the food was good  but we waited over two hours for seating  the staff made no effort  and the drinks were ridiculously overpriced  the bartenders charge more than the advertised price for the drinks  they also pocketed our change  i would not recommend this place to anyone  the atmosphere was cool  and the decorations were pretty sweet  but this business was a sh t show and after they nearly made the birthday girl cry i can say im never ever going back 
my place was very dirty and brian and his team did a great job  i am very happy with the job that they did
this is just for the food part of it  i have never step foot in the bar  my food was delivered and it was very good  i had the cheesesteak and fries my only issue is with the 4 99 delivery free other than that i will try to place again
this place is amazing  i had a return and it was 3 years old  they took it back no questions asked  and i was told that ll bean guarantee their products for life  now that is a good company
i am a frequent visitor to las vegas  i try to make it there at least 8 times a year and i have stayed at almost all of the big name hotel  casinos   i am partial to the hard rock hotel due to familiarity with the staff  concerts  party people every where and of course the access to the rehab pool party  but i must say that the palazzo is by far the best hotel i have stayed at to date   check in was speedy and easy  the gentleman at the check in desk who helped me was far beyond accommodating and aimed to please   my room was beautiful   so spacious and clean  with the best view of the palazzo pools and the strip   i see that some people have said that they were easily lost in this hotel but i did not have this problem   i ordered room service and we received it in a reasonable amount of time  it was delicious however  extremely pricey   you might want to pass on that   we loved our room so much we opted to stay 1 more night   i went down to talk to the same gentleman and he was awesome  he gave us a great deal on our additional night   i will stay here again and again 
moon valley nurseries have been absolutely amazing   we had several crews out here last week for planting and irrigation and they are such hard workers and so passionate about their job  lp  mike  troy  jared  everyone i have met has been absolutely amazing  thank you 
i called big j for a plumbing issue and his service was excellent  if you are looking for a honest  efficient  reliable and all around great plumbing company  big j plumbing is who you should call  i highly recommend 
budget movers helped last minute when we moved into the community and needed someone to unload our truck   they also provided the service we needed when we moved from our rental condo to our own home   efficient  friendly and economical 
great rooms and great casino  upgraded our room for free and has the best robes   buy them because you cant find them anywhere  i took mine home and they never charged me   lucky much 
we enjoyed dinner  the lobster rolls were crispy and tasty   green salad with green goddess dressing was very creamy and garlicky and large enough to share  i had the waygu flat iron  it was delicious and soft as butter   the sauces were delish  adult tater tots smoky and cheesy  all over very fine meal 
the practical series  and advanced practical series were the most enjoyable classes ive ever taken  chef pascal is funny  knowledgable and a delight to learn from  i learned so much about methods of cooking various meats  vegetables and sauces  which i have now incorporated into my every day cooking  the advanced series taught me how to put together complete meals  from the combination of foods  to coordinating the prep and cooking times  all in all  the cca is a terrific school for the home cook and aspiring chefs  
after a long week of running a partner conference  myself and the team wanted something unique to phoenix  az  which had a good steak and seafood combo   thanks to yelp  durants came up   after confirming with the concierge at the resort  we realized the place is pretty legit   so we are in the car  driving up  and we pull up at the stoplight across the street   looking across  the place looked like a strip club   pink building with no windows     seriously  do we abort   ahhh heck  lets do this    so the 10 of us go in   when you walk in  you enter through the kitchen   the wall paper is red and looks like it has texture to it    ok  are we making the right choice  yes  we are here lets do it   i ordered the bone in ribeye and let me tell you  it was to die for   even better than that was the scallops and loaded baked potato    dessert came  and oh snap daddy likes  creme brulee in three styles  coconut rum  chocolate and berry   would i recommend it again    heck yes   rock on durants
in my opinion  this is the closest to authentic italian you can get in the greater charlotte area    they really put a lot of love into the dishes here   i have had numerous items off of the pasta menu but nothing really beats the good ol classic cheese ravioli   i always like to add sundried tomatoes and artichoke hearts just because they are delicious    the owner is there a lot and always very welcoming   he usually helps us select a good wine because we dont really know the difference between mediocre and the top notch stuff   so  he usually educates us   overall  we always have a great time here and have never been let down     enjoy    ian m 
absolutely hands down one of the best italian restaurant in surprise az service is absolutely phenomenal even down to the manager noel who was very attentive to us  we will definitely be visiting again
i had a peel done here with micro dermabrasion i  really enjoyed it  the woman charity did a great job on it  however i also had a wax on my face done and  it was not so good  i had to come home and use my tweezers to get the hairs on my eyebrows that were missed  but i will be returning for another micro dermabrasion because i enjoy it  i really reccommend getting the pumpkin peel before because that is what made it so enjoyable for me 
this place has amazing food  i have been here six times and it was incredible every time  they also have that delicious bold missy beer that pairs great with all the entrees  sushi is also amazing 
ireny   morgan gave my husband   i a couples massage that was one of the best we ever had   highly recommended   
closest off the strip reasonably priced jewfood in the northwest side of the valley  matzo ball soup and pastrami spell comfort food  like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in  great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry 
i have been through two pregnancies with market grille cafe pomegranate chicken as my must have honey drive over there before they close because i have got to have it food    the staff was always wonderful every time i called to place my order for my long suffering husband to come in and pick up    i love everything on the menu  this is the place we bring our out of town relatives who eat gluten restricted diets  everything tastes and feels fresh and healthy  never a disappointment    the dining area is small but there are tables outside for a great evening meal    finish with the baklava cheesecake and you will be in heaven 
cod was good as expected but other dishes paled in comparison to nyc  beef dumplings were not worth the high ticket price
im not a huge fan of their coffee because its very sweet  but ask and they will customize it for you by lessening the syrups pumps etc   they are really nice people   i love their tea  their overnight oats  and think its really neat they also sell cocktails at night  its my favorite spot to get work done 
what is all the hype about 808   this place honestly is a joke    i go in to order to go food at 5pm   there are 8 people in the restaurant dining  so not many people mind you   i place my order with a girl who was really put out by my wanting to order to go food   she places my order and tells me it will be 15 minutes   ok  that seems reasonable   42 minutes later  still no food   2 people who ordered after me had their food come up   when i inquired  the same girl seemed even more put out   no apology  no offer to give me a soda or water while i wait for a lousey 3 sushi rolls   boy  obviously customer service is not a requirement at this place   i get no answer except  they said it will be up soon    again  no apogy for the ridiculous delay and time needed to prepare it   it finally comes up and she sends me on my way    i was agitated to say the least but i was hoping that the story might take a slight turn for the better when getting the food home and having my sick wife who i got it for to cheer her up be so amazing it would quench the sour taste of the 45 minute wait   well  not to be   the sushi was average at best   for all of you who have reviewed 808 as having amazing sushi  you need to get out more   i have been to so many places with better food quality and certainly more friendly people    808  you need work   a lot of work   i am sorry i wont be back nor will i be sending anyone your way   you had a shot to secure a life long sushi eater and lost it   first impressions are critical in the fickle world of the restuarant business and well  yours just plain sucks 
i had pristine do a move out clean for me for a 1700 sq  ft house   i do not know how else to say this but they are amazing   the best cleaning i have ever seen done by any cleaning company ever   and i have experience in this area having worked in hospitality for over 18 years   i am as neat and picky as it gets and they did an incredible job   if you go with any other cleaning service you are just plain foolish   call them  you will not be sorry 
have not been there in years and it seems like this is true for every one else  i should have know this was not going to be a good experience when there were only three tables seated during the dinner hour  also overheard the barmaid say to our waiter  well at least youll have more than one customer tonight   wife seafood platter was cold when served  my prime rib was tasteless for other than salt  even the home fries with gravy were to salty to eat   only good thing was the homemade banana cream pie   wont make this mistake again  
this hotel was amazing  the rooms were very clean and neat  i got a great deal and so was nervous because it was such an amazing price but when we got there we were extremely impressed  the staff at the front desk was very friendly as well  i will be staying here every time i visit phoenix  i cant say enough good things about it
some of the pharmacy techs are very slow and unprofessional  i would not recommend anyone going here for prescriptions 
even i cant believe that i gave china poblano 4 stars but i did   jose andres perverse juxtaposition of mexican cuisine and chinese cuisine works   who would have thought   like many of jose andres other restaurants  china poblano serves small plates   thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting   on my visit  i sampled  among other things  the steamed pork buns  the queso fundido  the shrimp mojo  the tuna ceviche  cochinita taco  the barbacoa taco  and the lucky 8 sui mai beef     the queso fundido  the shrimp mojo  and the cochinita taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest   the queso fundido is wonderfully rich  as one would expect  and is accented well by the spicey chorizo   the shrimp mojo had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers   and  the cochinita taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be     while the three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none of the dishes i tried were bad   by mixing and matching between two very diverse cuisines  china poblano keeps things interesting and should have something that appeals to everyones palate 
i had to give one star but clearly no stars is warranted  did not receive my order as i requested  i asked for extra sauce and what did i get     a super dry ass pizza  smh what to do  do i call and say something   no since i had to waste my money i plan to make sure others dont waste theirs either 
i really liked their chips and salsa as well as their street tacos   but their horchata was horrible  but they were nice enough to give me jamaica which was good   i mixed their salsa to get one that i thought was perfect   about 1  4 hot and 3  4 mild gave it the right kick and flavor for me 
i must admit that i didnt really care for raw fish but after trying this place out once i became obsessed   you get a very good portion of food for the price and they are very good about wanting less  more for the toppings  only some items have extra charge for extra  i have tried the bowls out different ways with rice  with veggies  different fish  sauce and each time it still tastes so good  ill choose this place if i ever crave a good poke bowl
food was okay  i had better  too overpriced for the taste  very bland food  ill stick to chinatown  and seemed like servers did not want to be here
you guys who got turned away have a right to be upset  that girl below who is defending the club for the dress code has no clue  the issue here isnt the dress code in fact  you guys were probably turned down because 1  you came in a group of guys only and  or 2  they dont respect you  ive seen tons of white guys get in without adhering to the dress code  these bouncers look at you guys and make up their mind in three seconds whether or not they want to let you in  if you are not white  thats a minus  if youre not getting a table  thats a minus  if you dont look like youll be tipping them  thats a minus  officially  assuming you are a guest in the hotel or know someone who can get you in that line  if you are the only ones in line and they ask if youre on the guest list  thats a clue they dont want you there  if you pass that  youll just get more problems  like you need to have a 1 1 ratio  shoes  shirts  etc  i went once and went straight to the hotel line  there were three guys in front of me  these guys were dark skinned indian and arabic guys  officially  they thought i was with them and had to leave because those three and me didnt have a button down shirt  i told them i was by myself and i knew i was good to go  they only discriminate because they thought those guys were foreign terrorists or something  another time i went  a black girl i knew thought she had a table  as soon as the waiters figured she wasnt good for a big tip  they asked the whole party to walk outside for a second  they then told them good night  this club is basically for asian guys who want to be cool and will end up spending a lot of money on tables when the irony is that asian girls come there to be hit on and to hit on white guys  im white and know the things that come with being white  but still  asian guys are better off as soon as they know what tao is all about 
the food here is awesome  good sized portions for the money and they cook it more like a home made meal  ill be back 
i just visited this spa yesterday and was not too happy  i will start off by saying that the facilities are very nice  my favorite part was the eucalyptus steam room  however  it is a little disappointing when you go here with someone of the opposite sex and the only joint activity available is the pool  the waterfall grotto  which i was very much looking forward to  was closed and will be for the next couple of months  we ended up having to spend a couple of hours apart  when it was time for the pedicure we went up to the salon  the two women who gave us pedicures were very nice and accommodating  i will not  however  ever return here for a pedicure again  it was twice the price of my normal salon and not half as good  i left with callused feet and an in pain upper back  im laying here at 3 30 in the morning writing this review because my back is in so much pain that i cant sleep  i had to use a very uncomfortable extra pillow in the chair because it couldnt scoot far enough forward for my feet to comfortably teach the footrest  this not only caused back pain but it also meant that i wasnt able to use the massage option on the chair  the bottom line is that im extremely upset that i paid over  200 for a couple of mediocre pedicures and a sleepless night caused by this back pain  i will certainly not be returning to the salon  i would not recommend anyone else come here for the vastly overpriced pedicures either 
the first thing i noticed is this restaurant seems to be having an identity crisis  from the outside it looks like they went to universal studios or mgm and robed one of the lots  it has the tongue in cheek psychedelic references  and then healthy options on the menu  i couldnt determine what demographic theyre trying to reach  and i couldnt understand what theme theyre trying to portray  the food was okay  a bit pricey for what i got  the bar area is beautiful  and the drinks are very good 
ive always had a very positive experience in cosco  recently i went there looking for items for a holiday party  i was able to locate everything that i needed  and even had two people assist me with caring my items  the lines are usually long at the register  but move along at a fairly quick pace  they had everything i needed in stock  and a few things i probably shouldnt have purchased  but its cosco right  i seem to have no self control with random impulse purchasing  im probably headed back there soon  to finish up my christmas shopping  you got to be careful with the total price as your items will add up very quickly 
i went to the biryani house on hayden because i wanted cheaper curry than the indian hut on church was offering  i ordered mattar paneer  chicken korma  onion bhaji  and rice and it came to about  22  yes  this place will do just fine for my curry cravings    its not that i cant handle spicy food  but i ordered what i thought are 2 mild dishes  both had a good kick to them  which i found surprising but acceptable  i wonder if anyone else is not so accepting of a traditionally mild dish served spicy    ive done take out twice now  and both times the waiter  host failed to impress me with customer service skills  monosyllabic responses to every question might be efficient  but it isnt pleasant  while i waited  he grunted at the other tables in what  i think  was offering refills on the drinks  the second time i ordered over the phone in advance  and the phone manner was equally poor  meh  i dont care that much  if i can feed me and my boyfriend  with some leftovers for lunch the next day  all for 20 bucks  im satisified   oh and there is another biryana house just on wellesley  i think  that is much bigger  and must be where these photos are from 
such a fun place   great menu with unique choices   not your typical mexican place   we had great service and the guava marg was fantastic   will definitely be back next time im in town 
great atmosphere and even greater haircut  the guys know all the latest looks and trends and are pros at them all  hard part slick back no problem  crew cut fade perfect every time  not a less than stellar barber in the shop  been going for two years since i moved havent been to another barber since  did i mention theyre about 1  3 the price of barbers in old town  get to j moose you wont regret it 
well i have to give blue hound the fifth star for the service  atmosphere and of course the food   we went with the chefs choice four course menu  everything was perfect but i especially loved the double cut pork chop  cant wait to return
stopped in for breakfast on friday  great service  great food  had the spinach and cheese omlette  awesome    local business     support it     see ya friday morning     
cant get any better then this  had two  2  pine trees removed and this company did a wonderful job  the service and cost were perfect   as an insurance property person i would highly recommend them 
the service may not be friendly  and some certain food might not be tasty  but if youre filipino or going to a potluck   try a tray of chicken wings for 25 bucks  theres so much of it and they are so good 
tim ritter is incredible  very trustworthy mechanic  he is extremely knowledgeable in his profession and performs the work exceptionally well  ive taken my car here four times and each time tim was able to help diagnose the problems and recommended all possible options even when the best option was not to spend money on the car  i will take my car here for the rest of my life 
we frequent this restaurant regularly because it is close to home and always meets our expectations  the food is always great and reasonably priced  the staff is also very friendly  we eat in the bar sometimes because the wine is 2 bucks cheaper per glass  we really like this particular macaroni grill at desert ridge 
hands down my favorite sushi spot in phoenix   i dont even go to any other sushi restaurants  try these rolls   booty booty  maui  and lion king  delicious 
fun staff and cheap drinks  bike night on thursday and karaoke on friday and saturday  great bar food 
a cute little family run restaurant  a renovated house  with a super friendly owner and delicious food    i went here with my brother on a weeknight  and had no problem getting a table without reservations  but the place was pretty full  so if you have a larger group  then it may be difficult to just walk in   we ordered the mussels as appetizers  and they were really good  the tomato based sauce was perfect  i wish i had saved some of the fresh bread to soak up some of that sauce  but  alas  i had already inhaled it  and then we ended up ordering a couple of the daily specials   braised veal with fettuccine and giant pasta shells baked with ricotta cheese and asparagus  both were excellent  my brother especially enjoyed the bone marrow from the veal   the only downside to this place is the service was a little slow  at one point  i think the owner forgot about us   she said she would be right with us and then just never returned   but i wasnt in any hurry  so it didnt really bother me   overall  i really enjoyed the meal and the prices were reasonable  ill definitely be coming back to try out some more daily specials and dishes from the menu 
ive had all three of my tattoos done here  and i can tell you that both heather and marge are amazing   they are both professional  incredible artists  and so patient   i just finished my third today and cant wait to figure out my next one   both of these amazing women will create the artwork you want  either from a design you bring in or  as with my third  based on two or three different designs that were melded together      if youre thinking of getting inked  seriously  call them   i will never go anywhere else 
first time here and we couldnt be more happy we stopped by  food was very tasty and the portions were large enough to share  but if youre a yelper  foodie that is never an option   service was excellent  had multiple waitresses  waiters check in on us and i believe the a manager as well   next time we are in town you know where we will be 
my only gripe is i wish it was closer to my home  i seriously doubt you can get better bar food at what they charge anywhere else in cleveland  the fried mushrooms   theyre not portabellos but they are the biggest mushrooms i have seen anywhere in town  served piping hot i sprinkle on a little parmesan cheese  they have a great earthy  flavor and not only are they big the full order portion is huge  ditto for the onion rings  the bartenders are great too   update  mushrooms went a bit downhill  nowhere near as big  since i wrote the original review 
milestones has a pretty standard chain offering   so although the food is okay  my question to any of you would be to explore so many of the other amazing restaurants in this area    we chose milestones for a family event   and we had elder grandparents in attendance with mobility issues  milestones was actually their choice  not only did it take forever to order for our group of 15  we were then asked to abide by their 2 hour rule   and they wanted to rush us into the bar area to finish up dessert    i understand that the downtown location is bound to be busy  however  i certainly cant imagine why id ever return for terrible service and mediocre food  there is much better to be had in the area  and well take our family outing elsewhere 
food 3 5  5  50  of final grade  came to this place on a thursday night  and it was packed  i ended up ordering a plain cold matcha  and boy was it refreshing  i wanted it to go  but they explained that the quality might differ  so they can only offer it to me in store  i ended up drinking the tea from a nice matcha bowl  which they used to whisk the matcha powder with water right in front of me  i havent the chance to try their other foods yet  but from the looks of other customers  they were very satisfied  next time im in town  i would most likely swing by to try their other foods   ambiance 3  5  15  of final grade  little can be said about the ambience  it had a slightly more polished feel than  say  chatime  but in the end it was obviously a place you drop in to buy take out drinks  they did  however  have a small  japanese  traditional seating area at the back that might be able to fit about 6 people max  too bad i didnt get to sit here  i only gave it an extra  5 points for this though  because it seemed odd to me how they expect people to sit and enjoy their tea when there is such a busy and fast paced atmosphere about  although the general experience was great  the place itself was small  which felt very cramped for me the entire time   service 3 5  5  15  of final grade  there was something about their service which i cant quite put my finger on that was good  they werent really chatty  but they were professional while being happy and enthusiastic about their products when i asked them about some other products  in general  their service was as refreshing as their matcha   cost 2 5  5  10  of final grade  the pricing was standard for a downtown establishment  think starbucks range   other 2  5  10  of final grade  brownie points round   brownie points only for the smiles the staff had   final grade   63 5  100   3 stars  tldr  try it just for the heck of it  i can definitely see myself going back to try their other stuff once i finish my bukkitlist of foods  this place  however  isnt special enough to go downtown specifically for  the place was too cramped 
food 2 5  5  60  of final grade  meh  is all i can say  for a place that is reminiscent of a bubble tea house  and for the size of the facilities  the menu is very expansive  but the grade of the food falls at that   a bubble tea house  after eating the first time  i actually felt sick from the amount of oil they put in their foods  at the time of consumption  i didnt realize how much oil i was consuming  but afterwards i felt way too bloated and heavy   ambiance 2  5  10  of final grade  though there werent that many people  the premises felt loud and stuffy  even though i could hear my friend speak from across the table  in general  the vibe they give off on their website is supposed to be very clean  fresh  light  in reality  they were stuffy  dirty feeling  and heavy  not enough air conditioning  perhaps  but it had a very peculiar sense of being run down as well  despite nothing peeling off walls or anything  not a place for a date  or anything to be honest  unless they up their facilities game with better air conditioning or ventilation    nobody likes to be eating super oily foods and also being warm at the same time    service 2 5  5  10  of final grade  the service wasnt particularly bad  but it was minimal to say the least  even though we sat right by the cashier  where most of the employees seemed to be lounging  except when someone waves them over  away from their cell phones   our water was never refilled proactively  the people working their didnt really seem like they wanted to be there  or that they wanted us to be there either  what to expect from a taiwanese style teahouse though    cost 2 5  5  10  of final grade  appropriate for the portion sizes and quality of food    brownie points 0  5  10  of final grade  nothing fantastic in particular    final grade   44  100   1 star  tldr  extra salty for getting so oily sick  their only saving grace might be their desserts and drinks  but i only ate their savoury foods  hopefully your experience will be better 
service is crummy  and the food mediocre   the pub burgers so so with shredded iceberg its more mcdonalds than 20 upscale     and cheese will cost you 2 bucks more   compound the lackluster service  mediocre food and  14 taps and its a pass 
fresh off of an airplane and hungry for breakfast we headed to the midnight diner for sustenance  i had hoped for a biscuit with country ham but alas it was not to be found on the menu  i settled for biscuit with sausage gravy and an egg on top  not bad    the menu has a fairly good range of selections  my companions omelet was good  nothing extra ordinary nothing bad 
we decided on this place based on the strong reviews here on yelp  i was a bit disappointed  coffee was very good  but expensive  i ordered the pork lovers omelette  my wife had the ham and cheese  neither was cooked through  there was no bacon in my omelette  the service was slow and i had to ask 3 times to get water  one slice of toast with a small amount of jam is underwhelming  i really see no reason to return 
the food kinda sucked  no flavor at all  the ceviche was decent   prolly tastes better when drunk  but cmon you cant rely on drunk college kids to support crappy food  never going back again
jeff   sean   the owners are characters  the food is wonderful   i love the jalepeno cream cheese  the guacamole dip and the pollo fundido chimichanga 
heard good things and since we were staying at the hrh on a recent trip  july 2016  to vegas thought we would stop in for a late night snack  open 24 hours   i was not impressed  we ordered the nachos and basically they were chips with cheese whiz on them  served on a tacky baking tray    at the time we went it wasnt all that busy  yet the server was tardy bringing us our drinks  just beers nothing fancy  and couldnt wait to give us the cheque  also i asked where the washrooms were located and got a vague response   i would possibly go back to try their hidden steak and shrimp deal  but my expectations would be tempered 
my brother would not stop talking about this place  finally he decided i had to go for my birthday  wasnt sure if that was the best idea but i trusted my brother anyway  this was a few years ago mind you so i was turning 22 at the time  i wouldnt recommend this place to just adults but it is a family eatery for sure  the food was decent but what you really go there for the ambiance  the entire building is a huge instrument and one man controls them all  he does take requests and my brother graciously requested for him to play happy birthday for me as well as a star wars and a disney montage of songs    yes they do montages  it brought me to tears  it was so wonderful  great for birthday parties because you can bring your own cake and the food is decent and cheap  i would probably compare the pizza to peter pipers pizza 
i enjoy this little neighborhood bar    mostly because it is in walking distance and in my opinion  they have the best dirty martinis west of the mississippi   its quiet and can feel a bit clickish   if you dont go often you will feel like a bit of an outsider   this is an establishment where you walk in to and everyone gets quiet as if it was the only bar in the world that doesnt want your business    the strangest thing is  is that the bartenders are slow to serve people they dont know and give grimaces if you are too loud or are laughing  but only if they do not know you   if you can pretend like you are in high school and this is the cool kids club  i am confident you will enjoy yourself   the hidden bonus is they often have tv shows playing   i am proud to say that i discovered star trek while they kept the olive juice pouring 
i love the eclectic atmosphere    i also love the assortment of desserts   the lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast  my favorite sweet is the salted caramel brownie   soooooo yummy    
awesome and interesting  knowledgable staff  great pricing  huge availability   lowest prices contractor grade level led lamps in the valley 
rating this location solely on the ambiance and casino   the palazzo is under the same reward system as the venetian which is called grazie  the grazie seems like a great rewards system that offers a lot of discounts to onsite properites including tickets to madame tuessads and some grand canal shops   the palazzo doesnt have all the pizzazz that the venetian offered but that can be seen as an advantage since there arent as many people stopping through the casino  i am not sure what the price of the hotel is compared to the venetian  the palazzo is connected to the venetian through the grand canal shops which are beautiful and a must see  the casino seemed to have a lot of waitresses stopping by to ask gamblers if they wanted a drink  their high ceilings seem to give off a less smokey vibe 
it was on my wish list to stay at caesars palace  it so grand and luxurious and centrally located and my dream finally came true  luckily for us  we stayed at the linq the last time we were in vegas and gambled too much  that their sister total rewards company caesars  offered us 4 complimentary nights during the thanksgiving weekend  they only charge a resort fee which ended up being around  30 a night  but that is something you just cant beat  we had rented a car for one day because we were visiting the grand canyon the next day  luckily for us my boyfriend is a veteran and we were able to get free parking  be sure to ask the desk attendant if this is something they can accommodate  the hotel is connected to the forum shops and has several famous chef restaurants located within  as well as a food court   we stayed in a junior suite with a jacuzzi  couch and bidet  yea that toilet that cleans you with water  i felt super fancy   the best part was that we were located on the 18th floor which was on a separate set of elevators that allowed us to get in and out of our floor rather quickly    the casino is centrally located so we were close to the bellagio and could access other destinations quickly  but it could be said that the hotel is rather large and to get in and out takes quite some time  a smaller location like the linq was very easy to get in and out of    caesars casino was not my favorite  it seemed that there were not a lot of themed slot machines available  it also has very low ceilings that make it very smokey    per my boyfriend the blackjack player  the blackjack tables seem to only have bad rules  at night  if you are playing less than  25 a hand  then youre playing with bad rules   whatever that means  he said it was worth noting    i really loved our view  the statues  and our comped stay  the employees were very nice and i see just by them why caesars is viewed so highly 
we made an impromptu stop here when my ten year cousin was dying to experience this   20 for five minutes was not my cup of tea  but  15 for a kid who was shaking out of excitement seemed like a good use of money  he opted for the zombie shooter experience  which according to brent h  was told by an employee that this wasnt offered even though it was displayed on their website  so as of 11   21  17 it is   they have signs that they no photography or video allowed  but i managed to sneak one  they strapped him into a harness and have a guy who hold the security rope to make sure they dont fall   he had a ball so for any vr people  it seemed like a good time 
nice place  clean  good food  fun time  can get a little expensive in smaller groups  so i would recommend party of four or more   cant bring in or use driver  wedges or hybrids  because the free way is to close   service was very good  servers are nice and always checking back to make sure you dont need anything   would prefer a standard driving range  but a good fill in to keep up your swing 
what can i say  im impressed  i frequent little india and many of the indian restaurants in toronto and the gta  this place is really good  i ordered take out  butter chicken  tandoori chicken  bhindi   okra   aloo gobi  onion salad  samosas  and onion kulcha bread  the bread was to die for  the bhindi was top notch and thats really hard to find  really hard  the aloo gobi was great  the chicken dishes were great as well  i prefer dark meat across the board so my only critique would be that the butter chicken would be better and juicier if they used dark meat  the sauce was great  and for white meat it was still enjoyable for me and that never happens  theres only one place that does better tandoori chicken and its in little india  i requested the veg dishes be done adhering to strict allergies  which we always request and never get  we are told that they will be modified and every time my husband gets sick  this time that didnt happen   we are still in disbelief  so this place not only offers incredible quality of food  but also respects food allergies  ive found a new favorite restaurant  pure comfort food and peace of mind  bravo 
seafood platter was legit  real soul food  cooked with heart  owner came out to speak with us and her husband is the chef  will be coming back and bringing friends 
great happy hour specials before 6pm   2 tall boys  so theres that  i ordered the pork rangoon appetizer  which was delicious  the outside patio is nice  and they have a pretty large food menu which features modest pricing    my only concern was it seemed like there was 1 person working at the time    it was happy hour  so i feel bad for the bartender  but that being said it did take forever to order  get drinks  get bill  etc    overall great place though  i will be back soon to drop more food on the ground with the slippery reusable chopsticks they provide and overindulge in  2 coors lights 
i use brian douglas  insurance agent  for my health insurance plans  and he always makes sure that i get what i need for the cost that fits my budget  he explains things well  since i have trouble understanding the complex insurance plans  and he is always willing to talk on the phone or email to answer questions  make adjustments if needed  etc  he seems to work very hard   really cares about people 
my daughter went here for a regular exam and check up  they took her card information for payment  they ran the card 3 times  but took the one payment  this incurred  6 worth of fees for the multiple attempts  they then took the money and continue to bill her  we have faxed over the proof of all the attempts and the actual debit  they still continue to bill  pathetic  they need to get it together   why they had to swipe it 3 times when they had their money i have no idea 
huge  tasty sandwiches  the salad bar is amazing  the lettuce so fresh  many great ingredients  i order the half sandwich   salad bar  people from out of town always want to return here  its the best    
took my vehicle here two weeks ago because the coolant light was coming on intermittently   before even looking at the car  the rep indicated perhaps the light was malfunctioning    i had just assumed the coolant was low    after inspecting the car  they quoted  868 because coolant was leaking and the light was malfunctioning   due to the high price  i went to ace automotive in gilbert for a second opinion   interestingly enough  they put it under pressure for 1 5 hrs and there was no leak and the sensor was not malfunctioning   only needed to be topped off with coolant  which they did for free   i will not go back to greulichs 
we came here for lunch and this is a rather new place  seemed busy and upbeat  ambiance is pleasant and service is true to southern custom  very friendly and over the top  temperature was cold in the restaurant  since it is a rainy and chilly day outside  clean place and rather rustic structure  reminds me of a northern cabin home  very pleasant experience overall 
hash house is your typical american diner with big taste and big portion  the second time around i got to tried way more items on the menu and learned to share everything  like before the banana pancake is super fluffy with a caramelized crust thats irresistibly addictive  the chicken waffle is also really good especially if you like herby sage batter and crispy waffles   oh wait  theyre bacon filled crispy waffle  if youre really hungry  go for the chicken pot pie  that thing is not big  its huge  its also filled with very heavy thick cream thats really filling  i just wish it has more veggies and that the veggies are cut into smaller pieces and softer  the scramble is just okay  its probably the smallest portion out of items i just listed   however super cheesy and flavorful     the service is a little lacking as its such a busy place  however the waitresses tried to remember as much as they can and were very nice about everything 
went to first food   bar with my friends for dinner before the start of our saturday night  the waiter was super friendly and helpful  i ordered the filet mignon and a side of mushroom  the filet mignon was juicy  medium rare as asked  and pretty flavorful considered that they just salt and peppered it  the mushroom was very greasy and buttery  i also ordered the white sangria  and oh boy  it came in a small pitcher  the drink looked big  but it was pretty weak    overall  everything was tasty  but nothing too extradinary 
my girlfriend has been asking to go here  so we decided to go before going to a show on 1  8  11   it was a chilly night so the inside was busy  but the outside was pretty open  so we decided to ask for outside seating  there were heaters to make it doable    we were seated pretty quickly which was nice  but that was the only nice thing   after being seated  a server never even came to our table to ask if we wanted drinks   we sat there for 30 minutes waiting without even getting acknowledged by the two waiters working the area even when we tried to get their attention   3 groups were seated after us and received service   i could understand if it was busy and they didnt have enough staff to cover the outside  but from the looks of it  the 2 servers outside were just plain pissed off about something and it wasnt that busy   30 minutes is an inexcusable amount of time to wait to even have a server take a drink order   its too bad because the food sounded good 
what nerve   really     totally ridiculous  how do you take money out of somebodys account that has tried to cancel for the last two months  levi said he would cancel my account but didnt low and behold here comes another  65  but  wait it gets better they come back and want to give you a reduced rate if you continue your contact pass 12 months   no thanks the massage was great but not worth the money  hopefully they get back with me soon so another payment is not taken out of my account without permission or a contract 
we love sushi  we always order 1 special roll  had it the first time at poway sushi in california  highly recommend     its always been fantastic until here  so disappointing  the manager told us dont order speciality rolls on a friday night because we are busy  ok we will keep that in mind and not come back  terrible response   service slow and no bowl or dish to mix your wasabi and soy  wont be back 
im leading the crusade against restaurants that have a hard time including plastic utensils and napkins in orders being delivered to hotel rooms  i specifically requested in my order to include forks and napkins and i got neither  the food was fine but eating all of it with my hands is un effing acceptable  its a hotel  i shockingly do not carry silverware with me when i travel  how hard is this to comprehend 
friendly and knowledgeable staff     i came in to sell a pair of yeezys  the guys here are more than willing to deal with you   definitely will be back with some more sneakers soon  follow them on ig they constantly upload new arrivals at the shop    thank you gents will be back soon   
astonishingly good chicken saag  and their onion kulcha and mint chutney is beyond reproach 
very friendly and attentive service  nice wine selection at reasonable prices    food was delish  will be back soon   went early on sat night with teen son and we both thoroughly enjoyed    grilled calamari was perfectly charred  pizza was devoured by my son and the pasta was very tasty   perfect    glad to have it in the neighborhood 
i called for delivery at almost 10pm  staff was amazing  seemed happy and jolly  and provided excellent service  thank you 
if youre going to shop downtown  youre not going to be getting big discounts  i saw a robert graham shirt here last week for about  200  the same one at a nordstrom rack in nj for  89  but thats not really the point in these places  so to complain about the cost is like complaining about how small the portions are at the nouveau french restaurant  it is what it is  and that tautology teaches us to expect nothing more from something than what it purports to be  in other words  if you want a store where you can get nice brands on a big discount  this aint it  what they have is a nice  low pressure space with clothes laid out not in heaping racks but displayed like little bits of craftwork  you know the type  and salespeople that have been there for years and know their stuff  these guys understand customer service  will guess your size on a first look at you  and will help you find whatever they can  though admittedly the selection isnt wide   as per above     a nice place to shop if you dont really care about getting deals and dont want to search through gigantic clearance racks  designer brands at absolutely the full price  worth a trip  if not just to talk to the salespeople and learn from their sartorial wisdom 
a group of six of us went to check out yard house for dinner     each meal was delicious  the pastrami sandwich with jalapeni sauce is great  as  is the cobb salad  the steak salad  the kale salad   the calamari  we shared all our appetizers  each one had tons of flavor  i have eaten sashimi everywhere in las vegas   this is the best sashimi  so yummy  i ordered two  their chefs are truely chefs who know how to combine flavors with many different ingredients   i also ordered the sea bass  cooked to perfection  flaky  moist with lots of flavor  they place it on yummy vegies with rice  the ribs were tender with great sauce  now the martinis  lots of flavor and alcohol  im not a drinker but the apple martini was tart   sweet and gave me a buzz  one was enough  my other friends had other martinis and
love it   fridays entree is pork chops  so amazing   craw fish etoueffee  wow 
the food and service just became soooo bad now  it took a hour to get our food after we seated  chicken waffle is not that crispy  the original egg benedict  wth  taste like mashed potato mixed with ketchup   ive been here 3 years ago and was much better  sooooo disappointed  never come back again 
i wanted to love this place  but it sucked   the  homemade soup  was mr noodles and  pieces of pre cooked chicken  gross   the table cloth was dirty  service was slow and the weird quietness was just strange   on a positive note  the montreal smoked meat sandwich was decent 
this place just had a soft opening 2 days ago  grand opening coming soon    that being said it was amazing  by far best sushi in strongsville    and trust me  ive tried them all  i am so happy to finally have a place like this close by  we also had the red curry  fried bananas  and spicy crab salad and all was top notch  we are excited to go back and try the rest of the menu  this is some great quality sushi and asian food and very reasonably priced  we will be going here a lot    sorry sweet mango  there is a new top dog in town 
while working in the area big als was strongly recommended to me and my coworkers  it is a very small diner  after entering youre not sure wether you seat yourself or be seated  we were directed by the waitress across the room to seat ourselves  this is your typical diner with a variety of comfort food menu items  i got the reuben and fries  one coworker ordered an omelet  the other a fried fish sandwich  all of our meal portions were a decent size  i was very pleased with the taste of my sandwich  the coworker who ordered the fish was not  she said it was a tasteless minced fish fillet straight out the freezer  the omelette was a winner too  pretty large with fresh ingredients  the service was fairly fast but not the friendliest  waitress  no drink refills and no checking up on our meals  my sandwich and fries came to around  9  not too bad for the amount of food  would i come back  probably  is it one of my more memorable diner experiences  no  ill probably try a breakfast item next time 
had a meeting at scratch yesterday and im in love  i cant wait to go back and try more of their menu items  and especially their desserts   the case full of enticing treats was almost more than i could stand      the whole place was just adorable  i loved the  girly girl  meets  retro punk rock  vibe  who knew something so cute and trendy existed between subway and frys   the iced mocha i had was great  but their selection of teas and coffees was huge  and their menu looked fabulous  i wasnt too hungry  so i tried the crepes  which were delicious  the food the two gals i was with looked amazing though    definitely a  must go back to  
highly recommend  their food has so much flavor   organic  which is rare  we love this place so much  definitely the best health food restaurant in las vegas  thank you daily kitchen
the decor was the only thing going for this place  good service and cool design inside gave it the stars  but the food was very mediocre and disappointing as i love a good al pastor taco    this one had barely any flavor  have to say the margaritas were pretty blah as well 
i enjoy the food but this experience was horrible  it was my second time here  the first time being the soft opening so i excused the service a little bit  after being seated  we ordered the dishes and the food came out pretty fast  we soon ran out of side dishes and the dipping sauce  our server was no where to be found  after about 10 minutes of looking around  someone came to change our grill and i asked for assistance  the person said he would inform our server  after about another 5 minutes  a different server helped  but he came back with half of what i asked for  by then im over this experience  i didnt even wait for the check  we went to the front and paid  i complained about the service to the front and the girl shrugged it off and asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and i asked what would be done and she said she didnt know with a giggle  i wish i didnt tip  but being from the service industry  i couldnt get myself to do that  i am highly disappointed  i only saw my server one time throughout the whole meal  i didnt enjoy dinner because i didnt have what i wanted to compliment my dishes  plus  we didnt even get everything we ordered  horrible  this is my first review ever  i was so upset  i had to share 
ok quality  fish is not always fresh  i recently moved from hamilton and frankly speaking hamilton offers much better and fresh sushi  have to try some other sushi places around  not coming back here    
super yummy pizza and the price point is perfect for all the options offered  my biggest thumbs up about this place is that you are able to create whatever pizza pie you want  my little guys loved their half cheese and half nitrate free pepperoni pizza  this mom absolutely loved their kale pesto sauce  on our next visit we will save room for their gelato ice cream  the service was quick  friendly  and efficient  will we definitely be back   
the food is horrible   i gave my veal to my dog   the little weird host guy acts way stuck up   this is far from italian food  
nasty   big fat guy in the back eating while taking your order   this place is disgusting  
the first time i went here was also my last   the hostess was extremely rude   i mean i get that its busy but as the hostess youre supposed to take care of the customers concerns not antagonize them   anyways  after repeated  by what i can only describe as sheer bitchy ness from the hostess  i left and went to the bachi on sahara where the service was much better   the restaurant itself was less crowded and roomier and the hostess was much nicer  and hotter  might i add   giving this one star rating is still too much  that hostess can go f ck herself with a sharp stick 
average and overpriced   the sausage and pork katsu was dry   the food is made with no care  disappointing 
the pizza just didnt taste that good  other than that  i got two pizzas  one was overcooked   crust on bottom too hard and dry and cheese on top too brown  the other had a topping i didnt ask for  which probably doesnt sound that bad to most  but i find sausage disgusting and digging it out and loosing cheese is no fun  one of the pizzas was supposed to be  double cheese   but there was no difference in the amount of cheese between the two        the service is not that great either  they were kinda rude on the phone 
i lived at colter park in 2012 with no issues and ive been here for almost a year now  yes  i have had a few issues but i have to say that i have had nothing but good experiences with the manager nadia as well as the office and maintenance staff 
after losing my hair stylist of 10  years i was reluctant to try someone new  my cousin referred me to kayla and i have to say  i am so happy  kayla listens to my needs and gives me great styling and product advise  i recommend her and give her 5 stars 
ive been going to central phoenix eye care for at least 4 years  overall ive been satisfied but on my last visit i was charged  60 00 for a contact consultation that i didnt ask for nor knew was happening  had i requested this i would expect to be made aware of the cost but this was a double bummer since i wasnt told i would be having a consultation nor that a cost would be billed to me  when i went in for a follow up i expressed my concern about the charge and explained that i wrote a review on their site and expected follow up  i was told that an office manager may get in touch but no one has   im just not pleased that i wasnt made aware of charges up front and dont think i will return 
love this dental office  dr  connell takes the anxiety out of the whole dentist experience  would highly recommend regardless of where you live in the valley 
i wanted to love this place  i really did   in fact  when we first showed up  i really was in love  it has everything you could ever want for that trip down memory lane  for that factor  this place gets a solid 5 stars    however  the people that work here are very rude  i get it  ok  this place is technically a museum  so i understood completely when he warned one of the guys in my party to be a gentler with the machine  and from there we all made it a point to play gentle pinball    after that  we made our way to the foosball hockey table  playing in teams  we had a competitive game going  while still being gentle  i promise   excitement was brewing  there was some cheering going on  and the next thing we know the power on the game goes out  we turn and look  and mister grumpy pants has the plug in his hand  yelling at us to leave or he would get his off duty cop friend to arrest us  then he started spouting a bunch of bull about how we werent members and it was a private club and we basically werent welcome there    i loved the place at first  but the old man ruined it for me  ill take my business to kiss mini golf from now on  theyre much more laid back there 
cute family market  very good chicken paprikash and sicilian wedding soup  glad to have this option close to home 
one star today  my dinner was good  the server forgot my daughters soup  we didnt get rolls till half way through the meal  we found something on our chicken tenders  then to top it off  two people in our party threw up  one while still there eating  the other half hour later  the management was very understanding and took care of the bill  not sure what was going on in the kitchen tonight  but hopefully nobody else gets sick 
wow   we havent been here in a while  but we ordered the tuscan pepperoni pizza today  amazingly good   the woman in the front was very welcoming and friendly when i picked up  well definitely be going back 
we had a wonderful dining experience   we were promptly seated at a great table outside   we had an attentive  professional waiter  thank you ben for your wonderful service   and the food was excellent  selections chosen from the az restaurant week menu    we were a party of four  and had an absolutely wonderful evening    thank you house of tricks 
after walking the strip all afternoon  my friends and i stumbled into this establishment looking for great  strong  drinks and some good  filling food before getting ready to go out for the night   the house margarita was delicious and the pitcher of sangria was a great choice  however  i wasnt prepared for the tiny plates of food that were brought out    i ordered the chicken empanadas   9  and couldnt suppress a laugh when 3 fortune cookie sized empanadas came out on a tiny plate   aside from the unexpected tiny portions  diegos was just fine   im always a fan of watching people make my guacamole  even though this guac seemed a little bland  and was impressed by the assortment of salsas and different flavored salts that they provide   if i were to go back  id stick to the drinks with chips and salsa and have dinner elsewhere    note  dont show up in tacky flip flops and grubby clothes from the night before   youll feel grossly under dressed as they walk you past the beautiful people and into the back dining room   far  far away from the public eye  
fresh ingredients  cooked to order and really good  rice cooked to perfection  naan needs to be upgraded but overall a really good value 
doval shrimps and portuguese chicken were great  im not a fan of rice yet i loved theirs  negatives  the mussels were average and the service was a bit slow  go on a quiet night if you dont want to wait 
a trip to madison is just not complete without a stop at daisy cafe  prior to coming here  i once believed that all huevos rancheros were created equally  i was quickly proven wrong as their bean egg cheese salsa whatever melody touched my tongue  huevos rancheros de la daisy is my favorite rendition of my favorite breakfast food   as the latter part of their name suggests  their cupcakes are also fantastic  the available flavors change daily  monthly  seasonally  but if available  i recommend the strawberry champagne or cinnamon carrot flavors 
ive been periodically getting tatted by ruck since i got my first tattoo in june of 2015  in total  hes done 4 of my tattoos  every time ive brought in a picture  my tattoo has turned out better than said picture  aside from being a bomb artist  the conversation never runs out with ruck  my most recent tattoo took about three hours  between ruck  myself  my friend who came along  and his apprentices  i dont think we stopped talking  good conversation definitely helps the time pass with larger pieces  overall  this shop has always had a very warm and welcoming vibe  in other shops  ive found the staff to be snobby or unapproachable  and thats simply not the case here  literally everyone is nice  i think it goes without saying that ill be back soon 
visited the spa for a day of using facilities  a couple of treatments and lunch under the umbrella of a special offer   uphall sits behind the m8 near livingstone   the hotel is very pleasant and so is the leisure area   staff are very pleasant and helpful and took great care in explaining the spa area to us    the pool is large and has pleasant views to the outside greenery and surroundings   there is also a steam room and sauna which we re at leisure to use   my only concern was the pool was slightly chilly whereas the steam room was rather too warm   the treatment area is very pleasant and elemis is the brand of choice for facials etc   the therapists were very pleasant and skilful and i had a lovely facial and shoulder massage   the relaxation room was very comfortable with water and fruit to partake off and plenty reading material    lunch was a bento box of salad and fruit and yoghurt   the healthy option but more substantial options were available   all in all a pleasant day in nice surroundings
arrived here 30 min before they were closing  the girl at the front answered the phone while we waited to order  so the rude man who was cooking came up to take our order  my daughter really wanted pasta  they refused and said no more pasta for the night since they were closing in 20 minutes     apparently their clock is fast and at the end of the night service becomes crappy  my husband decided that we should order anyway and get her a side of meatballs instead  i ordered a drink with my food  i didnt get it  when my husband asked to get a drink the guy at the back came up again and acted like this was our fault  i left to sit in the car   my husband brought out the food  it was nothing special  they should can the old grumpy guy
used this service in phoenix both upon arrival and departure from sky harbor   we did not have reservations upon arrival but the man at the loading station got us a van within the next 15 minutes   we did make reservations to return to the airport and i liked the ease of doing this online and the confirmation calls and e mails i received made me feel comfortable that my reservation got to the appropriate place   the van arrived on time and the driver michael was great  van 635    as we are older  he helped us get in and out of the van and was very helpful with our luggage   he was very nice and the van ride was comfortable   this is a very convenient service and i plan to use it again when we visit a city that they serve 
great authentic mexican food  not a beans and rice place  although those are fine too  had a baked pepper stuffed with chicken with a cream sauce  mashed sweet potatoes and grilled fresh corn  wonderful  will go back a lot 
the worst service ever  waited 45 mins for a damn burger and the manager did nothing about  never eat here they suck 
if youre looking for dessert  the only bearable one here is the cheesecake ice cream  even then its not worth the price  save your money and go to kekkou next door for better and cheaper dessert options  food wise its alright  we had the  popcorn    its more like bite size than the classic popcorn chicken size  chicken numerous time and its always consistently good  the taiwanese ground beef is also alright  marked up prices made it not worth though   i would advise against getting any drinks other than tap water from this place  the bubble tea was not worth it  they didnt get what half sugar meant     onto the good things about charidise  good roomy space to study  chat with friends   no one to sit you in so youre free to choose a good spot to sit  free apples for dishes  10   me and my friends used to go here to study but recently their wifi has been the shittiest and weak    tldr  decent comfort food for semi jacked price  get dessert elsewhere
great boardgame atmosphere in the air  there   huge location for snakes  much less depressing than the one at bloor  gets packed because people came in droves and it gets really loud  lots of board game selection  they have like six full shelves of it  the food is meh  id suggest to eat before hand before coming here  the nachos was disgusting  felt like they microwaved the shit out of it    very affordable for groups  great team bonding place 
it was ok  overpriced  forgettable  the only good thing from this place is the crepe cake  which was pretty novel when they first open   be aware that for  8 youre gonna get a really small piece of that cake 
totally surprised by this hotel  the staff was so professional   friendly  the room was very clean    newly remodeled  very comfortable  room service was super quick  we also got everything we requested  bedding   additional room service items  very fast  there are several restaurants in the area  as well as shopping  we got a great rate on hotwire  and also got upgraded when we checked in  would definitely stay again if we were in the area 
we came here last year and we tried alot of dishes but we must say there wings are the best  everything else was yummy too  well be back in the area next week and we will be going back 
i went along on friday evening and had the most amazing meal at the westerly  the ambiance was fantastic  friendly attentive caring staff and brilliant food  this is the place to be   and i cant wait to get back and visit  i particularly recommend the mussels 
if i was on death row and had one last meal    this would have to be it  welcome diner offers hands down the most hearty  homey  savory  authentic food in phoenix  my favorites include the big jim  chicken biscuit w   gravy   bacon  and the pb b  but everything is great  awesome atmosphere and employees  cant ask for anything more  if you like this place  try welcome chicken and donuts 
since my first visit  cartel has significantly expanded this location without compromise   the tempe location  conveniently close to the campus  offers a great environment to study  hang out  i really enjoy the cold brew  hot teas  and the chai tea  its always a good time 
first and foremost   jennifer romass body is sic  she has the most amazing muscle control and the way she moves is so fluid  the show was good  but she is definitely the star 
came here to celebrate a special event  decided on grotto because of the reviews but couldnt be disappointed more  rude and disrespectful owner  server who was very judgmental  we ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment  want a similar experience  make reservations and enter at  your own risk 
everything here is good  delicious drinks  sandwiches and desserts  i will definitely be coming back often to try a variety of their menu items  the staff are all friendly and the owner is very personable and remembers customers  great spot for outdoor seating available  definitely would recommend this place to locals as well as those visiting  you wont be disappointed 
breakfast at alma    wow   great service by eric ramirez  quick coffee and juice   then to an incredibly wide menu   touch to settle on choices  but we had the tres locos  generously sized corn tortilla cups with scrambled eggs and three separate toppings  beans  green chili and red chili   ill get  that again once i finished cycling through the other things i want to try  lemon ricotta pancake is to die for   seriously  the appleisous pancake  apple and cinnamon  also terrific   but order just the single pancake  only  6 00   as each pancake is enormous    neighboring tables had healthy looking bloody marys  but im not a fan of cold tomato juice   if you like breakfast or brunch this is the place 
happy hour at wildfish a nice way to do it    2 off drinks  about  3  5 off a number of small plates and appetizers  and a few entrees   the calamari appetizers is my favorite anyplace   too large for one unless you treat it as an entree  lots of nice fried calamari  rice noodles  julienne veggies with a nice  moderately spicy sauce   salad selections at happy hour also terrific   apple and greens and a nice shrimp salad  my wife enjoyed her two fish tacos   you can order off main menu as well  and do we shared lobster bisque   very good  only ordering off the happy menu  plus bisque  was plenty of food  especially with the bread basket 
chapalas is a great mexican restaurant  the staff are very friendly and welcoming upon arrival  the seating is very good and there is enough space that you do not feel cramped  my family and i usually go on sundays when they have the buffet  the food is always fresh and they are quick to restock if an item is low  generally  buffet food is something left to be desired  but not at chapalas  my family and i will keep coming here as long as it is open  i definitely recommend this restaurant 
giovanny and his uncle eliseo did a great job on my truck today  they worked with me on scheduling the right time to stop by my house and spent about an hour and half making the truck was perfect  this was my first time trying this service and im extremely content with them  i will continue to come to them in the future 
im sorry  i have to give this place a 1 star  server sucks   waiting on our food and they already gave us our check  never coming here again  i am only going to sushi mon on sahara where they have better customer service there 
ive been taking my car here since i moved to arizona 2 years ago   they are knowledgeable  friendly and fair   ive been very satisfied with the service i received   id definitely recommend them 
i went in for and met the dr  very  very briefly  we decided not to do anything  i still got a bill  i dont recommend going here 
i love scottsdale cat clinic because they love  care for and listen to my kitty as much as i do  they are easy to get into for an appointment whenever you need one   then from the moment you arrive they are thinking of your cat  when you walk in the atmosphere is calm  the welcome staff greets my cat by name  they have a candle in the front that they light if someone has recently had to put down a cat  indicating that guests should be quite in this hard time  and they have a very charming rescue welcome kitty   then once you go back into the rooms there are climbing structures on the walls of the exam rooms  which are totally clean despite my cat leaving most of her hair behind each time we go  the staff is so friendly toward my cat and listens to her  gives her time to explore before starting their exam and listens to all my crazy cat mom concerns  they help with anything that has been going on with my kitty and help plan for any changes that might be coming in her life  honestly i couldnt imagine a better vet for my sometimes anxious cat and am so thankful i found scottsdale cat clinic 
great experience  prompt response  easy communication  no delay   junior is a man of his word and gets the job done  no hassle   very happy will use again   again   
nothing special here  the best items may be therebagels  even one of our favorites outside the airport  chelseas kitchen is weak  breakfast here was a disaster   oh i forgot to mention zinc  that would receive 4 stars here  but everything else average to below average 
i use to love this place until they changed and limited the menu  no more 4 cheese mac and cheese  no more french dip  no more mike w  my wife and i walked out 
my husband and i had a great experience here tonight  we got a groupon and decided to use it  as a celiac  im always looking for restaurants with good gluten free choices  this restaurant has tons of gf options  i ordered gluten free cheese pizza and my husband ordered cheese tortellini  both dishes were very good and the service was super fast  the place was fairly busy for a sunday night   every table wasnt full but over half were  we also ordered the sweet potato fries because i wanted to taste their version  the wine pour was generous  will definitely be going back  i want to try their gf pastas next time 
this is the guy you want doing your plumbing  nick has done several jobs for me and at better prices than other companies  nick is very straight forward and informative about all things plumbing  use this company 
i love the the gilbert farmers market   the quality of the vendors is awesome   we have favorite items that we return to purchase on a regular basis   try the pasta sauces  the white chocolate peanut butter  and the pepper jams 
i have been living in the valley for over 20 years and i can confidently say that shaw butte barbers are the best in the business  they are on the quiet side  which i love  but man they are great at what they do  do yourself a favor and purchase the shave as well  you will thank me later 
i just order a gr  carml frappe with extra carml on the cup  the staff was all over the place spilling coffee  with other ppl orders and moving way to fast not taking there time to get each order right  i would not ever go back to that starbucks again and not recommend any friends or family to go there either 
wow    if youre looking for a deal when you go to vegas you should look someplace else  this place might be cheap but its totally not worth it       the room we stayed in looked like it came straight out of a florida condo in the 1980s without ever being updated  bleached out wood  faded wallpaper  stains on the bathroom wallpaper  etc  to top that off  there was a room s  down the hall from us and every time we walked past it reeked of weed    when we checked in the lady said they didnt have the room we requested  2 beds  nonsmoking  so we requested a king room nonsmoking instead  when we got up to the room what did we have  a two bed smoking room  really     service was awful  the lobby was gross  the pool was unimpressive  the shows at the hotel were lame    really just stay somewhere else  also  dont try circus circus  its right across the street  i would do my best to stay south of encore  if you need a cheap place try the flamingo  it also could use some work and needs to be updated but the pool is nice and everything seemed head and shoulders above yucky riviera    
im sitting in the lobby as im doing my review  i just met with one of the employees and we went over my service and pricing  im surprised that rotating my tires is not included in the service and they charge  19 99 for it  most places include that with the oil change service  the service was  80 99 for a full synthetic and it doesnt include rotating my dang tires for free   i did like that i didnt have to wait forever for my service to get started  theyre working on my car  its not busy  maybe because they charge  80 for an oil change   possibly    maybe that should have been  my sign when i came in  as we were going over my services  of course he goes over all the things he recommends for my car  i dont think id come back here  i dont mind paying a tad more for service but i at least expect certain services to be included  like most places include roaring tires   whats the difference between jiffy lube and francis and sons or something  at least i get a car wash at francis  right    i feel like even if i went to the dealership  i would have paid less  as for positive feedback  they were really nice  mitchell was friendly and personable 
i went here for a first date  the place is a tad small and youd miss it you driving down the street trying to look for it  look for the van  youll see it  ha    its small and dimmed light inside  its really cute  we ordered a pizza and our server was really nice and kept our waters full  which in my eyes is legit  i feel like most places forget about you when all you want is some hydration with your meal    anyways  we got our pizza and bam  it was delicious  ive never gone to here before  but ill definitely come back and try their other pizzas 
just  amazing  tacos  first time coming here and will not be the last  tacos are priced great  everything tasted great and fresh  you will not be disappointed with your visit 
forget the overpriced vegas buffets  if you love sushi  youll love this place  for an ayce  the quality is good  wide selections  ayce lunch  1 5 hour time limit  is only  20  make sure you try these rolls  man whore  wet dreams  oh my  harry  must go sushi place in las vegas 
this place has always had fantastic food  but the recent order was not very good  i ordered delivery for my birthday and the sweet and sour did not come with any sauce  just fried veg and fried pork   the teriyaki was very chewy and really salty  i could not eat it   i splurged and also got some ribs   i am sad to say most of the dishes with meat tasted  off   a pungent after taste and i am pretty sure that it was not the seasoning  the slight ammonia aftertaste    well   i am disappointed  usually i have received fantastic food  i am now wondering if they have a new cook  it was a little upsetting to go to sleep on my birthday hungry and alot of food in the fridge that was not good 
not handicap friendly   i have been going here for the past year  at times it has grumpy employees and questionable people there but the prices are low  its not bad all the time and some employees are nice   today was a humiliating day  the guy at the front of the door  he would not let me take my cart to my car  actually put himself between the cart and door  i showed him my receipts for the stuff then he told me  i cant let you go out with out someone   and started to tell me that someone has been hit in scottsdale or that i might get  hurt    i thought he was joking so i told him im tired and just not going to deal with it  while i was saying that tons of people were going out and did not have to have an escort  i told him that hes got to be kidding and that i never had someone escort me to my car  he said that this was a permanent change and that the handicap carts are not allowed outside too  i started to get upset by this time and said that i am going  he just grabbed my cart and started to roll me back   people were starting at me and he continued to talk to me like i was helpless   i felt like my disability was being displayed for everyone to see   just seconds before i left he was talking to this lady on some benches out front and she wanted my cart   huh  she asked me if i could bring my cart back inside so she could use it   i told her that i was not doing that and there were plenty of carts for her   that is when he came up beside me and told me  i could not leave and then proceed to block me from leaving   finally a cart guy came to escort me out to my car and i told him what happened   he said that there was no rule where you need to bring back your carts and that people walk out all the time with them  i suspected that because i have a cane and also have come often with my walker i was picked out   either that this guy is getting on a power trip   i called back three times to talk to a store manager and was put on hold over 10 minutes before i hung up   never coming back   rather go to the neighborhood walmart on 51st ave and olive   never had a problem with anything there 
finally a place with good food and great service  very clean  people are actually nice too you  order your food and get your drink  sit down and they bring your order and condiments to you  very pleasant people  always cleaning and helpful    fries are freshly made  burger is delicious  glad i found this place  not like the other burger places where they are rude  im impressed 
geez  mike d  tmi  tmi  but i guess its good information for the x chromosome  but do guys really care how clean your bathroom is or how tightly the door closes    okay  i digress  well  mike d  the y  bathroom was just fine  not fancy but clean   and the door closes   sorry folks for the banter before i write about the food and service   our group was running ragnar and we came in here looking for a warm and hearty breakfast  i think the state we were in  anything would have tasted out of this world  and it did  service was friendly  helpful  the food came out fast  the price extremely reasonable   i love places like the wagon wheel where the moment you walk in  they treat you like an old friend regardless of how you look  dress  or smell   not only do you get a great serving of food  you get a great serving of human decency as well  and thats worth any price and im sure thats one of many reasons why they have many regulars   it was my first and only time here but i reckon places like these has its regulars and loyal following since i know if i lived close by  this place would be my regular go to place for breakfast 
jennifer  jennifer how wonderful are thee  i might be dating myself when i disclose that ive had the pleasure of eating jennifers cooking when she was starting out in catering  at least  i think its the same jennifer  her food was scrumptious then as it is scrumptious now  and creative  and fresh   the location is a bit hard to find but once in  the interior is delightful    i hope her place success because of the location and she starts to have loyal costumer and a cult following  the kind of place that spreads by word of mouth and people from the neighborhood who become regulars there all know each other one way or another  a bit of a friends place   just by chance  when irene v  and i were there  jennifer herself was there giving an interview to new times  ever friendly yelpers we introduced ourselves and jennifer was equally friendly to us   we had ordered the charcuterie nosh board to share and she generously gifted us with an order of her famous roasted pork cuban sandwich which we furiously said she didnt have to  but i mean  were yelpers and we love food  so once arrived  we helpfully enjoyed the sandwich  exclaiming over the robust flavor  even without the unexpected gift  i would still write a 5 star review as like i had previously written  i loved jennifers food when she was strictly a caterer  back then she had said she wanted to have a restaurant and i am happy for her her dream has come true  and i wish her many years of continued success 
the ambiance and calm attitude of the staff and place sets the tone  very chill and relaxing    the green tea is superb  we had the twin dragon  spicy tuna  crunchy tuna and volcano rolls    the volcano roll was amazing    the edamame came with a sweet chili sauce that was absolutely the best  very smooth and the heat is just right    service was great 
lived here for 19 years and just found this place    great local vegas find    totally recommend   
very poor customer service       the staff is too concerned about selling you a tux and have no ability to listen to the customer     very disappointed    asked about rental tux and the sales person sales was completely inept     
wow what a great hospital    they picked up my mom and directly admitted her    no er wait     the staff was caring and super accommodating      the doctors were amazing     totally recommend      what a great place    
the staff was friendly but the lobster was waaaay over cooked  it literally felt like chewing rubber bands  if the name is lobster me      theres really no room for error on a lobster roll seeing as its the main attraction  i had chowder fries they were awesome  i wouldnt return due to the over cooked lobster  they got two stars because the staff was super nice 
cool little bar  on eric vs review we got a burger and it was excellent        yelp wants me to write more so i will   we came here the night before a browns game and had a great time 
i took map 9  im in map 12 and i have a personal coach from se5   theyve definitely helped me with my results   thanks denise  patricia and all the coaches 
michael  the owner  is a truly upstanding guy   ive done business with him and hes helped me improve my business and made a difference in my companys bottom line 
i only come to vegas for this place and this location   i have not ever been to the other one but dont want to risk my shrimp basket being prepared different     love this place and our server was fantastic   i cant remember her name  but she was a sweety   wrote huge happy birthday and thank you on our bill and circled the gratuity that was charged to us   we had no problem    she was great   
the dumpling festivities continue but this time in toronto  we were beside dumpling house after our foot massage so it would have been irresponsible not to stop in for a few bites   love how you can see the dumplings being made fresh from outside the window  theres three of them working like little bees non stop   while we waited for a table inside  we got to watch the open kitchen do their thing  its small  cramped but they make it work  the wait was only about 10 minutes      green onion pancake   50    4 99    simple but delicious  sometimes simple and fresh is best although the pancake was pretty greasy     wonton soup   87    5 99    broth was excellent and the wontons were even better  small but packed full of flavour     lamb meat dumplings   8    8 59    you get 15 steamed dumplings  lamb dumplings are my favourite and these were absolutely money  the filling tasted gamey  just the way i like em  none of this subdued lamb flavour garbage     fried pork   chive dumplings   17    7 99    12 pan fried dumplings  we went with the standard pork and chive dumplings which hit the spot   everything at the dumpling house was freshly made  fast  tasty and cheap  not sure what else youd want but we were satisfied 
the last time i ate at tacos el asador was when they were in their old  cramped quarters across the street  well  theyve upgraded big time as the new place is spacious  theyve lost that hole in the wall feeling but the food is still good   the wooden picnic tables are a cute touch and its actually way bigger than i thought   lots to choose from on the menu  tacos  burritos  tostadas  enchiladas  quesadillas and pupusas  wish we had time to try the pupusa  they were great last time  soups  salads  tamales and platters round things out     birria  goat  and fish tacos   3 75 each    we got one of each but j likes her tacos crispy  i got mine soft style  which are doubled up  and obviously the better way to eat them  fish was soft and tender  goat was good too   solid spot to grab take out  have a few tacos  ill try one of their platters next 
i just had the best massage i have ever had    my husband and i went together  katona was my therapist and amy was my husbands  my back was sore  and full of knots so katona suggested we spend the hour working them out  i prefer the swedish style massage and i think this girl wrote the book on it  i will go back to katona every time  hubby said amy was amazing also  place was very clean  not a shady style massage spa  highly recommend this place 
ive never had a better massage than this one  so good and so relaxing  i called and in 1 hour she was here  and she  brought everything  needed for massage and even music  i dont remember her name but deep massage was very strong    great massage service outcall   excellent prices  than offer other mobile massage services   so recomending this mobile service 
worst service i have had in years  ordered our food and asked 4 or 5 times if it was ready  more than 40 minutes later went up to the counter asking about our order  they never sent it to the cook  asked for the manager only to realize that the woman that gave us the horrible service and never gave the cook the order  was the manager  i will never go back there  the owners are losing customers with a manager like that 
drive thru line wasnt bad tonight and they still had the attendant outside  thats a big    so the line went by pretty fast  all the food is good as usual  good to know they stay open later than the ones in my old bay area home  ill be back 
ill give it a 4 star if they can polish up some minor but can be irritating stuff  im a gold star member and im able to line bypass by ordering on the phone which i just did  but guess what  i go to the pick up station waiting on my nitro cold brews and it aint there  after a few customers i decided to ask  since they never even wondered why im waiting there  he hollers to the batista at the front end and it turns out that its on thats side  the batista hollers back that he has grande  cold brews  i ordered trenta  but i had my suspicion  when i got there  it turned out that it was my coffee  my constuctive criticism for quality improvement is to learn your sizes  have the order at the pick up side   which is where were used to  and ask the a waiting customer if they need help  it was 2pm  busy and probably lots of new baristas  so i can understand  all the other times though  service as usuall  im also glad this place is so close to home 
as an experienced yoga student  i hired lee for a private yoga session for three women on vacation in scottsdale  lee exceeded my expectations in every regard   he was professional and arrived to our appointment a few minutes early with mats and props in tow   lee helped us set up  he spoke to us individually to assess our yoga abilities and physical concerns  lee may have had a yoga sequence in his mind  but he was adaptable once we began our practice   he offered modifications and adjusted our practice as it suited us  lee has a calming spirit and a delightful disposition    lee is the embodiment of yoga principles   acceptance  breath work and paying attention to where you are now  our group represented different ages  abilities and sizes   lee led the class without judgment and let us explore the practice in a way that was meaningful to our group   he used props  offered gentle support  reminded us to breathe  etc  it was one of the best yoga classes ive experienced in my five years of practice  i felt energized after my practice with lee    if i lived in phoenix or scottsdale  i would frequently attend class with lee   i would definitely hire lee for individual yoga lessons or for private yoga lessons with a group   he has set the bar very high    finally  lee has an interesting back story about his path to physical health through yoga and nutrition   i would also hire him to guide me to leading a healthy and nutritious life 
this appears exciting  but the cupcakes were a big let down  i could taste the crisco in the icing and the cake part was too salty  a lot of fluff and nofollow through 
they need to grow their business larger  it was packed on the sunday morning and theres always a line of people waiting at the door  we were seated maybe after 20min  but once you are at a table  food arrives pretty fast  due to limited space  they dont have strollers of food like a typical dim sum place  however  you can order from the a la carte menu and there are also entrees you can order from on a different menu   the manager there was very nice and made sure everyone is taken care of even on a busy day like that   food was on par with other dim sum places ive been to  i didnt like their pepper sliced beef too much  and the congee doesnt look very appealing but tastes the same as other places  all other plates were pretty amazing 
nice interiors   every booth had an outlet to charge your electronics  attentive staff   they come to you with your drinks if you dine in  not needing to wait for your drink before you grab a seat  very welcoming and makes you feel very open to tell them how they can improve once you talk to them    they got a deal right now for  2 85 for a med  coffee with fritter which isnt bad for a snack in the afternoon 
i got my order to go and they gave alot of food  all of the dishes tastse great l  i definitely gonna comeback and order some more
i stayed here this past weekend for my bachelorette party and had a blast  i enjoyed staying in this hotel because it was clean  new  spacious and very comfy  i really love how all of us was able to stay in one suite because there are two queen beds and a large couch that can fit 2 people comfortably but than the we figured out last minute  slow moment  that the couch has a pull out bed so you can technically fit 3 people altogether  so 7 people total could fit comfortably with no problem   the bathroom is really big and clean and i also loved all the mirrors in this room   another slow moment was that we were trying to open the curtains to look at our view and was struggling and a day later we seen a remote that controlled the curtains haha  i also love how this hotel is the sister to the venetian which has a beautiful indoor mall that i really love walking through because its so pretty    this hotel is a great place to stay if you want a nice  deserving weekend of relaxation and fun  i didnt get a chance to check out the pool but i did play on a couple slot machines and its a great place to gamble if youre feeling lucky   hope your experience was  is as good as mines 
the ramen was good and flavorful  the chicken was tender and the broth was hot  my sister and i also ordered the karaage chicken was really good  it was crunchy and not dry on the inside    i had a draft beer also with my food  i really enjoyed the food and the beer  i will be back because the service was on point  and the food    i would recommend 
a smaller  cozy place  smaller menu but very gourmet like 
this is my first time staying here and my last  the parking lot is located in the back you have to walk thru the whole miracle mile mall to get to the hotel then the registration desk is down stairs and valet that is located in front of the registration desk was full  we got a non smoking rooms and it still smells like smoke  the carpet is dirty with stains  oh yeah and the closet is located in the media center so you can imagine how small it is  the only reason we pick this place  was 1 never stood here and 2 we are here to see jlo  she should be performing at the venetian instead 
the beer is good and i didnt try the food  but this place has a distinct musty smell  i cant seem to get beyond it  im sure it is from the brewing that is happening here but this place smells 
great in ca and great in az  this store met all of my expectations  helpful staff  great food and cozy stores with fun decor   if you cant find it here thats ok you can probably go without it if you really want to 
i been coming here for a long time     the washes have been good but today my wash was amazing  alejandro got down   best wash ive ever had   im very picky  i have 2 dogs that shes like crazy and he got every single hair  no one has ever   definitely recommend you guys requesting him 
if i could give zero stars  i certainly would   over the years  i have spent thousands of dollars and done several home projects using this store  as its closest to me   i purchased a swamp cooler with them 2 months ago  and it has been a nightmare ever since   normally  you would think a store would want your business  and money   but just to get them to call me back after i ordered the swamp cooler was a chore   every time i call  i get transferred several times  and have been hung up on two separate occasions   there was a problem with the install initially  and that took forever to fix  but now   two months after the install   the swamp cooler pump has stopped   i have called the store twice  first time i was transferred 3 times and hung up on ultimately by the operator   i called back and finally did get to someone who said they would contact the contractor first thing in the morning and call me back   i did not get a call  so this morning i called again  after 7 transfers  back and forth to the operator  and one more hangup by the operator  i called back and spoke to the store manager   he couldnt help me but said the person who could might be busy  so he would have her call me   no apology for being hung up on  no apology for having to call back not once but three times in two days   seemed completely unconcerned and i imagine thats because he knows there is nothing i can do   so  really the only thing i can do is use home depot in the future or find a different location of lowes and see if they are run any different than this store   i am in the customer service world myself  and this is what causes businesses to fail   people get tired of being mistreated and take their business elsewhere   
best refried beans i have ever had   big fancy restaurants dont even compare to these beans bro    
one of the best breakfasts in town  always being served  night or day  try the chicken dumplings if you dont want breakfast 
great subs  the girls were friendly and had our subs ready in no time at all  we tried this place because of the yelp reviews  they were right on 
horrible ordered the steak burrito tiny steak they cut up like for a 2 year old kid mostly all veggies steak was tasteless never going there again taco bell makes a better burrito wow not sure who wrote reviews on this place never going there again do no recommend at all and for almost 12 bucks for a burrito thought it would be good payed 12 for veggies
my a  c stopped working on july 6th  i called these guys from ad in phone book   the technician came out and told me unit was frozen and needed freon   he put 6 lbs in the unit and told me it had a leak and probably wouldnt last  this was as i was writing the check for  479      the unit stopped working the next day   i called them back out   this time a different technician told me i needed new coils and it would be  3300    and take several weeks for delivery     i called another company and a technician came out and said the leak was so bad he could hear it and they should not have put freon in   it s against the law   how can arizona refrigeration svc be an environmentally friendly company when they intentionally and knowingly do something that is wrong   i am requesting my  479 back and have another company putting in a brand new unit today so i dont have to be a victim again    they should have just been honest up front instead of trying to get more money from me 
cheap all you can eat sushi that is located off the strip  i went to lunch with my gfs and saw that this place had decent reviews  the cool part is that the entire group does not have to order all you can eat  but the person eating a la cart cannot eat share food from people doing all you can eat  the menu is very extensive  i wish i had more people with me when i visited this place  i stuck to the nigiri especially the salmon  albacore  and yellowtail  there was also baked mussels which were pretty good and tried out the seaweed  you can also order dessert from the all you can eat menu and i got the green tea ice cream  yum    overall not bad for the price you pay at an all you can eat sushi  the service though was painfully slow  i felt like i had to order in big batches to makes sure i got everything in time  i would suggest that if you come to visit that youre not rushing because then you cant enjoy the food as much    otherwise  would definitely stop by again if not in a time crunch  service was ok  i think we had like 3 different servers  so they would keep mixing up our orders 
love this buffet  they even had mimosa and champagne  overall the food was ok for brunch  we came here versus going to bacchanal because it was on our way back to cali and the line wasnt super duper long  love it  service was pretty good  but it took awhile for us to get seated and get our drinks ordered  otherwise  the extensive array of food made it almost impossible to try everything  for the most part the food was good  i really enjoyed the beef roast  the pad thai  their sesame chicken  the dessert section was delicious  they had creme brulee  an assortment of mousses  and tiramisu  which i enjoyed the most  the creme brulee was also super yummy  and my friend  who is a fan of flan  said it was probably one of the best flans shes tasted  again  im not a fan of flan  but anyone who is  may want to definitely come try it  gelatto was also delicious  but less creamy than the ones ive tasted  i liked the pistachio flavor the most only because they had small bits of real pistachio in it   they even had a bar where you can order champagne and wine  i got the mimosa  and it was a bit strong for me  luckily i just diluted i with more orange juice  to order drinks  just bring your id over  great thing about this place is that you can go to the restroom and come back  the workers dont say anything to people coming and going   for me i would rather go at night then in the day  we pay  40 per person for the brunch menu  but i feel like there could have been more of an assortment of seafood  the only thing i really enjoyed seafood wise were the mussels with the mayonnaise  everything else was mediocre for me 
so happy this place is in the airport   my husband and i stopped in before a flight  he had the turkey reuben and i had the cobb salad  i substituted the red wine vinegar dressing instead of the dressing it comes with and we shared pork fries  everything was fresh and flavorful 
hands down best salon i have been to  great price for a cut and highlights and the color comes out great every time  the staff are talented and listen tho their clients requests  looking forward to my next visit 
i couldnt tell how there food was because they dont answer the phone   lots of good reviews but im not sure what kind of business doesnt answer the phone   if youre intereseted in staying in business  might be a good idea 
i was having issues with water coming out of the a  c improperly    after looking at the reviews on yelp i gave this local tempe company a shot  and boy   i am glad i did   after speaking to lisa on the phone she had someone had my house first thing in the morning     the tech showed up on time and was an overall nice guy     he diagnosed my problem pretty quickly and was done before i knew it     my only charge was the service call which was very reasonable  for about 45 60 min worth of work     i highly recommend this local company and will not hesitate to call them again if needed  
well after hearing about twin peaks up in scottsdale i decided to check it out down in the biltmore area   i must say what a waste of time   the food was barely average and the idea that the girls that work there are  hot  is really subjective   i suppose waitresses that are barely one step up from a strip club could appeal to some   i say save your time and money and go to the tilted kilt   much classier place 
finally a ramen house on this side of henderson  this is my new fav so delicious and service is great
love this place never can decide with a wife menu but had a great time and loved the food
ive stayed in vegas several time but this time was special   i was getting married  pros  fast check in young  hip crowd good food and shopping good vibe good room rate  cons  waaaaay too smokey billing issues front desk rude upon check out  when i researched pricing these rooms had a great price point   i was under the impression that the rooms would be a lot better than they were   our room was dark and housekeeping forgot to dust   not just in our room but our friends across the hall had an inch of dust on their table as well   when i visited another friends room i thought she requested non smoking but could smell smoke like someone was smoking in the next room   when i got back to my room the same this was happening   although we had non smoking rooms the smoke must be cycling thru the vents   i came back home with a monster of a  sinus infection from all the smoke   when i checked in i paid the balance on my room and received my receipt   when i checked out rahman argued me down saying my balance was  144 and some odd change   i explained to him that my room balance was paid   not to mention when i made the reservation for 5 rooms they charged all 5 rooms to my card causing me to have insufficient funds fees   i was told nothing would be charged to hold those rooms   after talking with billing they refunded all of my money   i guess they had to listen to the conversation i had with the person i spoke with when i made the reservation   she told me nothing would be charged    with all the billing issues and the smoke factor i would not stay here again or recommend anyone else to stay here 
this was a cheap and very cheerful hotel  we ate in the hotel restaurant the first night but we didnt have a great choice as we dont eat meat and the germans are well known for their love of meat  the staff were extremely helpful and although our room was basic  it was very comfortable  the second night we ate in a nearby indian restaurant  beware if you are an indian lover because curry houses here as so different from ours at home  the reason we ate here was because we wanted a good vegetarian choice  the menu had a lot more meat on it than we have in england and we were still quite restricted  a good weekend though  we would definitely go back again 
i must say  the food was very good  when it arrived but  the wait time for the appetizers extended into the main course   i think they may need to hire more cooks or something     the menus look like they havent been replaced in a good long time   the server was personable and friendly   nice guy   id recommend it 
love caesars palace and the forum shops here  they have fendi  louis vuitton  balenciaga  salvatore ferragamo under one roof  not only do they have four star shops and four star restaurants here they have an awesome show at the were those greek statutes move and talk and at the end do that pyro fire thingy  i love shows and performances so this definitely entertained me  lol 
dr  kirmani is really nice but her front staff always loses everything  weve been there 3 times within the last 6 month no change in insurance yet they always have to ask for kids insurance cards and social security numbers everything you normally only do on your 1st visit  which always delays us 30 45 min from getting to see the doctor each time 
this a great option for me because its right by my house and the service is always quick  i used to get the burritos but i usually end up not eating it all  the three tacos are a much better option and they dont leave me feeling stuffed  which is a good thing  the staff is always very friendly and i am in and out quickly  love the online ordering too 
best boba place in town  they have a unique way to make boba and a variety of flavor of to choose besides milk tea  they even serve slushies which come in so many flavor  my favorite is the taro oreo slushie  you can even adjust how much ice to put  the sweetness  and even how much milk to put it  the prices are a bit high but its worth it to get the best boba place in town 
worst meal ever  went here for a quick sandwich before going out to the bars  took almost 30 minutes to bring our food  i had a grilled sandwich wrap  it was so soggy i only are the chicken out of it since i was so hungry  fries were ok but salty  all my friends had sandwiches or wraps and did not like theirs either  was not worth the money  the music was good if you like country and they do have a dance floor but would not recommend the food 
one of my favorite places in the valley for breakfast   the service is always fast and friendly   biscuits and gravy are awesome    chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak are great as well 
this is my first ever yelp review at my first ever yelp event      that said  i had one of the most wonderful culinary adventures of my life    i even tried certain foods and products for the first time ever and i must say that i am now a fan      highlights would have to be      poke guys    my first time ever trying the new poke bowl craze and i am now truly a big fan   the bowl i had that night was truly da bomb   a great marriage of flavours  textures and harmony in each and every bite   pokeguysto   shanee    this thai vendor had the seasoned pork dish with taro root chips    although i dont eat pork  the taro root chips were very tasty and make a great alternative to the potato or corn tortilla chip     i may consider finding a way to score a take home bag for future enjoyment   shaneeto  h cafe    first time trying the ever popular japanese cheesecake    i love the lightness  balanced take of cheesecake that leaves you satisfied without feeling heavy when eating your regular cheesecake     hcafeto    junked food company     my second time trying raw cookie dough and i must say that i am now a believer in this new trend    it is a much safer preparation without the eggs and the flour is treated beforehand     junkedfoodto  just craft soda     i tried the lemon  lemongrass and apple  ginger sodas and i must say that upon having these sodas  i really dont want to go back to mass produced sodas ever again    heres hoping that a new revolution starts for companies like just craft soda to market all natural  organic and healthy drinks that can be tasty and fun   justcraftsoda  food dudes    upon trying their salted caramel milk chocolate chip cookies i think i can say that this could be one of the top chocolate chip cookies in the city      thefooddudesto     this was a very impressive event filled with amazing vendors and i am looking forward to participating in the toronto yelp community for a long time 
great place to watch sports events and have some serious bar food and great beers   great service and happy asu crowd   enjoyed my first visit while in phoenix and looking forward to going back next time i am in town 
stick to the basics on their menu  dont get fancy   otherwise youll be disappointed  i got the oyster po boy and maybe they were canned but the were as chewy as bubble gum  my wife got ceviche which also disappointed  very ambitious menu   but  bad execution 
great location on the north end of the scottsdale greenbelt  unfortunately the food is average at best  bathrooms smell and are unkept  the female bartending staff  especially tommi  is arrogant and slow   the male bartenders pick up the slack   lame for a packer bar 
ive gotten 3 meals delivered to my house including breakfast on a weekday morning and they were all delicious 
although i usually get scared off by any restaurant belonging to a chain  st  louis is quite decent  i ordered the honey garlic wings meal  and it was delicious  definitely one of the better wings places ive been to  i would say the pricing was about average   the atmosphere    well  it definitely wasnt my kind of scene  but some may like it  i was here when a jays game was going on  so the place was noisy and crowded with sports fans wearing jerseys and caps  if i was there to see a game and wanted to grab a bite to eat with some friends  id probably come back  otherwise  i prefer to go somewhere a bit quieter where i can just chill out and actually hear the people im with 
disclaimer  im not a car expert and all i got was an oil change  but ill definitely be coming back and will update my review accordingly   i was helped by wayne  the owner  and he was extremely friendly  i find other mechanics can have a tendency to talk to you like youre a moron  in fact  the mechanic next door did just this when i spoke to him about an oil change first  but wayne was friendly through and through   wayne made it clear to me that they would do the oil change  and if i wanted  they would check for any other problems  i said i only wanted the oil change today as i had to leave for oshawa soon  and that was that   my car was done in a timely fashion and as the previous reviewer said  i did not feel ripped off or have any issues with the work   again  do keep in mind i just got an oil change  but for the price i paid and the vibe i got at the place  ill certainly be coming back here 
i love coming here to grab dinner or lunch  this is also my default place to bring picky guests from out of town  hawaii for a delicious dinner off the strip  they have tasty pork cutlets  salmon cutlets  and huge prawns  most dishes come with a huge pile of shredded cabbage salad  miso soup  and pickles 
come for the cheap  tasty lunch and late night dining specials  dont expect friendly smiles or service  order the salt and pepper pork chops  string beans  crispy chow mein  and tofu hot pot  leave happily stuffed and repeat 
my boyfriend eats here often  im not a big pizza or calzone fan like him  but i love a meatball sub  i came here tonight cuz the subway next door was closed  i didnt realize i could get such a bettrr sandwich next door  and they were open late  totally  recommend 
we did like guss  but our last two visits were poor  tonights visit terrible  we didnt get the food or beer we ordered  the pirogis were tasteless  the dining room cold because the staff left the back door open  the place want staffed properly  only one server  who likely was stoned  and had no idea of how to operate the computer ordering system  how do you staff a restaurant like this  we were so happy to have a neighborhood restaurant  and gluten free  open like this  but id say one more bad dinner and we will be done 
dont be fooled by the newly renovated outside of this building  they tried to make it look like a more serious restaurant  complete w  a sign that states   serious bbq    but it is over priced and laughable at best   i had been here before and it was ok  because it was a novelty and one visit was late night   pigglys has nowhere near the quality of food found elsewhere  especially when it comes to bbq    their  fair food  menu and fried offerings are ok  if thats your thing   the place was pretty dead when we came late afternoon  except for the bar area  where a major nfl play off was airing  it took rather a long time to get our food  and the small tray of complimentary cornbread wasnt that great  by the time our food finally came  i had given up trying to find decent greens  etc  from the salad bar  and was very disappointed in the dressing there as well   my husbands pulled pork sandwich was passable  though  as he put it  they didnt lose any money on the extremely small portion of coleslaw that came on the sandwich  and the potato salad was nothing to write home about   i unwisely chose the prime rib special  the meat wasnt tough  but wasnt overly flavorful  the good flavor that usually comes from the fat was negated by its lukewarm ness  the  mashed reds  came smothered in white gravy  not mentioned on the menu  nor alluded to by the waitress   had tough skin bits in them and were pretty bland   add to this that my meal continued to plague me the rest of the day and evening  something that is totally unusual for me   and you will conclude that we are not happy campers  nor will we visit this establishment again  there is a reason the parking lot wasnt busy  i dont mind paying for good food  but i hate paying a high price for bad food and its residual effects  ugh  shoulda stuck with soup and salad at charlestons instead   
great place to do your taxes  definitely recommend coming here  friendly   great service   plus no long wait   
foot reflexology was done by a lady with sharp nails  terrible experience  dont come here  very unprofessional and unethical 
open 24  7 365  convenient location with ample parking    since this location is open 24  7 this is actually one of the few walgreens whose pharmacy is actually open 24  7   so when its 6 30am and you need some behind the counter cold medicine  look no further  compared to cvs down the road whose pharmacy closes early and isnt open 24  7 
ive passed by chinato many a times down east 4th during lunch and have never stopped in   ive always assumed it was a little too pricy and stuffy for lunch   however i was most pleasantly surprised when i stopped in with some work colleagues recently   the service was top notch by our waitress lisa and the rest of the front of house staff   lisa checked on us multiple times  our drinks never went empty and our plates where never left empty on the table too long   our meals came came out promptly and piping hot   my risotto was delicious and the lunchtime portion was shocking large   my colleagues ordered the chicken scaloppini and the braised beef   both were bites i tried were fantastic   i will be for sure coming back for lunch again   the prices for each of our meals averaged to about  20 a piece and frankly that was a steal for the service that we received and the huge portions presented to us 
great build your own tacos   a good place to stop at lunch on fridays  after work for happy hour  half priced margs    and for late night eats after a concert or game    dinner times on weekends tend to have waits but you can order drinks at the bar while you wait    some recommendation   stoner queso   omg so tasty  stoner taco  greek goddess taco  chorizo on anything  coke cola marinated beef  new item   apple jicama slaw   tasty   pickled peppers  blood orange margaritas  also good gluten free options  low carb options  vegetarian options and paleo options  you can get corn tacos  flour tacos  bowls with and without rice and tofu  black bean   portobello mushrooms for your protein if your a vegetarian or vegan 
this restaurant is situated in a fairly deserted part of prospect   not quite in playhouse square but not quite near east 9th   that said  the restaurant decor was very modern with a jazz lounge vibe in the front with a beauty fire place and decently sized bar   there are a few booths around the perimeter but a lot of 4 tops through the center of the room which make it extremely crowded and hard to maneuver     with those things in mind i was an expecting a great experience and awesome food  what i got didnt quite live up to that  in any new restaurant i expect a nominal level of kinks that need to be worked out  hostess greetings  waitstaff timings and responses  food timings slightly slower   this was all expected and received  what i didnt expect was the mediocre food  and maybe i ordered wrong but this seemed to be the sentiment throughout my party   i really hate to say this but i have to  the waffle was horrible   it was flat  chewy and i dont think quite cooked through   i would unfortunately have to compare it to an eggo freezer waffle   the chicken was o k  seasoned well   the corn bread was dry and neither sweet nor savory  i had quite the difficulty cutting it open to butter which maybe says something  the grits were o k as well  we went with cheddar and it seems that the grits werent quite cooked slow enough or long enough to get that creamy texture naturally without the help of the cheese   overall i understand this restaurant is new and maybe i went on an off day   but when you are just opening and competing with dozens of other restaurants in the downtown cleveland area for a lunch crowd  first impressions count a lot more   i might pop in again in a couple months to see if anything has changed 
my boyfriend swears that this place was awesome a few years ago  i wish i could say the same for it today  we live really close by and i so wanted this place to be awesome  after trying it on 3 separate occasions  i have just given up  the staff is always dragging around  as if youre a big bother  it seems like theyre friendly to the bar patrons but  anyone else is just an irritant  the first time we ate here  they forgot my daughters meal and when we asked about it she said  oh  do you still want it    i could go on and on about a slew of mini issues that all add up to crappy  you always have to ask for more drinks  even water  they never clear your table when bringing you fresh glasses  just leaving the old ones to clutter  the food is usually kind of gross or at best  completely forgettable  i could almost put up with lame food as long as the staff is friendly  or at least kind of cordial  the cuisine is overpriced for what it is  terrible   im serious when i say that the carls junior down the street has better service  fresher food and a cheaper menu  just my  0 02
i cant count how many times the streetcar driver has driven away from me while im running and i swear they are smirking while doing so  they will slam on breaks or pump the breaks so all of us standing are humping eachother like dogs in heat  an old lady has fallen off the bus into the curb because they didnt lower the ramp  i have seen someone get nailed by the bus mirror  its ridiculous  today i was smashed by the door getting on at keele and st clair  i was the only one on the streetcar   like are we in a race to get somewhere   wait for me to get up in the streetcar its not like im slow  i fave two stars because he offered a sorry  on streetcar number 4028  but regardless this isnt a review for the ttc in general because normally i have some pretty good drivers and theyre courteous and some are just super grumpy and dont say anything when i say thank you  mind you you cant go through life expecting kindness from everyone 
this location has all the brands banana offers and has two floors of womens and mens clothing  the staff are so great here  i feel like the three women are my best friends with how they compliment and offer advice or helping to find exactly what im looking for  theyre chatty and make you feel at ease  the store is clean and well laid out  never a wait for the change room  good lighting  of course amazing location right outside bay and they seem to always have 30 40 off on wednesdays  thursdays   i get a student discount of 10  and sometimes another 10 through virgin mobile so dont forget to at least ask  
from the street this place looks tiny  but make your way down the stairs inside or the  slightly  rickety metal steps down from george iv bridge and youll find an elegant dining room where they serve one of the best lunch deals in edinburgh  a starter  mains  and two sides for about seven quid     the food is upmarket without being pretentious  and if i cant speak of their desserts that at least tells you the portions are more than hearty and didnt leave any room to try them  my companion qualified her starter of tomato and basil soup as pretty much a meal in itself     very good service too in formal yet relaxed surroundings  dont watch the large clock on the wall and let your lunch hour go   
the food here is subtle  unpretentious  and above all  very good  i recommend the roast aubergine dip from the starters and the moussaka  but you cant go wrong with the houmous and chicken kebab either     for some reason they always have on as background music a french internet radio station that plays a mix of classical and jazz  which is eclectic but pleasant     definitely worth returning to regularly 
i took my boys to gene woods in december    we drove from walnut creek to vegas  and i bought the coupon from groupon as a stocking stuffer   this place was amazing     such a great experience  the go kart were bigger than the boys   then 14 15 years  thought and they go fast   they had so much time to race    the staff was wonderful and even took my camera out in the middle and photographed them    i tipped the guy 20 because they spent the time  went above and beyond   this was a perfect experience for my boys    we were not rushed and they will remember this forever      i grew up by long beach  washington so my boys had always rode the go karts in long beach growing up when they visited grandma    gene woods  outdoor not indoor  was hundreds times better  bigger and faster       thanks linette  dillon and kurren 
working with dr  yeung was a life changing experience  prior to my surgery  i suffered from chronic neck pain  causing shooting pains up and down my arms  i was unable to spend time with my family the way that i wanted due to the constant pain  now that i have had the surgery  i feel like me again  my family and i truly thank dr  yeung for his help  i would highly recommend his services 
thankfully  everything worked out fine but this place is terribly unethical   the lines were so long after a long flight and we were given a mid sized car instead of full sized and they would not budge on the fact that it wasnt what we ordered  paid for   since i knew i could fit the carseats in the car and just wanted to get the hell out of there  i let it go   they also did the hard sell on insurance   this isnt the typical sell though of comprehensive  they want to add  23 a day to cover the time the vehicle would be unavailable to rent should damage occur  so  not for the actual damage  i imagine they would charge even more for actual insurance  which we always decline    we took the risk and declined it all  but i can only imagine what dealing with them would be like should something have happened to the car   we were willing to risk it since we really had double coverage  our credit card offers rental car insurance and our auto insurance also covers us  but the clerk was incredibly rude  the car isnt what was promised  and the hard sell was really terrible   they also dont allow a second driver for no cost like most places do so my husband was stuck driving the entire trip or wed pay another  10 a day   oh  and our car clearly needed new brakes  they shook like crazy the entire trip   lovely   never again 
which which is really high quality  they probably make the tastiest subs in town  i havent had erbert and gerberts  so i cant say for certain   they definitely have a far better crab meat sub than subway  the prices are a little higher than i would pay for the amount you get  like the other reviews say  i dont really get subs often enough to care  but if you frequent sub shops it might be enough to deter you   i would give which which a five star  but every time i eat here my stomach gets a litte upset  every single time  its really unfortunate  considering how tasty it is  my boyfriend has the same issue and he usually gets the tuna  neither of us have tried anything other than fish  so maybe its an issue with that  i wish they would fix whatever the problem is  theyre so good i still end up getting a sub every other month or so and dealing with the upset stomach 
waiting time was 3 hours but  then again it  was the 4th of july angel hair pasta was very salty  notified our waitress she just apologized  my son had the chicken piccata and was so salty as well tell your waitress to make sure pasta is not salty utensils were all dirty including my plate overall food and portion is always great here
great food for the money  good service and family friendly   check out the happy hour specials    worth the visit    we went with our three young kids  the staff and manager did a nice job keeping everyone entertained  a regular stop for us when we go to the q  with or without kids  
i went to 4 stadiums this year for spring training and this one was the worst   old  no food choices  bad beer selection  poor service they could not handle the crowd the giants brought you could not buy food and they actually ran out of food   also there is no grass and most seats are in the hot sun as there is very little shade and they charge for parking   go to any of the other stadiums for a great venue  shade  food choices  good beer etc   passing on this one next time 
pete is amazing  he works on all my foreign cars and i have never had any issues with him or his work  he knows what hes doing and explains the problems well  hell even take me back and show me what hes looking at so i know im not being scammed  ill continue to take my cars to him  he uses oem parts and charges way less than the stealerships  thanks pete 
this is the worst review i have had to write  it was my last night in toronto  and i regret having my last dinner at this place  the food wasnt aweful  but the experience was a complete bust  my rating is mostly based on service and false advertisement  dont expect good service here if youre not chinese   ordered the beef pancake  which i enjoyed  also got the clams which werent half bad  i was mostly disappointed by the smoked meat in alms bowl because the smoked meat was just cut up bacon and looked nothing like the meat in the picture  also  the clams were advertised at 11 99  but when the check came it was 15 99  i generally dont mind paying more for good food  but the quality of these clams was at most worth 11 99  anyhow  there was no arguing with the staff because they seriously dont give a shit if you dont speak the language   overall  not worth it 
this is probably the second best ramen place ive ever been to  better than ippudo yo in new york  on par with many places in la  but not quite as good as my favorite ramen place in sf  waraku ramen izakaya  the tonkotsu broth was so rich  and i had mine with black garlic oil which definitely added a lot of wholesome flavor  great dish during the winter in toronto 
anyone who personally knows me  knows that i love sushi  and when i heard that a sushi burrito and poke bowl joint was opening up walking distance from my workplace  naturally i had to scope it out  ive had their classic salmon sushi  burrito twice now and each time i was not disappointed    the restaurant itself is quite small  seating at maximum about 5 6 people  if you can  its best to get take out or come during off hours    as for the main attraction  i was pleasantly surprised to see that they didnt skimp out on the toppings  the sushi burrito for me was very filling  i was only able to finish half of the burrito before saving the rest for an evening snack  there is a good amount of fish to vegetable ratio so youre not left with a mouthful of kale at every bite    overall  i will come back again to try their poke bowls based on my first two positive experiences 
daisy      did such an amazing job on my nails    she is awesome with any kind of designs    and super super nice    i love her work   they take it to next level  im a first time customer but for sure im going to be a loyal customer    love it     
nice selection on vegan options and for a self posed temporary vegan like myself you can try the tofu pot  c4  with shrimp stuffing  shitake mushroom  chinese sausage and the sweet broth of chicken  i ate all the veg part and had my friends ate all the non veg  worked out great  the chicken soup can sure warm you up  my friends also mentioned the claypot  1 with beef brisket is one of the best theyve had and trust me they r both picky eaters whove had meals in chinatown everywhere 
a group of 6 of us did the wild west room then the alien room and had an excellent time  the wild west room was my favorite  loved the number of rooms that were used and the low lighting  great for a group of our size  we escaped both rooms and cant wait to try their other rooms  staff was very nice and helpful  there was a black friday deal that was going on so thats why we stayed for the alien room too 
i go to cornish all of the time  all 3 locations  and i love all of their pasties  the food is always good and the prices cant be beat  the scottish eggs are excellent and to my surprise their salads are amazing too  make sure to leave room for dessert 
so far ive tried  s 9  10  11  of what ive tried so far   9 is my current favorite   9 has corn flakes  gives it an amazing crunch along with the taste  this was the first sushi burrito i tried at pokeman and is what really drew me in to try the others    10   eel i normally like eel but i give this one a 7  10  the eel chunks are chewy and large     11   chicken worst one so far and likely to hold  chicken has large amounts of grizzle it in and i had to spit out the meat  also no crunch to it  you wouldnt want it with chicken anyways  and had a bland overall taste 
theres no way this place is worthy of five stars  maybe the owner knows the reviewer  understocked  and more importantly no soap dispenser in the mens bathroom  how are the employees supposed to thoroughly wash their hands and go back to their amazing job of  yeah  working at walmart 
this place was a great locals spot years ago  but you can forget that now  slow service  expensive menu  and very little value during  happy hour   they also made major changes to the menu from what i remember and my favorite items are now nowhere to be found  also be wary of coming here in the evening when it gets chilly out  the entire place is basically open and it seems the  new   owners dont care to invest in proper heating elements  not friendly to gluten free either 
the customer service here was excellent  however management obviously has not trained the staff properly    the place has a general dirty feel to it  and there is really no explanation to exactly what youre ordering unless you ask the customer service representative on the other side of the counter   what was most disappointing for me is that i just basically paid seven dollars for something that would cost me no more than four dollars at dairy queen  in addition to that  upon eating my nondairy pineapple yogurt  i realized that the center was left completely void of the yogurt   so essentially  you really are only getting half of what you paid for because the center is completely empty  therefore  i cannot recommend this place   once again i dont think its a problem with the employee or employees that i dealt with but its a problem with the lack of training by management and the lack of oversight by management  this place does have potential to be successful  however i just dont see it being around for much longer if it continues down this path 
tip  order the yellowtail tar tar for sure   pros  great food  flavor you can savor and recognize  once your taste buds catch onto a taste they like  youll be back  its also fairly easy to get a seat  and i think theyre open late   cons  uncomfortable seating  they also keep your ongoing bill    check in a slot underneath your table that is quite obtrusive  is is really that hard to slap a number on the side of each table and hang them behind the register  it may be easy to get a seat  but this restaurant is also on the 2nd floor  and you need to take a scary elevator  or the stairs  handicapped people are treated to a free haunted ride of the elevator 
the food here is really hit or miss  but when you get a hit its the most delicious thing ever  the best thing here  the clam chowder for sure  ive come here just for a bowl of it  the restaurant is ok  i dont really like sitting inside and the chairs outside are terribly uncomfortable  aside from the chairs  sitting outside  listening to live performances  the ones ive heard were really good   and enjoying the scenery while it rained was quite a pleasant experience  i dont like the servers i have here  they usually dont seem to know what theyre doing  i really prefer their menu during restaurant week  ill try to stop by here next time i see them up for the event  otherwise im going to stick with the occasional visit for the chowder 
i was very drawn to this place due to my insatiable hunger for seafood  but it ended up being my downfall  everything about this place is typical except for the atmosphere and the selection  the place is a lot nicer looking and feeling than any other chinese buffet ive been to  the selection is seriously crazy  they have all the normal stuff  plus a huge selection sushi  a large variety of seafood  a few american dishes  and some authentic chinese dishes  unfortunately  i hated almost all of it  the chinese buns with red bean paste were delicious though  i tried everything  but ended up filling up on those  the sushi was dry and a little bland  a few of the specialty roles werent bad  i tried the chicken feet  that was a really interesting experience that i will not be repeating  everything was pretty average and ok until i sampled the seafood  i almost immediately felt nauseous  pretty sure i got food poisoning from something  of course none of my friends had any of it so they all keep trying to get me to go back  just the thought of it makes me queasy  i begrudgingly went back once and ate nothing but the red bean buns and potstickers  i hope to never come back here again 
maybe i dont like indian food  but i just dont like this place  my boyfriend has forced me a few times to go to the lunch buffet  the service usually sucks  we never get soda refills  one of the desserts tasted like pinesol  it was really weird and we made our friends try it because of how dead on it was 
i used to go to mermaid and thought they were ok  but then i came here  the washes are definitely way better  they do a much better job at cleaning the interior  ive never gotten anything over the  30 range  so im not really sure how the detailing is  the waiting area is really nice and comfortable  theyre usually pretty fast  but can get really clogged up during busy hours  i still end up touching up after theyre done  but i usually dont have to do much 
i really liked this sls  hotel  the valet parking was efficient  i had three large boxes of paintings and two suitcases  they brought up two clothing racks on wheels to transport them to the room  very nice and efficient  the room was very nicely decorated  there were two large mirrors facing each other with lights around the outside  their reflections created an interesting lighted tunnel effect  i had a great view of the stratosphere  i hotel its better to glimpse from afar than to stay in  the sls had large sized shampoo  conditioner and body scrub several times larger than most hotels  there was a toothbrush  sewing kit  and razor along with many other goodies that were free  there was a bar  orange juice and other snacks for purchase  i liked the fact that there were lots of little restaurants everywhere in the lobby area  the hotel was very nicely decorated  did i mention i got an upgrade 
definitely a new  untrained crew at chipotle   doesnt seem to be too many transfers of knowledgeable employees from other locations   portion sizes of protein have been extremely small and have to nudge the team for more of every ingredient   frustrating  but tasty 
tokyo house just became my favorite place for teriyaki chicken  this place has a more mapley that usual teriyaki sauce which really works with my love for sweet and savory foods  staff was extremely friendly and nice  not sure if its family owned but it sure felt like it was  this place definitely beats out kyoto bowl  yogis  and teriyaki chicken  cant wait to go back 
this is a take out review    walked here for some quick take out and it ended up taking out 45 minutes of our evening  with a puppy and an infant waiting with us for the food this made for a major inconvenience  i think  even under normal circumstances  45 is a long time to wait for food  two sandwich meals  kabob and shawarma both with salad   even if we were sitting at a table    while we were waiting we saw plenty of people come in to sit and to pick up take out  already ordered on the phone   we saw customers by pass waitresses and ask the cooks for things like soy sauce and ketchup and we saw one big group leave because they couldnt be accommodated in the dining area    the food was good  the laffa itself was very tasty  probably prepared on site   and the shawarma was excellent  the kabob was a little strange consisting of three large balls of meat  but good none the less  the salad was salad  i e  it was green    my advice  call and order ahead if you want take out  and if they dont take reservations  call and order ahead and take out 
i had high hopes at first  they advertise a sale of 50  50  50      basically half off the carpet  the padding  and the install  the salesman  estimator that came out was named chris  he was very aggressive  almost upset at the simple questions i was asking  i told him i needed 1244sqft of carpet  he said how did you get that number  i told him i measured it myself  he then said i was probably incorrect and that i would need 1500 sqft  really    without even measuring it first he is going to suggest this  im not an idiot    next i asked him how much the carpet was that we were looking at  he told me it was  4 00 a sqft installed  said that included everything  yet he said he wouldnt be able to give me a break down to show how much the carpet  padding  and install was and how much the 50  off sale made it    he was in the house for maybe 10 min and i finally kindly asked him to leave  i told him i didnt like his aggressive attitude toward my otherwise simple and straightforward questions about their product and its pricing  i have never felt such attitude from a business like this coming to give me an estimate  isnt the goal to gain my business  i guess empire has more then they need and dont really care about the customer  horrible first impression   so if you want transparency in pricing  this is not the place to go according to chris and his answers   if you want someone to come in and tell you that its going to be  4 a sqft and the total job will be  6000 without a single measurement or a realistic breakdown in price for product and services  then this is your place  good luck    i was going to reschedule an estimate with this company in hopes of someone more stable and friendlier  but ive been on hold now for 45 min  other reviews have said they dont answer the 800 number  that is my experience  i was so excited to finally get new carpet  yet now its turning into a headache 
this guy below me has probably never lived in parma   yes  parma bars blow  because parma people blow   therefore wagon wheel is at the mercy of its customers  and it does a hell of a job  besides the dj in the basement    first off  the pizza is literally the best pizza ive ever had   i promise   2nd  its only  7 for a large  there is always plenty of room  the patio is awesome  the bartenders are nice and the atmosphere tries to stay as unparma as you can possibly be north of snow rd   i love wagon wheel 
yummy food  we love the duck and spicy shrimps   our kids love their food too  place is clean and they have a great staff  we will definitely come back 
food was excellent  stuffed shells   service was attentive  prices reasonable 
their duck liver pate is a must  there is a very charming private pantry table in the back of the restaurant as well as bar seats that face the kitchen allowing you front row seats to the chefs  show    the mushroom angnolotti is amazing with swiss chard  hen of the woods mushrooms  walnut pangrattato and tamari butter  the whole dish is packed with flavor  you will not be disappointed 
i was referred to them a while back by another carrier    i went there and dealt with carl who fixed my husbands screen for cheap   he was great  i went back to purchase a iphone 5 for my daughter for christmas  he gave me a great deal and also fixed her screen for her iphone4 so i can use   he also showed us how to transfer all our information and went above and beyond what he should of done   i went back to him again yesterday because my phone went black and didnt have a phone for 2 days   carl fixed it within two minutes and didnt even charge me   i highly recommend this place   especially carl  and i wont go any where else   
meh  we live nearby and always pass this on our way to various different locations  we were very intrigued when we saw them building this where dukes station used to be  we finally had the opportunity to go when the parking lot wasnt completely filled  being that it always seemed to busy  we assumed that it must be excellent  i am very fond of various times of beers  so i was very excited to come here  i did enjoy the ipa i ordered called  killer diller  but it wasnt something i couldnt walk into a store a find  we ordered the pretzels to start with  and they were alright  the cheese was slightly below room temperature  which wasnt that appetizing  i personally orderd the hog heaven sandwich  i was tasty  but extremely greasy  leaving one of the slices of bread completely soggy  my boyfriend ordered the drunken turkey sandwich  which he was not impressed with  the place had good atmosphere and had pretty cool napkins  but we would have been extremely disappointed to have come here and had to have waited for an hour like most people have mentioned  hope they improve 
worst place  misplaced our order and gave us a chicken dish instead of a veggie dish  we are prohibited by religion from eating meat  when we informed them about it  the waiter acted very rudely and tried to laugh it off    we asked the waiter to pack the remaining food  he jokingly asked if we wanted the chicken to be packed too  we said we absolutely didnt wanted it   but  we later found out that he had packed it and put it in our bag   what shamelessness   when we talked to the manager  he removed the dish from our order and told us we wont have to pay for it  which was quite obvious   we asked for some additional discount as it had forced us to break our religions rule  they denied it and said that we talk to the senior manager  who wasnt present there    their attitude in the whole incident was of arrogance and indecency  we will never return to this restaurant 
entertaining way to get out of the heat  they had props by the wax figures to make it even more entertaining   dont forget to catch the 4d avengers movie at the end  that was also very entertaining 
the view from on top of the eiffel tower is amazing  definitely go up right before the bellagio fountains perform and you will get a spectacular view 
humungous wherehouse of any alcohol you can imagine  im in a small town in arizona and they have an original gin made in seattle  i could spend an hour or two just wandering up and down the isles looking at all the wines and liqueur  definitely give this place a go 
one word  kaisen bowl   this place is not only better than ayce because of their famous courses  but quality come from great former sushi extreme chef takashi  koji   him make authentic japanese sushi at awfully reasonable price    if you are alone or go there with a friend  try to sit at sushi bar  takashi will give you special attention and maybe a special mini dish or two  that are not on the menu and i promise you is delicous   
great  casual atmosphere with really great and reasonably priced food  visiting madison and looked for the best fried cheese curds   amazing cheese curds   perfectly fried and soft and delicious  the chips and dipping sauce are great too   they have some specials daily   i tried the chicken mediterranean club   very good  friends tried the mac and cheese and said it was fantastic also  seems like a great place to stop by for a casual bite to eat right in downtown madison 
i have eaten here a few times  and always enjoy my meal  but i have to echo the comments of the other reviewers  the service needs improvement  just recently we went on a sunday evening at around 5 30    we were fortunate in that our order went in just before a large takeout order was placed  as we watched other tables that came in after us wait for about 45 minutes to receive their food  and some even longer     we actually managed to place our order  eat  and finish before a table  which came in just shortly after us  had even received their meal  the trouble is i cant seem to figure out where the fault lies  the servers seem to have trouble even retrieving drinks for tables  while the kitchen staff seems to have trouble with large orders    i realize this is a fairly new restaurant  and maybe they are still trying to find their groove  but i hope for their sake that they find some synergy soon   also  if youre reading any of these reviews before going  i should let you know this is a fairly small restaurant  and bringing small children is probably not the best idea  we sat behind a table with small children who seemed to want to explore and roam around the restaurant  when servers are buzzing around as busy as they were last night  this is a recipe for disaster 
nothing fancy  just really good food that tastes just like youd expect it to  definitely good value for the money  definitely visit this place during the week as weekend visits are going to be crowded 
it was a good lunch place  food was tasty  not over priced   service was fast  id defiantly dine there again 
my family and i have been coming to this salon for 16 years   arras is an institution in chagrin falls  they have been here over 40 years  after this many years the staff at arras are like family  they offer the latest in hair products and techniques  the staff is beyond accommodating with their scheduling  they have a spa area as well  you will not go wrong visiting this little gem in chagrin falls 
this is the only drug store in chagrin falls  exterior  location   a brick building strip mall off main street  located next to the closed giant eagle    interior  plain and very in need of renovation  poorly lit store  tired old carpeting  if i didnt know better  id think they were waiting out their lease to close  usually not terribly organized    vibe  ambiance  i go here only if i have to  certainly not my preferred drug store  no ambiance here    staff  usually older individuals  they are always under staffed    clientele  could be anyone in the area  keep in mind  its the only drug store in downtown chagrin falls    so we all go there when we are in a pinch    price  i check out the cvs specials    must get items  i would saw get some great lipsticks or something on sale  look for the buy 1 get one 1  2 off    why i love or hate it  i wish it were more updated  the selection is adequate  nothing special 
there is nothing that special to say  its home imporvement    exterior  location  a large big box buliding on miles road  interior  sometime a bit messy  i give them credit for trying  some areas are nicer than others  vibe  ambiance  there is no vibe here   everyone is on a mission   everyone is looking for something to finish that spacial project   staff  it is impossible to have too much staff here   most do  it  yourselfers are not pros   we need all the help we can get   service is adequate   clientele   anyone and lots of trades people  price   fair  must get items  im a fan of the garden center   why i love or hate it  i love it   they usually have what i need and seem to have a higher end selection than home depot    final thoughts   there arent many choices for home improvement   its not perfect    but good enough 
exterior  location  west side ohio city  interior  small  not particularly pretty   but they have ice cream  vibe  ambiance  hip and artisanal   staff  younger kids that know and love their ice cream  clientele   anybody  price  truthfully  i didnt pay    so i didnt pay attention  must get items   maybe another flavor than the vietnamese coffee   why i love or hate it  i hate to give this place less than a stellar review  i have read so much good on yelp  so i was confused why i might be the only person who is not gushing over masons  i got a small cup of vietnamese coffee and chocolate  my ice cream seemed like it lacked cream  it tasted like ice crystals   i actually threw half of it out  maybe it had frost bite  my entire family was sort of disappointed  its tough to mess up ice cream  im not sure how they did  on a positive note  the staff was super nice and cool  they let people suggest flavors for them to create  im glad i tried it  but for the calories    id rather eat jenis ice cream in chagrin falls    final thoughts  not worth  the calories 
gorgeous hotel that may or may not have been the work of frank lloyd wright  its undisputed that frank lloyd wright came out to arizona to work on the biltmore  but how much did he contribute  the arizona biltmore wont tell  theyre coy about it  a bit high priced  its been thru several owners since the economic meltdown  but the new ownership group is supposed to be pumping money into it for a much needed refurbishment  a nice experience 
so  mexican food in pittsburgh  hellz yeah  yinzerita   the 412 burrito  412 burrito  well yes  a burrito with fries and slaw in the burrito  its pittsburgh  we ate upstairs on the patio  seems a bit out of place for the neighborhood  shadyshade seems pretty gentrified to me with its apple store and microsoft store  but then again  theres nothing fru fru about a yinzerita and a 412 burrito 
beautiful oasis reminiscent of an english garden  we saw the spring motif  giant bugs   butterflies as well as raindrops   wooden dutch shoes  lots of detail  with the theme following thru to the courtyard behind the recpetion desk   it apparent that a lot of attention is lavished on this place  it would be neat to see the seasonal changes
best breakfast and lunch in vegas    excellent food and service   the chef and owner does a great job in putting out a fantastic meal  he puts a lot of love into his restaurant   keep up the great work  i will definitely be back 
my wife and i love this place  she loves the catfish  greens   and chicken wings  i dont eat meat anymore so i go for the mac and cheese  the mac and cheese is legit  service is excellent too  great food  great service  and great mac and cheese     that mac and cheese is legit      highly recommended swinging by there for some good eats 
excellent thai food   i havent had good thai food in a long time and this places food is soooo good  i love spicy food  i usually order 4 5 stars but 3 stars at this place was hot   only thing i wish the owner would consider making changes is the presentation of the food when served   use better or higher quality serving plates or bowls to make good look more appealing   highly recommend this place 
excellent version of nyc pizza  the white cheese is excellent with chicken  would recommend this place if you like thin crush pizza and a pizza that doesnt make you stuffed after eating  staff was nice and friendly  would definitely go back   great place to grab late night pizza craving 
had a great experience here  staff was friendly and place was clean  food was good for a cafe  mto fried chicken steaks special was good  claim chowder was okay wont order chowder again   mto donuts was good but little pricey but its good when its nice   hot   i would commend this place if you are looking for a nice sit down cafe 
food was great but there was one rude waitress that ruined my visit here    my husband and i came to get food for ourselves   his niece  as we pick up our food the waitress that handed us our food commented that it was a lot of  food    how could we eat that much not even whens  hungry shell be able to eat that much    i would have put a name but she wasnt even wearing her name tag  
overall great experience  one of the best restaurants in durham 
this is my new favorite diner in pittsburgh  i had the ham breakfast and it was so tender it almost melted in my mouth  and if you sit at the bar you might get to chat with hosea   if youre lucky   
mastros absolutely kills it  insanely expensive for a regular guy like me  but worth every penny  celebrated our anniversary with my wife and she loved it too  she got a lemon drop and they use some dry ice concoction so it steams and bubbles for awhile which was really cool  the steaks  filet and ny  were both on point  the shrimp cocktail was unreal  so freakin big and fresh  the butter cake was the best dessert ive ever eaten in my life  see yall next year 
ive had an unfortunate event occur because of getting my oil change at this jiffy lube  i drive a subaru impreza and after getting my oil change here last week  i had to get my car towed to the dealership in savoy  let me explain    when i got home from running a few errands with my daughter  i noticed a really bad burning chemically smell  i had my husband check it out when he came home and he noticed that they had overfilled the oil on our car  he called his friend  who used to be a subaru mechanic at the dealership in california  and his friend said that its harmful to drive the car overfilled with oil plus we should have it towed to the dealership here because it is common for people who change the oil on subarus to sometimes accidentally drain the differential front oil instead  the taps of both are right next to each other  and overfill the oil for the engine thinking it will compensate  and when that happens  that can totally ruin the car if you drive it  especially on the freeway    so we had it towed to subaru and we called jiffy lube to let them know what was going on  the manager seemed pretty nice and apologetic and even went to the dealership to look at our car  it turns out that the differential fluid was not drained  thank goodness     but the oil was overfilled  so the dealership drained out the oil and redid the oil change and didnt charge us  but we did get a  95 tow bill  jiffy lube refunded back our money from our oil change but would not help us tote the tow bill   thus  even though the manager was nice  but still  due to their mistake  were stuck with a  95 tow bill or you can say one heck of an expensive oil change with a load of problems  my husband had to cancel his dental appointment the next morning and miss some of work because of getting our car towed  etc    so we will not be coming back to this jiffy lube again  we will be going to the dealership for our oil changes from now on  it costs just the same and they know what they are doing 
had dinner there last night  our second visit  but it had been a while  the frites were great  crispy  well done  plentiful  actually too many for just two people   were not beer drinkers  although they have an extensive beer selection  our cocktails were good  and our waitress was a doll   two things keep this a 3 star review  the price point is too high for what it is  my burger was  11 00  and while it was fine  it was a couple of dollars overpriced   the other  and much worse part is that we left stinking of a dive bar with an unvented hood   you know that smell  it sticks with you all night  in your hair and on your clothes   not at all what i had hoped for  and this needs to be remedied  because that will keep us from coming back
great drink list  must try the nola cola   we started at the bar  had great service from the bartender  very friendly and quick to refill our drinks   ordered the sweet potato fries as an appetizer  which were interesting  in a good way   they were served with a remoulade  spicy and tangy  yum   we ended up eating upstairs  and while we thought the interior was really nicely done  the outdoor patio style chairs  and umbrella   were unnecessary additions   our server  april  was very good and helped with some recommendations about the menu   we ended up getting a few dishes for the table and then sharing them  so we tried a little of everything   the shrimp nachos were the most interesting  with large triangles of homemade tortilla chips   the catfish po boy was fine with a good fillet  although po boys seem to always have way more bun than is necessary   im not a fan of crabcakes  but i was told that they were ok  too   well be back  especially to drink  perhaps for another meal 
i dont care that its not authentic italian   authenticity is less of an issue for me than whether or not i can get what i want  prepared the way i like it   tutto pasta on king is very accomodating  reasonably priced  and gets my order right every time   the portions are enormous and we always take home tons of food  while still leaving satisfied   i will subtract 2 stars  though  for the lack of an appropriately sized bar area to wait in and the lame o bread basket with cheap olive oil 
my favorite place to eat on state st  at least it was until they ripped up the street  ah  progress  youre a bitch   i love everything here  recently had the orange chicken something or other  and the split pea soup   heavenly   the service is very good  staff is friendly 
super glad dominos is in this area  staff is great and quick  sparked up a good convo when i had a pizza delivered  the guy loves how i met your mother  pizza was warm and tasty  pizza pizza who  dominos is awesome 
what is lower than 1 star  terrible  when i first walk in there was a lady and a man smoking outside the door  instantly smoke went into my face  i walk in quickly  no one was there  i said  hello   someone behind me said  hi     it was the lady smoking when i walked in  she was the waitress  behind her walking in was the cook  holy  what terrible service  food was okay  price is fine  ill go back if i dont have to walk through smoke 
great quick eat  large portions for cheap  wished they took debit  credit  cash only  not quite sure how fresh the jerk meat is  its usually in the window and ive never seen them come out of the kitchen  also they dont have a restroom  they send you to the library near by 
love the chandler libraries  they have an area for little kids  computers for kids to play on  themed pamphlets with suggested book titles for you to consider reading  storytime in english and spanish  passes to get into various places like the zoo or museums for free  etc etc etc 
they are less expensive than petsmart  at least the dog food i bought was  there is a program if you give your name and phone number  it keeps track of your purchases and for example the dog food i bought  the guy said i would get a free bag after buying 12    first time i went in here  they were already closed 5 min before the actual posted closing time   2nd time  there was only a girl and she was not very helpful  she didnt offer me the program i mentioned above  its free   nor did she offer me help with the giant bag of dog food  even though i was limping    this time  a young man was there   carried the giant bag for me  offered me the program  and carried the bag out to my car   wish i could give them more stars  but my first 2 times here were less than stellar   good job to the young man with the good customer service skills  the girl needs some reskilling or upskilling in that dept  maybe train her on the products  as well  like the first reviewer mentioned 
the chicken is good  this place has gone downhill since my first review  sadly  the same surly  unfriendly people still work here  the one friendly person that worked here on my first review has since left  the biscuits are now always too dark  which means overcooked and therefore dry  and when you say something  they say its within their approved color range  what the heck     then fix your friggin color chart  these are dry and sucky  tonight surly unfriendly girl didnt even ask us if we wanted any of our pieces spicy  like we usually get  i forgot and my hubby wasnt paying attn  she didnt even ask if we wanted regular  just assumed  we come here often enough that she should recognize us  horrible customer service  kfc is just down the road  maybe we will try them next time we have a hankerin for fried chicken 
the best in the country          after years of my own neglect and mediocre florida dentists i was lucky enough to find dr  reed and his all star staff    have been there 4 times this year and always prompt  wonderful  accurate service and results     as well as a truly enjoyable time         at a dentist office        unheard of but true         thanks again             you all rock     
terrible customer service  for those who have been to vegas before know that you can have an open container and drink on the strip    i have been to this bww before and brought my  fat tuesday  drink in many times in the past  i drive 5 hours from la  get a yard drink  and get bww  its my thing and has never been a problem in the past    today while the restaurant was empty i was told i could bring the remaining sips of my fat tuesday drink into the restaurant  all four of us were told we couldnt eat there  the hostess said this was a new policy as of two weeks ago  i called the manager and was told it was two to three months ago that they made this policy  fun fact    i was in vegas and ate at bww with an outside drink four weeks ago   what poor customer service  i wont be back  lost service to repeat customers  not to mention the empty restaurant you would think they would be begging for business 
the food is great  the service is terrible sometimes  half the time i go there  there are people that just stand around talking or they are just acting like they are working 
i really hope this place makes it because i love the concept   good food  alcohol served  casual atmosphere  no wait service   we came on a wednesday and got the 50  off bottle of wine  great deal   my girlfriend had a margarita pizza that was excellent while i had the chicken parm with fettuccine  honestly  my chicken was a pretty tough piece of meat   but everything else was good and im sure if i got it again itd be better 
first time here  everything was great  the staff was very helpful and the office was nice  clean and well organized 
horrible experience      i waited for 40 minutes and when i went to get my money back they said my order was next  they apologized advising they were really busy and that they have to take their time to cook everything fully  so i waited again and my crepe was not cooked fully  it was doughy and mushy  i would not recommend this place to anyone 
my favorite club in vegas  xs is an older club but still one of the best hot spots in vegas   the decor of the place is really nice it has a really cool modern    asainy theme to it  the best part is that on a hot summer day its gorgeous because the majority of the club is outside and you can see the stars and just enjoy the nice weather   pretty people  hot go go dancers  im a girl and when i saw these dancers  i was like dayuumm  mmm music was okay    a tad too much techno  electronica  dance etc   even tho thats the new hip thing   the only complaint might be that the dance floor is small and its hard to dance when theres an endless line of people filing past you trying to cut through from the entrance to the pool area  dear dude who touched my behind   not cool 
first day in vegas  obviously  i didnt want to eat that much before the party  so  my friends and i opted for something small and to share  it is not a great idea to eat something salty and fatty before fitting into out tight clothes  but we really wanted something cheap  us 6 shared a hotdog  onion rings  and regular fries  the total was about  20  the hotdogs that we got was the billionaire dogs  which cost  10 99  it is a grilled kobe beef frank  with foie gras torchon  port onion marmalade and truffle mayo  the hotdog was pretty good  the foie gras torchon aka liver  was kinda gross because i expected them to slice the liver thinly or even grind it into a pate style  instead  they just put two blocks of yellow color liver on top of the hot dog  the onion was really well marinated to the point it got sorta over powering  the truffle mayo looked gross to me  but my friends loved it  i only liked the kobe beef and the buns haha  the beer battered onion rings were pretty darn good  it wasnt oily as i thought and the onion rings were perfect bite size  the fries were crunchy and not overly salted  overall  its a good place to come by if you dont want to spend too much at pinks hotdog   price is around the same but probably  1 2 cheaper   the downsize of this is that its located in an alley by the high rollers  i can tell that people will definitely miss this place and just go straight to sprinkles cupcakes or yardhouse  i know i almost did   
there was a time i really enjoyed this place  those days are gone  the wait is too long for sub par  over priced bar food  i will say they do have good beer specials  kudos to that 
i feel like nothing screams charlotte as much as lupies cafe  having grown up here  i cannot remember a time without lupies  the food is always consistent   very reasonably priced  ill admit it is not blow your mind good  but its pretty darn tasty  the staff is always pleasant  if youre ever in the huntersville area  they have a sister location up there 
ill give them the 4 stars on the house made bread alone  when we arrived they told us the bread was making  so wed have to wait a moment  i cant say i was overjoyed to hear that  however  i was overjoyed when i tasted it  for my entree i ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich  we were there for lunch   it was splendid  the only thing i wouldve changed was maybe taking off the lettuce   tomato  i did love how nicely grilled the wrap was    that the vegetable did not cause it to be soggy  to top it all off the service was excellent 
a tad above mediocre but not that elegant   the rooms are definitely affordable and enough to make you feel like youre in an okay hotel   the rooms just need some upgrading    and take it easy on the air freshener sprays within the hallways   rooms need a fridge  even if it is stocked with drinks   better furniture  and an improvement on the small details like design  color and style   but  it works because the location is better than you would think   there is great access to the strip and all the great places nearby via the lv blvd frontage   theres also a passageway from the food court to get to other retail stores and it takes you to the aria property   very convenient   didnt have to get in my car or take the tram   theres pedestrian access to lv blvd to get you to nyny and mgm   theres also less obvious roads to get you into and out of the property without having to utilize lv blvd by car to avoid pedestrians crossing   on top of this   there will be a cool development known as the park  which will bring great open areas to chill   the plans somehow remind me of some corporate open areas with water features over in costa mesa and irvine   kinda cool to see something different in lv   the sports arena and theater will bring lots of people when it opens   it will definitely be a future cool spot   the staff was great during check in  and checking out was easy   rooms and views are just pretty average though   sadly  i was on the third floor and had a great view of all the rooftop equipment    the spa had options  nothing really over the top   its a good feature to take advantage of to enjoy and feel refreshed   the pub service was excellent   i also thought breakfast there was satisfying  didnt get to try the buffet    didnt feel like wasting a meal there     if you have things to see and places to go in vegas  this will fit your needs and be within your budget 
i have enjoyed every doughnut i have gotten here   they have a unique doughnut  the peanut butter and banana  that was scrumptious the dough is wholly better than dunkin donuts or krispy kreme   i dough not know of any better doughnut shop in fm 
food is always very good  but the service is terrible   we went today and we had the worst service ever out of any restaurant i have been to in over 10 years  they need to hire many more servers  because they all have too many tables and are not able to provide adequate service   i should not have to wait 20 minutes to receive the bill after i ask for it 
ok  so no doubt the food is high quality buffet food  not a lot buffets think about what theyre serving to people and usually offer the same foods  someone said to me once   you go to one chinese buffet  you been to them all   which was partially true  the wicked spoon offered some amazing foods  my favorites were the shrimp and grits  the pork shoulder  omg the pork shoulder   and the rock crab  they also have the best dessert bar ive ever experienced  but  what destroyed my experience was the customer service of the waitress  she ignored us for the first 45 mins  she walked pass us about 4 5 times  and even then  i had to call her over and tell her we never ordered our drinks  then she exclaimed that she didnt know we seated because our ticket we received at the counter wasnt sitting up right  which it was  ive received better services from places a third of the price  it feels like eating at a place where you are not welcomed  i did not leave a tip and will not be dining there again 
throwback to 60s las vegas  its in a dilapidated shopping center  and when you open the door the smell of old beer and smoke rushes past   but isnt this how you want to be greeted by a dive bar     the restaurant is separated from the bar to protect the diners  did i say diners   eaters     from the smokers in the bar   its down and dirty good food at a cheap price and take home proportions   and if youre there during an nfl game  pizza  stromboli  wings  etc  are half price thereby making the place twice as good   my office is just across the freeway and my business power lunches are at places familiar to most  but when i go to lunch with a friend  we go here   check your upscale image at the door 
questions  is bread best when it has the fragrance of yeast rather than cardboard   is new england clam chowder supposed to be cream colored rather than gray   are sushi rolls supposed to taste more like fish than cucumber  is sushi rice supposed to be flavored with rice wine vinegar  is  eel best when it tastes like eel rather than candy   is tuna supposed to be free of sinew threads that feel like thin dental floss   if your answer to any of the above is yes  then go somewhere else   grocery store deli sushi and canned chowder are better   seriously         and while im at it    what is it about las vegas bakers and bread   when you get bread here your response is usually  oh  it has that on it   or  it has this on it   or  i dont know what that is    i got a suggestion  buy  walmart frozen east rolls   follow the directions  and your patrons will roll their eyes so only the whites show and bury their faces in the bread basket   taste is better than how clever you are 
there is no one better then miguel and his team  i refer everyone to this crew  i have seen a lot of make up artists and hair stylists  they dont have what this group of people do  they are gracious  helpful  loving and above all talented  had my hair and make up done for an event myself and i was more then blown away  i will forever send all my clients to him and his team  far exceeds my expectations time and time again  i will never trust anyone else  i am super grateful to have met this man and his team  if you use them you will be beyond satisfied  you will feel the most beautiful you have ever felt in your life  book these awesome people you wont be sorry   the customer service goes above and beyond anything i have ever seen  i scheduled a time and they were 15 minutes early  i have called other places where i was just waiting around  they were waiting for me  it was simple to pay and all of their tools were clean  i am very picky about the cleanliness of tools seeing as how i am in the hair industry  the make up brushes were clean and polished ready for use  this experience is hard to find in vegas so if your looking for the experience of a life time and for everyone to come out right and on time i suggest you hire this team   the prices are above but the team is above average  if you want things done right and by the best you have to pay for what you want  you get what you pay for  dont be that model or bride crying on your special day  to the best experience i have ever had thank you guys you went above and beyond for me and i am so appreciative  will be using you again soon    happy holidays 
we went to fnb last year and decided to return this year too even though we like to try new places because it is just that good   the menu had changed and we had new items and fell in love with this place all over again   i cant believe what they do with vegetables   amazing   the wine is lovely too   recommend you order several appetizer and sides of vegetables and you can almost skip a main course because the other stuff is just spectacular 
2  for 4 40 minutes of self wash its a good place for a quick rinse but thats almost too short amount of time for anything else    my friend had a super muddy suv and the pressure washer on the self wash area did a great job  we had to use it for 2 rinses to get everything off    come by if you like a great quickie   
stopped through here for a late lunch and we will definitely be back  the servers are so nice and informative and the food is yummy  the place is modern and swag  if you like good food and pretty servers you will love it here 
husband and i had lunch here  the service was good and so was the food  great place to eat  
i decided to take my guy mark out since he works way too much and he needed a night out   the cajun queen did not disappoint   our waiter bob was very friendly   we started the evening with a bowl of seafood gumbo and a side of andouille sausage   the gumbo was delicious and the andouille was grilled to perfection   mark ordered the crawfish etouffee and i ordered the blackened shrimp n grits   both dishes were amazing and paired well with our legion beer   well done cajun queen  well done 
we have had a unit at this particular public storage location for about 6 months now  at the beginning of renting this unit  we specifically asked about pest control  we were told that the units are regularly sprayed for pests and they do not have an issue with pests   in the past few weeks  we have gone back to the unit multiple times  only to find a cockroach infestation that has been getting worse and worse   i called a few weeks ago and miraculously was able to get someone on the phone  they told me to put some traps in there which we did  the next few times  the problem has gotten excessively worse   yesterday we went to the unit and there were so many roaches in plain sight that we did not even walk into the unit  i called the office again  and someone answered the phone  when i alerted them of the infestation  they hung up on me  tried calling back 6 or 7 times that day and left a message and no answer and no one got back to me  today  same thing  impossible to get ahold of someone and terrible customer service   on top of all this  they raised our bill  which we paid  to double the price with no explanation  considering the units are all within inches of each other and not well sealed  even for a  climate controlled  unit   i would guess this infestation is much larger than just our unit  there is roach feces in every inch of eyesight  this is a huge health concern  we are extremely unhappy with this location and would not recommend to anyone  if i could give zero stars i would 
the service here was very impressive  carla took really good care of me and she was so much fun  these people love people and the place is very clean and inviting  the food was very yummy and fresh  i had some sushi leftover and carla set it all up for me to go on ice  i totally recommend this place  i will gladly be back 
i thoroughly enjoyed my experience here  you get to pick exactly what you are going to eat and they cook it right in front of you 
the bomb dot com  they shave their deli meats to order at jms so all the meat is fresh    ive been here thousands of times and the quality is always primo  the odd times where it wasnt as spectacular as usual  its always the breads fault  however   very rarely is the bread stale or been sitting out too long    i always get the italian  mikes way  it rocks    ive had the turkey and the philly steak before and theyre both good too    the one downside is the price  a giant can be  14   which is the most expensive of all the sandwich shops like subway  firehouse  port of subs  capriottis etc    i pay it willingly knowing im getting the best product  im also part of the rewards program which gets me a free giant every 144 points    best italian sandwich in the valley 
one of the worst staff with attitude and worst service  the slim guy in the specs is filled with ego and pride with an audacity to argue with customers  we ordered 2 goat dum biryanis to go  and this is what we heard on the phone    your order will be ready in 35 minutes sir   we reach the place after 40 minutes and the guy says itll take a few more minutes  we wait for another 10 minutes outside the restaurant  thats when i start getting angry  but finally after 50 minutes  the order is ready  the only thing i tell the guy with the specs is that if you say 35 minutes  please try and make sure that it is ready in 35 minutes  he first argues that we ordered at 1 40 pm  i asked him to see the time and it was 2 31 pm  he said sure and me and my friends go sit in the car about to start driving back home  the guy has the audacity to come out to the parking lot and start arguing that goat dum biryani takes a lot of time  and he had said  about 35 minutes  on the phone and not just 35 minutes  so basically he is trying to say that his  about  35 minutes has a buffer of      15 minutes  such ego is not good for business and im surprised that a staff member can have such audacity to talk to customers like that  they need to understand that even 3 michelin star restaurants have a cut off time of 30 minutes for an order  or at least theyll tell the correct amount of time required    first of all we have to have the greasy food that these people make  and on top of that we have to bear such humiliating behavior from the staff  all i can say is that they just lost good customers   i wouldnt even give 1 star but thats the minimum one can give 
gelato samples were delicious   cookies and cream was my favorite  definitely have to stop by if youre at the mall 
tim and his moving team were by far the best weve dealt with  we recently moved from scottsdale to peoria and tim gave us a competitive quote  he charges per item rather than the typical hourly rates    his team was quick and effective  also did not scuff up any walls whatsoever  very genuine guys and will definitely be using them for our next move 
ive been here several times  always get either the vegetable curry or the chicken curry pie  both are amazing with just the right amount of spice that i enjoy  i sometimes get the kebab roll as well  service is always friendly  would definitely recommend this place to anyone who asks  there are some more items on their menu that i should try  good amount of variety of items  there really arent any cons to list 
great park for little ones  the playground area is completely fenced with one way in and out  i love the fact that the ground is covered in green faux grass with soft padding   they have a bigger and smaller kids play structures  very clean and beautiful 
had a very nice lunch experience at jump  i enjoyed the modern yet intimate decor of jump and found the service to be professional and helpful   i had the juice of the day and it was very nice and refreshing  then started with the mushroom soup  loved the fact that there was no cream in the soup  made it much healthier    i hope   then had the bay scallops parpadelle  the pasta was toothsome and i know for some ppl they might not like how naked the pasta is  i e  little sauce but i absolutely loved that  i dont like pasta that swims in a puddle of suace   i hope to return to try the dinner service
toms urban is great and maggie is just awesome  ive eaten here 3 times over the past few days and she has offered consistently solid recommendations from the menu  the lobster and shrimp tacos are delicious  as is the prime rib philly  but what i am going to miss the most is the pineapple upside down cake  omg i hate we dont have one of these in atlanta 
great place in the miracle mile shops   straight forward menu pricing  portions appropriate for lunch  we enjoyed salads and pasta dishes  not gourmet dining but for  5 exceeded expectations   and the drinks three for  10   approximately the size of those at casino  but you can mix and match your three  cocktail before your meal  wine with it and sweet something for dessert   the drinks did not seem watered down or heavy on mixer either  servers were prompt and professional   other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves as well  we will be back on our next las vegas adventure  probably more than onxe
taylor was very friendly and professional  she did an awesome job  i originally bought a groupon for 2 hours and decided to start biweekly service  it was amazing to come home to a clean home    great service   
we had two pictures framed and the quality of the final product is really bad  in both  one of the corners has indentations  no idea what caused it  and in one the frame is not assembled flush  we had a 30  discount and that was probably due to the low quality 
my boyfriend and i have been regulars here for almost a year now  they always deliver excellent service and food  the chicken parmigiana is our favorite  and i love their house salad with the mediterranean vinaigrette  also  the bread is hot and crunchy on the outside  but soft on the inside  yum  i always ask for balsamic vinaigrette but my boyfriend prefers just olive oil and fresh pepper  and  theyre constantly sending out email coupons  for  10  20 off  and half priced wine 
im so glad i chose this place for my boyfriends birthday dinner  as they did not disappoint at any moment  our server was one of the best servers ive ever had  im pretty sure his name was brandon but my boyfriend thought it was brendan  he was super knowledgeable on the menu  as well as personable and friendly  anyways  we spilt a caesar and a filet mignon  and my boy got the king crab  we were amazed with every dish  the king crab has caviar  and the caesar had prosciutto  there were so many amazing flavors and everything came out extremely quick  considering how busy it was  they gave my boy a box of chocolates for his birthday and a  25 gift card  but most importantly stellar service and food  we will definitely be back 
we had visited another restaurant owned by the same group previously  and loved it  so we had high hopes for this place to  most of the food was pretty tasty and service was attentive  we started with cocktails and crispy pork ears served with quick pickles  the ears were nice and crunchy   more like crispy bacon than some other places ive tried them  we also had the poutine which much like american poutine in general does hold up to its canadian counterpart  but if you havent had it in canada  this one was okay  my one compliant is the cheese curds   there isnt enough and their consistency is such that they dont really melt  i had the buffalo two ways   buffalo steak served with buffalo sweet breads  the steak was yummy and fairly light  i usually like sweet breads  but these were maybe too big because they seemed a little too glandular for me to stomach  plus i wasnt a fan of the buffalo sauce  if you like buffalo wings  you might enjoy this spin  we also had the bone in steak served with twice baked potatoes  it was a nice steak and a good representation for a restaurant of the same name 
last night we stopped in with friends and had a great time at the dual piano bar in harrahs  a set of female twins performed  wound up the crowd  and sang some great participative tunes fit for crazy drinking out of towners   it was great to settle into an atmosphere that was comfortable for folks over 40 versus a bar full ov millennials   these ladies were hilarious  they egged on college rivalries and seemed to know the college fight songs   we requested piano man  always popular choice  they did a splendid job of working the crowd  it was loud and fun  although they performed tunes on request  they also embarrassed folks celebrating anniversaries and birthdays   they always got the crowd to sing along loudly  the place was packed by the time we left  way to go ladies 
visited over easy based on feature on ddd  went on a weekend during spring training  place was crazy busy  had tons of help  but the kitchen was not able to keep up with the crowd  we waited for about 40 minutes for our food  servings were generous  food was great 
food was decent but on the expensive side  the games on sports tv channels was comprehensive 
i had a terrible experience here  the puppies were adorable  and we played with several of them and i chose one  i had not intended on purchasing a puppy that day but i thought  what the heck  we always wanted one  the prices were really high  and we came back the next day to return and they still said i have to pay 40  for a dog i no longer had  they over load you with paperwork and crap and you do not get to process everything  especially with an adorable puppy in your arms  not only that  but our dog was really sick in the afternoon the next day  why would they sell me a sick dog for 3000   overall a terrible experience  i would not recommend anyone going there  purchase straight from a breeder for the rarer breeds to avoid the third party costs   and not just that  everything is expensive including the  free  starter kit they used   awful
i placed an order for 6 people this morning to be delivered  i received a phone call shortly after placing my order just double checking our order  she was very sweet and polite  we received our food not too long after receiving the phone call  the food was so yummy and i definitely recommend their breakfast 
one of my favorite places for breakfast  go for the chorizo con huevos or huevos rancheros  noms  
as my son has become obsessed with fps games as of late we wanted to surprise him for his birthday and battlefield did not disappoint  the have a package that is chambered for a  22lr that is tailored for younger kids  each person has their own instructor who ensures safety and makes sure everything goes smoothly  he was able to shoot    sig mosquitoe    walther p 22   mpi 69   m 16    he had an absolute blast  i chose the mp 5 which was a blast as well  they have an exhaustive list of firearms and packages you can chose from up to a mini gun that shoots 5000 rounds a minute  we did not have a long wait  its right off the strip  everybody was friendly  and i cannot recommend this enough 
in 30 years for having sprinkler work   both install and repair  in both arizona and california i have never experienced a more professional company   highly professional  finished on time and the company is a joy to work with   if you use anyone else  well the best of luck   this company sets the gold standard in the phoenix metro area 
we went here for mothers day  i was a bit hesitant just by looking at the outside but went ahead  we ordered the fried pickles with ranch  they were great and the ranch was awesome  seems like they make it themselves  we also have the shrimp cocktail and the special  which was a club sandwich with steak fries  the shrimp were excellent and tasted fresh  the club was great  fries were great  and the server was wonderful  i believe his name was josh       cocktails were on point as well  i had an infused vodka with berries and cucumbers  well definitely be back 
just spent  15 on drinks then asked for a water as well     was told each glass of water was  1      really      can you say absurd rip off 
this is a great place to eat if you are looking for something cheap  delicious  fast and filling  the small lunch combo is rice with 2 choice of meat for  6 50 and a large for  7 50  they accept cash only and there arent many seats for dine in  i have tried their bbq pork  roast pork  roast duck  soy chicken and sausage in the rice combo  my favourite by far is the roast pork because its always so juicy and the skin is very crispy  i come here at least once a week for lunch before work and the quality of the meats are always consistently good  staff working there are always friendly and quite fast with getting the orders done  i definitely recommend trying this bbq place out 
best lobster place ive ever been to  incredible warm lobster croissant roll  the mac n cheese was also wonderful    the owners of the place were super friendly and the inside wasnt too busy 
nice people who work there  cute little place  crepe was delicious and there was plenty of it  would go back again and i definitely recommend it  it wasnt terribly expensive  around  6 for a crepe 
went here with a friend on a friday after finding lolita  intended place to go for the night  had a wait for an hour and 45 minutes  i should have made reservations but i didnt think it would be that long for just two people  anyways  i was open to try other places    so we crossed the street and checked out this place instead  what a great replacement  i ordered the mussels and clams  side of squash  and a martini  the mussels and clams were cooked right and tasted great  the squash was grilled and seasoned right  it was very flavorful  the martini tasted strong but isnt that what a martini should be   im not complaining at all  i forgot what the name of the drink is called but it had grapefruit in it so it was pink  the waitress said its their most popular drink  my friend ordered their pizza    it was flatbread pizza with chicken and it was good too  the presentation was elegant and it is one of those places you take a person on a date for  a candlelight dinner but they do have a bar area with tvs so it can be a chill place to go too  the decor is very elegant and the bar area is wooded so you have that nice crisp look 
went here with a group of friends on a saturday night  it was packed but we were able to still get some lanes for the 6 of us  you cant really expect much from a place who hasnt remodeled since the 80s  your typical bowling alley  they got like 60 lanes and heard they do tournaments here too  they do have a bar  lounge inside and drinks are dirt cheap  coronas for  3 50  special bomb shots i think were  3 a piece  a couple of tvs in the lounge but nothing to rave much about    this place also got a pool hall in the back  an arcade  and your typical carny food  nachos  mediocre hot dogs  overpriced beverages and chips  etc   shoe rentals  3  we were luckily playing unlimited from a friend that frequents there so cant really complain  overall fun night with some great peeps 
cute place they have in the tremont local area  all of their chocolates are hand made and they have wine and beer tastings on some nights  fairly new business and next time youre in the neighborhood  make sure you stop by  theyre open till 8pm on weekdays  in addition to their chocolates  they also have a wine selection ranging from their dessert to your regular type for red and white  what girl doesnt like small delicate candies   i got a box of 6 and if i recall they were  1 95 each so nothing too pricey  if youre a toffee lover  you have to try their schweetie pie one  it tastes like a heath bar and very rich 
heard of its famous name but have never had a chance to try it  here i am at tsujiri  i ordered the sundae matcha  the ice cream  is sooooooooo good       it has a pink sakura flowery shaped cookie  a mochi and a chestnut on top of the ice cream   the ice cream has a rich flavour of matcha and it is not too sweet  as i finished the top layer  theres red bean in the middle layer in the mdist of the matcha  ice cream   yum  yum  at the bottom  it has roasted rice from rice crispy  the roadted flavour blends perfectly with the icecream flavour  i will definitely come back again for other sweets 
i ordered a chirashi with rice  it has a variety of different kinds of fish and they are fresh and good  besides the fish  theres plenty of rice on the side and the rice is well seasoned 
quick lunch late saturday afternoon  ordered an infamous macau pork chop sandwich with hong kong style lemon tea  pork chops sandwich is pretty good  other than pork chop  it also has some herbs and onions inside the sandwich  at first glance  i was thinking i might need to add some ketchup or other seasoning to enrich the taste  after my first bite  it assures me i can not judge by its plain appearance  it does taste good and no extra seasoning is needed  the hong kong style lemon tea   however  tastes a little bit dull  i mean it is kind of plain and does not have tea and lemon flavour in the drink    my husband did also order a baked dish  chicken with rice in a spicy sauce  it also had cheese on top of the sauce  although the dish is not very big  it is pretty filling  the sauce is slightly salty to my taste but its good enough to fill a hungry stomach    this restaurant has a fancy menu which looks like a newspaper with pictures and descriptions  it is attractive and entertaining to read  i will come back to try other dishes next time 
feel so good to have a full breakfast before the start of a day  theres an early bird special for a good breakfast at  5 99  which includes 3 eggs  a choice of ham or sausages  fruits  4 slices of toasts  and a choice of home fries or french fries  the breakfast is so big that i could share it with my husband and both of us are full at the end   the breakfast comes with a slice or orange and a slice of cantaloupe  they are sweet like honey  the eggs are perfectly done to my request  sunny side up  i always request for french fries which i like them more than home fries  french fries are crispy and taste better to my preference  theres always refill for coffee   the service is good  the waitress remembers what we like and what we want to order  the good service makes me feel like home 
i am impressed by their service before i order anything  i came with a group of friends after badminton and there were 12 of us  the waiter worked so hard to find all the vacant tables and chairs and put them together for us  hes so sincere and did everything with a smile   this place is not too big but its nicely decorated and packed with many customers  its fond of its shaved ice and i ordered a matcha  shaved ice   there are red bean  almond slices  mochi  match ice cream  and matcha powder on top of the shaved ice  basically  the taste of all of these ingredients blended very well together  personally  i find that its a bit too sweet    even though the shaved ice tastes a bit too sweet  i love their service and this is what attracts me to come back again  i will certainly come back to try another flavour of shaved ice 
i love the banfield pet hospital here  they always take car of my pup and are always very helpful and accommodating  i used to drive to my local one and they never seemed to care or be helpful so now i drive 45 mins away one way and its the best decision ive made so far  love the staff here very friendly 
das frank is the man  i initially spoke to joey on the phone he took care of me and put me with das  i finally drove from arizona to nevada putting complete trust on this tattoo  das drew it up showed it to me we made very very minor changes    fast forward 20 minutes later      the template was on my leg and he went to work  took a few hours we took a 5 then came back i didnt want to see it until it was done  so he finished i got up and holy shit it was a super bad ass tattoo  didnt really hurt and das made me feel like ive known him for awhile    in closing das is the man with the plan  go see him if youre in the area  definitely coming back to see him to do more work for me  thanks dude 
i love this field  we try going as much as possible  has a retractable roof top and its ac controlled  lots of vendors  decent food  alcohol kinda pricey but not too bad  overall i love the place 
awesome little cafe  the married couple who owns  serve this place are both nice  love the chicken kabob and lamb gyro  definitely worth trying
the most amazing food    oh the smashing pumpkin  to die for    on the specials list  there are so many choices  the special are always good    you got to try an appetizer for starters  crab cakes are great  steak  seafood  pasta  burgers    im so glad amels exists  spoiled rotten 
great restaurant if you are in the mood for fresh and healthy style mexican food and do not want to pay extra money to be waited on hand and foot   i am from california  and the closest thing i can compare it to would be baja fresh  but blue burrito has a full service bar which is a really nice addition   the only negative thing i noticed was the mini taco soft shells   they are about the diameter of an orange which is a little strange   they do provide an unlimited supply of chips and salsa so that helps   the burritos are large   everything seems very fresh and they dont use lard of other unhealthy additives   they need to open one of these in l a    i would go there all the time 
this was the first real castle ive ever seen in real life and id have to say it was worth the wait   edinburgh castle is how i imagined a castle would look like as it sits high on a hill overlooking the town   the things that really amazed me about the castle were the following      its built on a extinct volcano  castle rock   and you can tell by looking at the black rocks below the castle   see my photos     we drove into town from glasgow and the castle is hard to miss at the top of the hill   i couldnt keep my eyes off it        the view of the city once you are at the top of the castle near the cannons is pretty amazing too        it has some pretty impressive cannons like the mons meg and the one oclock gun   it was last fired on october 14  1681   long ago it was taken to the tower of london  a casualty of the disarming act  but returned to edinburgh castle 70 years later instead of being melted down   see my photo     the half moon battery that served as the defense of the east front   the battery was the first home of the one oclock gun     i would highly recommend visiting edinburgh castle 
i would not recommend this pub to anyone  after my boyfriend and i had spent money on a couple of drinks in here  we decided to order a sunday roast   unfortunately the bar staff decided my boyfriend had had enough despite the fact he was absolutely fine and could not give him a valid reason for this assumption  they also insinuated i was a working girl and that i was drunk as well  despite the fact i had only had half a cider  when i asked to speak to the duty manager  he hid behind the bar and did not come out from behind it to talk to us civily nor provide us with a reasonable explanation  i thoroughly regret spending money in here and would advise anyone with any sense not to give this bar any business  the staff are generally unhelpful  unreasonable and the duty manager has no idea how to deal with complaints 
believe it or not  i have lived in mississauga for 20 years and it was my first time visiting jack darling memorial park last weekend   the weather was beautiful on saturday  but it was scorching hot in the afternoon so we waited until dinnertime for a photography walk at the park    as soon as i was about 50 metres from the water  i was in awe of the view  not only was the view of lake ontario amazing  we even saw the skyline of downtown toronto  the waterfront trail was nicely paved from one end to another  there were many people at the park that night  but its a fair size so everybody was pretty spread out    on the downside  there are a lot of canadian geese and seagulls at the park  which only means one thing   a lot of bird poop   mostly by the grass close to the water though   there were also a lot of flies and mosquitoes  and we did not come prepared for that 
this place is fairly decent  burgers are delicious  what attracted me was the price for their 4 oz burger which is only  3 49 so i thought id give it a try   i order the texas burger  4 oz  for  3 49  if you want to add cheese  its an extra dollar  the patty is thin  looks so much like the real mccoy patty  overall i think this place is comparable to the real mccoy in scarborough   my bf got the 7oz homemade burger  again  taste is pretty solid  he got a combo with fries and a small pop  fries are just ok   so the bill came up to  12 45  pretty cheap huh   you get what you pay for  i would probably come back in the area if i am craving for a cheap burger 
took my mother here for her birthday dinner as it is pretty hard to find a steakhouse that has prime rib thats not too far off the strip  my new york steak came out medium well and extremely charred when i had ordered medium  server immediately apologized and offered to get me a new one  my mother got the new orleans prime rib which she absolutely loved  our server was awesome 
kathy and joe are absolutely amazing they have been doing my nails for years and i have no complaint they take the extra mile to make sure you look good feel good  
great new place with a lot of space  ordered some apps   goat cheese bruschetta and sweet potato fries  both were awesome  beer was good too  good prices and portions  would definitely return 
this may not be a super posh place with loud trendy music but the folks here do a fabulous job  ive come several times and been extremely happy with my mani  pedi  gel mani  and even eyebrow waxing  each of the women ive had were so nice and give great hand massages after your manicure  angela is one of my favorite ladies to go to but you shouldnt be disappointed with any of the team  essie gel color number 8 is my go to nude pink color and it always look fabulous  my mani here has lasted longer than any other gel manicure ive gotten   ive gone almost 3 weeks without a crack or dulling of color  they offer refreshments including wine if you want which always makes it more relaxing   
the owner was nice and chef curtis was friendly  he served a great breakfast  i was hoping to hear more about the coffee selections from the owner  but instead she just directed me to the house roast  which was not good  i would have paid more money for a better selection  but  she seemed too busy with the other four patrons to discuss them with me    the negative  chef curtis wife was not sociable and should not be working directly with customers at the register  when i went to pay my bill  she never greeted me  gave me eye contact  nor thanked me for coming  she just took my money and walked away  she never opened her mouth  this was my first visit  not a good impression  but  again  the food may bring me back to the restaurant for a second visit  if the customer service was better  i would have rated 5 stars    tip  chef get a second phone for your business so you wont have to answer the phone with  hello   i thought i had the wrong number when calling the restaurant    
the circus circus manor motor lodge is a good place for families and those just needing a place to crash in las vegas  we reserved the room during the circus circus half price sale and the rooms were all of  30  the bed was comfy  the wi fi worked well and the room was clean and tidy  they are renovating the rooms and that is nice  the major drawback the keeps this from earning a 4  very good  rating  there are no coffee pots in the rooms    the motor lodge is behind the main building and quite a ways to the strip  wear your walking shoes 
expensive  it is a beautiful hotel   nice staff and nice pool area   however   if you are going with a family  it can get very expensive 
very bad service   what is wrong with these people   i go here for the third time  the first two with poor service also  but it is local and i want to be fair  and the people there are surly and unhelpful   i will not be back   there are other local businesses where my money is welcome 
just this moment got back from dinner at the carriage inn in elizabeth  pa  i stopped long enough to make myself a sandwich of one slice yellow cheese on two slices plain white bread and that alone was miles ahead of what i was served at carriage inn for a meal  before i wrote this review  completely inedible   ordered fish on a dish with onion rings and cole slaw   the fish was cold  greasy  and limp  same for the rings  the slaw was dry and sour  my nephews fish was the same   my friends medium well steak arrived rare  was sent back and returned well done   exceedingly frustrating  and as the manager wasnt on duty there was nothing anyone could do about adjusting the bill for all the uneaten  and i mean uneaten  food   i wont be back   they wont miss me  theres a sucker born every minute  
i rent here weekly and have for about the last 3 months  i have done business with a lot of different rental companies and nothing beats hertz  actually nothing beats this location hertz  samantha is so awesome  she knows me by name and is always extremely excited to talk to me which makes me feel like family  she is always looking for ways to save me money and always keeps a fresh line up of cars vans and trucks  i even got in an accident once and she was so great about it  completely took the stress out of the situation  thanks samantha  you are so great to us
went here for lunch  nice trendy place  i ordered the lunch combo with calamari salad and bisque  it also came with a side of fries  portions were on the small side  calamari looked a little on the over cooked side but salad tasted great otherwise  my uncle got the carnitas tacos and he said he enjoyed it 
this is my perfect example of a corner pub   the inside is cozy an neat   the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable  the food is excellent pub food with a mix of items you wouldnt normally find in a pub for those who are not fans of pub grub   they have a  pie of the day  which was a chicken  leek and mustard pie when we first ate there and it was delicious   they have an excellent malt whiskey selection and quite a few macallans i had not seen before which was fantastic for me   the atmosphere feels like you are walking into a well used sitting room   comfy chairs and booths provide most of the seating 
i am giving them three stars as an average of all the categories on which i rate a pub  atmosphere  service  drinks and food   on the atmosphere side they have it down pat for a great little old world pub   it feels close and cozy around the bar in the front   in the back there is a dining area that can seat larger groups   they need to do a better job of making that known as the first time we tried to go there we walked in with a group of 9 and saw how little room there was in the front room and left   service is where this place really took a hit for me   they do not have servers to come to your table   you have to go to the bar and place all your orders   this is fine for a small group or if you are just having drinks   however  with a group of 9  which honestly on holiday isnt that odd a number  it was quite difficult to get food ordered   they were also out of many dishes   drinks we average in my opinion   they had a decent selection of beers and wines  but very little in the way of scotch which i think is odd in a scottish pub   food was very good once we got it  the steak and ale pie was delicious    all in all this pub is great for a small party or for just drinks   but for larger parties and good table side service this is not the place 
it is not all that great as they make it seem  they are feeding off the numerous students who cannot get into unlv or cns nursing programs  their tuition is 90k for their 2 1  2 year bachelors program  their staff make it seem like is all worth during your first visit  but this is what they dont tell you    discouraging staff   there is one student advisor for 500  students    lack of supplies  resources  there is one small printer for 500  students    credits not transferable  once you begin you have to finish the program because their credits arent valid anywhere in nevada    inconvenient class registration   they have one day in which all students have go their campus to sign up for classes  that is for every session  not just for new students     insufficient course availability  most courses only have one class  30 students  for each subject and are only available during one time slot    if that is not enough advisors and professors do not provide any kind of help or support to understand the subject or to help you reach your nursing core start date given to you in your first pcw   my honest opinion as a student is steer clear of this institution  they are not in any way willing to help you reach your goal of becoming a nurse 
favorite pittsburgh pizza shop around  doesnt quite compare to my dear pizza my heart   home  but definitely havent found anything better in the area  staff is very friendly  pizza is greasy but good 
i moved to murrysville for a year long project assignment at work  and i was delighted to find walkers pet hotail right down the street from my apartment  my dog lila is by no means high energy  but i dont have a yard and wanted a place for her to play with other dogs on occasion  so i bought a daycare package from walkers  they were very generous and allowed me to drop her off 15 minutes before they opened due to my work schedule  and they were always very sweet with lila  they are also very thorough about vet records  which i appreciated   they require vaccination records directly from your vet  and follow up when their paperwork indicates that your dogs vaccines need to be renewed  this reduces the risk of canine flu  kennel cough  etc  spreading throughout the kennel   their grooming is also very affordable compared to other prices i found in the area   i bought the daycare package because the number of weeks matched perfectly with my assignment in pittsburgh  but when my dog needed surgery on her leg and would have to be essentially immobile for 8  weeks  they were very kind and refunded me the remainder of the package i purchased  i cannot recommend walkers highly enough 
this place is owned by the nicest couple  and their work is spot on  of course  its not the cheapest tailor in vegas  but being experts of their craft in summerlin  you get what you pay for  ive never had a bad experience here  theres nothing that they cant do 
wife and i had a groupon for this place so decided why not     once inside all we really wanted to do was order to go  there were slices of pizza in a window that you could order but we wanted to order a whole pizza to go  when we asked they told us we needed to be seated in order to order a whole pizza   i was like seriously    so we sat down even though we did not want to and ordered a half and half pizza  one side margarheta and one side hawaiian  it was thin and cooked well  the taste was good  i prefer a crispier bottom crust than the one they gave us   overall  the pizza was good but the service was odd   
decided to go here for lunch with the kids  we ordered the dinner box  pork tonkotsu  as well as a salmon skin roll  eel avocado roll  and spider roll  the service was kind of slow and the first things to come out were the rolls  they were decently made well  rice to content ratio  however the sushi rice that was used was pretty mushy  usually a bad sign   the dinner box was sadly the most disappointing   the pork was really over cooked and very dry  the tempura shrimp and veggies was alright and the gyoza was soggy  not sure but they left it swimming in sauce instead of keeping it separate and crunchy   given the price and the quality of the food i sadly will not likely return  theres definitely better options out there as well in the sushi  teppanyaki genre 
i always love a good boba milk tea place and fat straw was definitely not the same cookie cutter place  it has definitely gotten a trendier look and design  sadly while the service was fast  the boba milk tea left a lot to be desired  it was neither sweet enough  pretty tasteless   and the panda boba as they called it was undercooked  i think they also give you just enough to generally cover the bottom of their insanely wide cups  which didnt fit my cars cup holder argh     overall  the price was rather high for the milk tea i got and it was not very tasty at all  im going to have to continue my search for the perfect milk tea boba joint 
had to come by again to try out some crunchy tacos  was praying that they made them like riendas but sadly it was not to be  the shredded beef was really good however quantity was lacking  the crunchy tacos themselves seemed overdone causing it to be a bit too crunchy almost bordering on burnt  their green sauce had a good amount of kick to it as well which saved the taco  lastly their price was a bit high at 2 25 each  would try this place again but go on taco tuesday as it becomes a  1 each    if youre looking for pretty decent crunchy tacos then try out this place  if youre looking for a replacement to riendas  keep searching 
indoor skydiving at this facility was one of the funnest things ive ever experienced  the staff makes you feel so comfortable and make you enjoy your experience even more  if youre able to choose your instructor  i suggest requesting justin  he was so hilarious and fun  and made my boyfriend and is experience so memorable  although all of the instructors seemed fun from watching other peoples experiences  i would def recommend this place to any and everyone  
really good for fast serve food  salads were fresh and thin crust pizza really crispy  and  the service was great   very patient and helpful as we took a while to decide 
nice atmosphere but the food didnt quite measure up   great live music and wednesday wine specials were good   rock shrimp was tasty but cold   flatbread was tough and toppings a bit bland   chocolate brownie good but apple crisp fell flat   will try another eatery next time in the area 
eh  its ok   nothing spectacular about their sandwiches   its a chicken breast with 2 pickle slices on a bun   nothing else   a simple meal of a sandwich  fries and a drink is nearly  7  if you want lettuce on your sandwich  its a charge of about  50  for a strip of lettuce     ill save my money and get a sandwich elsewhere 
awesome  this place makes the dream of hitting up shake shack and in n out in the same day a reality  and you can get canes the same day too  way to go  vegas  youre the best 
poor service  employees on cell phones while on front line  frozen bleu cheese dressing  old pizza  reached out on cicis website  assured me to try again with a coupon and never received 
great place    we just moved the area and we will make this a  go to  breakfast stop for sure  big place  diner setting  family owned  huge huge huge breakfast skillets  omelets and many kinds of pancakes and waffles from which to choose   our waitress was the best 
you wont catch me saying something bad about the hard rock cafe  this is a business i make sure to go to every time i can find one 
as a company theyre good im almost tempted to leave a one star however because i was nearly run off the road by one of their drivers   this company really needs to look at who they hire for drivers as one of them had one headlight out and was driving down a perfectly fine lit road with high beams on in traffic   in addition to nearly blinding me they also cut me off after i had moved out of their way so that i didnt have to be blinded by the high beams
i had fried rice  i didnt have any expectation  but it was so tasty  it was just like real japanese fried rice 
i had an amazing experience yesterday  rolly  an amazing sales lady  helped me with my horrible procrastination  i had purchased clothes over a year ago and i put some weight on and needed to exchange my pants and have them tailored  the wedding i am attending is this thursday  the tailor  tan  accomidated me right away and hemmed the pant legs while i waited  rolly and tan both went above and beyond to help me with exchanging my pants and taking care of a customer  even though i live in mesa  i will be back to this store 
im always excited when my guy suggests a new place for us to go thats completely off my radar  he suggested hals today for us while we were running north hills errands   i was game especially after reading yelp reviews raving about their great beer and bar food selections   our bartender gave us a warm greeting   we discovered stone was their only ipa on tap  only a few taps here  so the great beer selection clearly comes mainly in bottles  the bar is nicely appointed   also a bit dark   black ceilings   walls   i needed the light on my phone to read the menu in the afternoon    menu is bar food basic   not super extensive  i ordered the pulled pork with onion rings   hubby got a build your own burger  which excited him    onion rings  and these sandwiches were really good  the burger was gigantic   i heard happy noises next to me  my pulled pork was delicious with a perfect amount of barbecue sauce  my ciabatta roll was good but a bit too much bread  so after eating 1  4 of it as a sandwich  i forked the remainder  onion rings were good  not amazing    service impressed when we said wed split 1 last beer   our bartender drew 2 glasses she filled 3  4 full  pleasant surprise on the bill that the stone ipas were  5 when its pretty pricey by the case to buy    overall this is a nice bar to grab some bar food   a beer 
ordered 2 chicken wsap minus the pita wrap  so we requested everything in a bowl  the indian guy with the glasses is rude and ignorant while taking the order  took 20 mins to make two of these bowls  we asked for spicy  it was not spicy  the chicken was undercooked  by the way it was 10 30pm so place was empty  the guy gave us just the chicken with a slice of cheese on it  when we asked about the salad its suppose to come with   he said not anymore since they  changed the concept now   my friend ordered same exact thing 2 days ago  so we had to ask for salad which was just lettuce and one slice of tomato  i paid  22 for an empty bowl with just just few pieces of chicken with cheese slice on top   only came to the place becoz it is walking distance  never again  save your money and go to the pizza place next door  or anything else but this  overall   horrible service  good was uncooked  and this indian guy is stingy to give you a slice of tomato  dont know about other locations but this place was awful and waste of my money  never again 
my family went here on a trip up to flagstaff and are now ruined on barbeque  the prices were very reasonable  the portions big  the flavors fantastic  and the draft beers thirst quenching  i dont think ill ever have ribs that good again  our server and the bartender were very attentive  if you must go here  be sure to mention yelp for 10  off your order  we had the whole hog heaven   38  and q rolls   9   which were more than enough for four people  the amber ale  available in 21 oz glasses  is a good pairing  the ambiance is noticeably better than chillis  but not pretentious  stopping here was a highlight of our trip 
went here for dinner on a friday at 6 with gf  i made a reservation  although it had plenty of space  i was advised that it can easily fill up   ambiance of the restaurant was cool and staff was super nice and gave great recommendations  sonya     the reason i will be a repeat costumer was the food  my gf and i have both traveled to italy and we both agree that this was the best gnocchi we have ever had  they are huge  fluffy pillows that melt in your mouth  the meatballs and sauce in the dish were also incredible  i know the menu may change  but if this is on the menu get it   for dessert we split a brownie with nutella frosting  it was more like fudge  if you like dense brownies  like myself  this is also a great choice  and can easily be split 
this place is pretty great  it just opened up and serves nothing but chicken  between myself and my coworkers we must have tried almost everything  my butter chicken fingers were super tasty  my mac and cheese side was a bit boring in comparison   they have a million sides so ill have to try something else next time   they look to be frying everything up fresh to order  the fried chicken wasnt too oily or salty  impressive  i think this place is well worth checking out  my coworkers quarter chicken was cooked really well  he was very impressed  this place is definitely worth checking out 
my friends and i arrived at union a few days after it opened  the place was empty  nice  we would get a table  or so we thought  talking to the host  who was quite friendly  he explained they were totally booked for the night  and for much of the week  this place just opened  what  we decided to come back in two weeks   and so last night we went back  the same host seated us  explained the kitchen was still trying to sort out some kinks  took our drink orders  and left us to enjoy the ambiance of the place  union is a nice looking restaurant  it feels like a really nice bistro  its been under construction for something like a million years  for whatever reasons i dont quite know  its also one of the most hyped up places ever  apparently    the wine list is short  and the prices are quite reasonable  there are a few beers on tap  the dinner menu is also fairly short  and features a selection of dishes made with locally sourced ingredients  when we were there elk was featured  as was pork belly  rhubarb was in both mains  i imagine this will change from week to week if not day to day  everything on the menu sounded pretty good  prices werent astronomical  also a plus   im glad to say the reputation its earned in such a short time is well deserved  the food was great  the service was particularly good  the place was packed by the time we left  always a good sign   the restaurant is new  and its clear there are some kinks they need to work out  getting the food out to the tables seemed a bit slow  other than that  i have no real complaints   i also dont really mind waiting a bit for good food     this place is well worth checking out 
love this place  always manage to find something new and interesting when trip down from sedona area  we always end up spending more than we mean to just because we find way more than we expect to  specially their beer and wine selection  we ended up stocking up on sake just because of the amazing selection and prices  same goes for beers  they have a lot of the hard to find asian beers by the case  not just the 6 pack  we always cruise their seafood counter since it can be hit or miss  but more often than not we find more than we expect  if youre looking for a fun shopping experience go and check this place out  my mother whom was adopted from seoul as a child thoroughly enjoyed visiting here  she said she hasnt seen some of the items since she was a little girl 
the pho was good at good price  id choose it over pho kim long any day  for 1 its not as busy and a lil bit cheaper  id go there again  with so many pho places in the area its hard to choose but this place had good reviews 
the food was incredible  i never thought i could find good indian food in northeast ohio  the service was so great  they were very sincere and gave us free rice pudding at the end of our meal 
poor waitress service in the casino   bad    you have to wait sooo long that you cant have fun drinking and gambling  oh and we got a lame excuse from the waitress boss   oh they have a large area    ahhh we come to gamble and have fun so we went to the lift bar and buy our drinks   i guess if your not a high roller you dont matter   well im done with this hotel  will try out the venetian hotel check them out    by the way we are hotel guests   
its just a mall  but hey  its a mall with normal mall prices in the middle of the strip  its a convenient place to pop in to pick up something that you may have forgotten at home or to replace that shirt that you ruined the night before 
i love madewell the brand but there is nothing worse to me than when youre trying to shop and the employees have their eyes on you the entire time  i dont know if its because they are slow or bored but its uncomfortable and rude  it made my experience there multiple times rather akward and unenjoyable  online shopping for me 
service needs help  not as attentive as should be or intuitive with urgency  timing  pretzel bun is wayyyy too thick and bread y in my opinion  not a good ratio to the rest of the burger  also  im all for a short skirt but not everyone should be rocking that    just saying  wings are great though 
i have been gone to professor nails since they open and i had try diffident people and all of them are very nice  i really recommend this place because everybody is very professional and courteous  the owner of this place is very nice and always make sure that everything is clean and all the customers are welcome  i went today 6  25  14 and i had paul do my nails the first time and he did a great job that i loved it so much  i am going to start asking for him all the time now on  i love this place 
my husband and i came here for our 20th wedding anniversary  and i couldnt be any more pleased  the service was wonderful  the food was excellent  normally i take pictures of what ive ordered but to be honest my seafood diablo was to amazing to stop for a photo  we had calamari to start was equally as good  the bites of garlic bread heaven with the marinara sauce   to die for     without a doubt the best italian restaurant that ive ever been to 
my roommates and i were letting our place go   we were just so busy with work and school that none of us had the time to give it the deep cleaning that it needed after 6 5 months of 5 people living there  it got to the point where we couldnt walk around in the living room with standing on boxes of ready made mac n cheese  we called maid complete and they sent out a cleaning person at the soonest availability  by the time i got home next  i was amazed  not only was the house clean  it was cleaned than ive ever seen it  grade a service 
second time eating here and each time has been outstanding  fantastic service  top notch food  happy hour offers nice range of foods to choose from and theyre all excellent  alligator was great  shrimp and the mini fondeaux  sp  was all amazing  will be back as often as time and my wallet allows 
great specials  decent service  definitely a local hotspot  board was not current 
finally got to dine here last sunday as a spur of the moment choice  i am so glad that my husband and i chose this night to try morimoto and his menu  i have always been a fan of nobu and iron chef  and i had such a wonderful experience from service to food and dessert  i wasnt thinking about a review when we were there or i would have taken pictures and taken note of the names of the employees that were so accommodating  first off  we had no reservation and it was busy  but the kind manager with long blonde hair was able to situate us in their lounge area  service was wonderful  the tuna pizza was melt in your mouth heavenly  my favorite fish is tuna and the flavor that was packed into this was unreal   i am already craving it  i also really enjoyed the chocolate tart   its a must try  morimoto and the staff lived up to my expectations  and we will be back 
definitely do no recommend this show      is to much money for the price we paid for and if they perform 15 minutes the most playing drums   it was to much      very upset with the performance  
clean ass shop went in here to buy some detox  alot of options  very nice people all the staff i dealt with were very helpful and they know their shit  thanks again i believe ill pass my drug test with flying colors
i really enjoyed my pizza at monicals  to me  having eaten here during my graduate school days  a schoolmate advised me to ask for their french dressing on my pizza  it was absurd  of course  but tasted fantastic  now i wont get it any other way  thanks for the memories  monicals 
do not come here if you are looking for good food  i was really disappointed with the seafood quality  the oysters left a horrible taste in your mouth  i agree with one of the other reviews about the crabs being too salty as well as other dishes  the best part for me was the desert and by that i mean they were just ok average   for seafood price buffet that is not what i was expecting  overall expensive seafood for bad quality  i will not be going there again 
like the food  good beer selection for a small town  the fish fry is worth the trip  hand made cheese curds and poppers  the waitress was great but the bartender was not friendly  guessing because it wasnt her costumer so she didnt care  though she had enough time for her phone 
one of the best burgers in madison  try to go whenever i can  all the sandwiches are great  daily specials and brews make the trip 
this place went beyond my expectations  3 99  for a ice cream cookie sandwich  select your cookie  ice cream and topping  the cookies are warmed fresh in the oven and they have a wide variety  everything was delicious  our favorite and we will return  they also have shakes  ice cream tacos and sundaes 
if i could give this place less then one star i would  its not very often i rate something this low just because i give points for effort but its like this place stopped caring and started serving crap  i ordered a taco chili relleno and enchilada combo the only edible item on my plate was the enchilada   my husband ordered the fajitas and it came on a not a fajita plate just a regular plate with lettuce and pico it was a very sad excuse for a fajita meal  dont waste your time money or gas going to this place  oh and to top off crappy food the service is just as bad as the food 
stopped in during a business trip  will be going back for sure  eric and his team are a class act  the best wings ive ever had 
ordered my food in the drive thru came home to a unpleasant stale cold gordita crunch tacos and possibly kangaroo meat   such a disappointment this location taco bell needs good quality food 
the urgent care is clean  the friendly staff  and the doctors listen to you  wait time is never too long  especially compared to other places  if you have to go to an urgent care facility go to this one 
very yummy and fresh  this is my go to place if i want mexican food 
this was our favorite meal in montreal  the space is wonderful   full of energy and very warm  it gets a little loud  but the tables are intimate and cozy  food was spectacular   great variety  super seasonal  great for vegetarians and omnivores alike  my one critique is how long it took to get our food  a few tables sat at around the same time as us  and though the service was warm and attentive  i couldnt help but feel frustrated at how long it took to receive our appetizers  our server was apologetic  and the delicious food made up for it 
well apparently waxhaw creamery does not need any more business since i was told that they have not returned my voicemails because they are too busy   even when i finally spoke to an usually rude young lady and asked why my calls were not being returned  she stated that they were  too busy to answer the phone    i dont own a business but im pretty sure thats not how to run one 
pretty good food   my yardstick  if they have it  is corned beef hash  and it wasnt the best ive had nor the worst   satisfying   my co diners had crepes and pancakes which they raved about   i especially liked that the crepes requested werent on the menu and they were more than accommodating   a little pricey for breakfast  and as mentioned in other reviews  the interior is really awful   not warm and inviting at all 
i love this place  salud is everything that is right about the noda area  jason does a great job of keeping a top quality selection of brews at good prices on the shelf  his knowledge of the product is also top notch and its nice to be able to find some real gems that cant be found around town at his shop  really been enjoying his tastings from different breweries around the country with the empanadas for a nice little bite to eat while enjoying good company    with heist getting ready to open its doors and with noda brewing and birdsong all just a stones throw away noda is quickly becoming the place to be for beer lovers in charlotte  i suggest making a trip up to pick up some great things to bring home and hit a couple local tap rooms in the area  or just pull up to the bar in salud and try one of the many beers he has cold or on tap 
so glad this place has closed   the owner was terrible   a bunch of  friends went there for a birthday celebration and the owner was soooo rude   very embarrassing situation for all my friends    i went to every social media outlet to warn people about the establishment
my husband and i enjoyed our  high tea  vary much  the food was great and the tea was tasty 
best kabob in town  i wish i could give more stars  this is authentic afghan food  great choices and great food  i will definitely come back 
service was good as was the food  portions were great  we ordered a bit too much the first time so when we go back we will chose less  lots of leftovers 
i locked my keys in my car and called several locksmiths prior to calling acme  all the people i spoke with at the previous places were very rude and made me feel like i was bothering them  none of them could provide me with an exact fee quote  stating that the price  starts at  ____ and goes up from there   one place even hung up on me after i said i would call them back if nothing else worked out   i was already frustrated when i called acme  the woman i spoke with on the phone was very nice and helpful and put me at ease  she was able to quote me a very reasonable flat fee and stated they could be out within the hour  i agreed to these terms and met with ryan in about 45 minutes  he got into my car in just a few minutes and he was really nice and professional about the whole thing  i highly recommend going with these folks if you need a locksmith 
one of the nicest airports i have been to  very pleasing to the eyes very clean also   i think it has a friendly way about it  easy to navigate
definitely one of the best places weve eaten in a long time   food was to die for  loved the delicious appetizers  social boards   duck and ribs were amazing   the chocolate mousse was also to die for  
this place is great    the owner came around and introduced himself and the staff were attentive and friendly  my in laws live close so we could walk and enjoy the live music  they have some outdoor seating and you can still hear the music 
this was my second time here  1stin the summer and first for the sunset  we walked the beach looking for glass and then sat in the rocks to watch the amazing sunset  there were children  families  and dogs playing in the water  it was very busy but we felt like it was just the too of us 
very cool checking out the castle and taking a hike  pretty funny to watch all the wedding parties  fighting it out to take pictures  this is a one and done place 
you should go once every season to experience the beauty  majesty and power of nature 
dr  dave and his wife vicki live what they preach   they are genuinely concerned about their patients  and are two of the most knowledgeable and kind people i have ever met   my daughter  who is 4  and i feel safe  loved  and important each week when we have our appointment   the mancusos are in this business out of pure love  not for money like some other chiropractors we have been to   amazing people all around 
this dunkin donuts is extremely inconsistent   sometimes they are spot on  and other times it is absolutely a nightmare   this morning was one of the nightmares    when i went with my 4 year old at 6 am they had no coffee brewed   huh   youre a coffee shop    its 6 am and you dont have any coffee   they then proceeded to get my order wrong and forget my 4 year olds wrap   the girl at the window dropped my credit card and i had a very difficult time retrieving it as it went under my car   they are often out of bagels and decaf in the evenings   i have given them enough chances to get it right  and they just cant   sadly  i wont be going back there again 
in good weather  oloroso is my favourite place to go for a drink in edinburgh because the terrace offers a lovely view and environment  especially when im entertaining foreign guests  ive only ever had snacks and drinks here so i cant review the food  their wine list offers a good range of varieties and prices  including by the glass  every cocktail weve had there has been excellent  my experiences with service has been consistently fine  there when you want it  but not hovering around constantly  i have never found it particularly snooty or gotten the sense that its a place to pose like some other reviewers have  though i would certainly call it an upmarket environment  the entrance is fun when youre taking guests there for the first time as it seems rather secret 
no wow moment for me  underwhelming at best  after reading rave reviews and being down the street from a sushi place i frequent  i had to try it   pros   greeted instantly and lots of staff for such a small resto offered green tea even though i was ordering takeout food was ready in 5 8 minutes  arrived around 5pm on a weekday  brown rice on request  extra dollar for each maki roll  considered butchery by some however health trumps after nearly a week of eating out  order brown when offered on the menu   cons  small maki rolls  was aware based on the reviews however the actual maki ingredients used were sparse ordered 3 maki rolls had one small serving of wasabi  spicy salmon  no spicy mayo could be detected among the few traces of salmon  barely visible to the human eye  yam tempura with avocado  equal proportion of yam and avocado  sauce on top brought out the sweetness of the yam  great flavours  dragon maki  gold  salmon   the roll was smaller than standard maki offered elsewhere  the top pieces of salmon and avocado only covered half of the maki roll  inside a couple slivers of cucumber  typically avocado is used in dragon rolls that ive tried in other sushi joints   overall  the size would be understandable if the actual ingredients used in the maki were of quality and substance  i felt like i was eating brown rice and seaweed and could not tell you if the salmon was fresh or not as there was hardly any in there   spending  30 after tax  a hefty price for the size and skimpiness of ingredients used   i am hoping this was a bad chance encounter as some yelpers have indicated lack of consistency 
freshly baked daily  warm and gooey buns of cinnamon goodness  youll want to get your hands on these buns   open wednesday sunday 8 am till sell out  check out their social media for updates as they are flying off the counter  rosensbuns
omg  the pizza was amazing  what a great concept  4 different restaurants in one location 
best sauce by far   the meals are amazing and good sized  ida is a very good cook and has a charming personality  she has no problems expressing herself   while i was there she was trying to check give someone directions over the phone  apparently the person was talking over her so she told them to shutup and listen  they arrived 10 minutes later   shell do custom menus for parties  they call it family style  
i like their pizza and subs  the large meatball sub is good and really two meals in one  
went here with family and they were far from closed  8 00 pm     we were brought chips but we were not greeted again for another 15 minutes   not even a drink order  all the young servers were playing around in the kitchen and ignoring the guests   after not having drinks after almost 20 minutes and multiple servers walking past us laughing  we left without service  terrible experience 
i have only been here once  on an early sunday evening after a few friends and i walked over after a d backs game  it was before the evening comedy show crowd arrived  this is the reason i listed noise as average  as i wasnt there when live music was playing    i like the setup of the place  with an outer bar area in an all glass area  gorgeous view of downtown  the interior bar  like the outer bar  has over 50  i think around 60  taps  they have everything from your mass brewed american lagers  pilsners  pbr  bud  coors  miller  etc  and a good selection for the beer geek  snob  sierra nevada  stone  dogfish head  etc   if you  over several visits  choose to consume one of each  you get two vip tickets to stand up live  the attached comedy club   the interior bar area has some different style seating arrangements  booths that face towards the bar  high seat tables  and a nice wraparound bar by all the taps  there are a couple of tvs for sporting events and whatnot  but this is meant more for background sites than to be that place you go to hear the commentators during a game  i dont get the impression this place is meant to be the hangout during the game  but a great after game spot     the food was very good  we had a cheese pizza with sun dried tomatoes  basil oil  tasty   we also got to try a cuban sandwich pizza  thats right  if you love the pork  cheese  swiss   and pickles of a cuban sandwich  you will love this pizza  overall the beer and food rate from a 4 5    the owner  who spoke to me and my friends about our first impressions   peder the head chef  and the on duty manager  michelle   were very friendly and answered all our questions  breanne  sp   was a very nice  and knowledgeable server  all of the waitstaff was very nice to my friends and i  even when we started to wear out our welcome     i enjoyed my time here and look forward to going back to complete my beer list  i want to come here during a lunch  and during live music  weekend to make sure i have a complete picture of the place before giving it a five  however  my first impressions are that i will ultimately do just that 
this place rocks  i brought my car here because of a cracked radiator along with several other issues  they were able to match the price of an online mechanic service   and get the repair done the very same day  the owner stayed late just for me so that i could come pick up my vehicle which was nice   the car came back 100  problems fixed  competitive price   great same day service  and very knowledgeable  honest and friendly staff of mechanic and techs 
excellent meats  pastas and baked goods in the main building  produce vendors are scammers  sold us a bunch of rotten fruits and vegetables  kinda ruined an overall great shopping experience  wish i could write a separate review for them because the other vendors are great 
i almost gave this place 5 stars  but i had something relatively minor done and it was done to my satisfaction  but i m not sure what their work is like on larger jobs like hemming   so 4 stars seems fair    i needed a tailor to create two more button holes for adjustable straps and i originally tried to take it to my normal tailor on the other side of durango  but they told me they didn t have a button hole machine  what   i was like  sad face   i yelped the drycleaners next door to this spot and figured they would have an alterations person  when i showed up  i accidentally dropped off my item at alterations by edwin i must have been super out of it that day and later realized i hadnt left my item at the drycleaners at all doh      this spot is small and what i would expect for a tiny operation and i m just fine with that  i walked in and the gentlemen that helped me was really nice  told me the cost  tagged my item  and i was on my way with a ticket that didn t even have the business name on it  so i literally had no idea what business the ticket came from   he told me it would be ready in two days and i left it for like two weeks i m that person   when i picked it up  it was another gentlemen  equally as friendly  pay and pick up was a breeze  my item turned out great and i thought the price for the work was fair    overall  i would definitely go back to this spot for more alternations    first to review  put you on the map  alterations by edwin  do a good job   
had luch here with the family yesterday the 26  2 we normaly go to montanas but decided to try something new  had never been before the service was fine but the food was lacking both my husband and i had the noodle bowl  huge portions  but there was not enough sauce it was a bit bland with the teryaki sauce my husband took the sweet and spicy and it was just ok  the atmospher was ok but i dont know if we will be going back
omg  mutt dog one of the best dogs ive ever had  period  and the elote fries were delicious  need a cheap  tasty lunch on the vegas strip  beat a path to dirt dog 
highly recommended  i had an absolutely amazing time here  as a concierge  i have the opportunity of experiencing our city as a tourist and have tried practically everything  top shot was by far the most fun ive had here in las vegas   to start  the customer service is outstanding  im a novice with guns  my brother is experienced and enjoys frequenting ranges  the instructors there made us both feel very comfortable and welcome  giving me thorough direction while not being redundant with my brother   the first thing we did was the virtual trainer which is where they will ensure you know how to properly hold the gun  this is done with a weighted  video game style gun that gives the feel of a real gun    we then went to the simulation room  they fitted us with a vest to put our clips in  they gave us another gun and instructed that this would be a home invasion simulation  the gun was heavy  similar to the gun i had used for the virtual trainer  when the shell came flying out during practice it was very thrilling because i had the great combination of using a real gun while playing video games  a gamers dream  woot    the shells they use are a specialty non lethal ammunition  after the home invasion simulation we went on to zombies with a rifle and that was my favorite of the two   i love zombie games   at this point im already having the time of my life and was extremely excited to do the high voltage gun battle with my brother  the instructor stated most ladies choose a one and most gentleman choose a three  i wasnt about to let my brother outdo me so i chose a three as well  they test out the shock level before you play by shooting you  level three was very tolerable until you get shot in the back 3 times in a row by your older brother in the arena lol   he got me 8 times total  no mercy    they have yearly memberships that you can purchase  100 for the year  then you just pay for the ammo  which i will be doing on my next visit   there is also a ladies night every 3rd tuesday and the price is very reasonable    tldr  if you like guns and  or video games  go  its an absolute must 
ive always had an awesome experience here   trick is to sit at the bar  you cant beat this as a local watering hole  staff are amazing  warm and inviting  casual or dressy  very cool vibe to this place without the pretentiousness found at most queen st hip spots  great music  great vibe  basically no bullshit  really a cool local highly recommend the lamb  its a favourite of mine  simple and affordable favourite is the rigatoni and tomato sauce  you can order it off the menu and its always great  the shrimp and risotto is lovely too often i just have the rapini or asparagus side with a cocktail at the bar  yan  ian  is exceptional  zack is always awesome and marty the flamboyant server is hilarious  and overall they are all generous  ive been gifted many a shot here  when getting dessert get the berries and cream with port on top  amazing 
jess is amazing on bar  very accommodating  with flavours and needs in s cocktail  so amazing at her craft
great pub environment with lounge taste  casual and yet candlelit  very charming place to grab wine and oysters or pub grub 
a much lesser 416 snack bar  they have decorated their place exactly like it  modern  wood finishes  candles etc  i really wanted to like this place but no sparkling wine  no real wine glasses   i liked that they carried lagavulin scotch  and my boyfriend had his dalwhinnie scotch whisky  still id rather order it from ceili cottage a block east with some oysters or chicken pot pie  the food here sucks  theyve done everything decorative right down to the little mason jar pate order  but what a disappointment when you take a bite  and god help you  stay away from the dark and stormy  gross i love kracken and i love ginger beer but it does not make for a good combo  if you want to go in for a beer i guess youre safe but i must emphasize theres much better places to go on the block  really hope they improve because many times theyre the only place open 
went for dinner with a friend of mine last night  we went because he was in the area doing rock climbing so i figured why not give this place a try  first off  the restaurant is in a plaza and it can be easy to miss if you are driving along wilson avenue  the outside is a bit plain  however  when you enter  it has that old home character  the carpet is a bit worn  and the walls could use a fresh look  however  dont let the decor fool you  the food and service is good  i had the minestrone soup and lasagna  the soup had a lot of flavour  i guess this is how authentic minestrone soup is supposed to taste like  the lasagna was a large portion  i enjoyed it  it was simple  but again full of flavour  our waiter was friendly and punctual  our waters were always filled and the bread was always on the table  overall  a good restaurant  on a saturday night  it should have been full  but only about a third of the restaurant was filled  a place worth trying 
came here to try out some sandwiches and salad  they were a little better than average  i would have given it 3 5 stars because for a bakery it had a lot of variety of breads and pastries  the negatives were  dirty bathrooms  tables were not clean  and less than average value  for the price one would expect better sandwiches  perhaps sandwiches and salads are not their specialty  i shall try their breads next time 
met up with a bunch of friends here on a friday night  the place was hopping  one hour wait  i know  the food better be damn good if im going to wait an hour  but hey  the drinks were good  and cheap so i was happy while a waited  had the pan fried walleye  very good  came with good slaw  a roll and ample  delicious hash browns for  14  the pan fried option is great  not many restaurants do that  love that i can have a good meal  a vodka buzz then go shopping at the macys and anthropologie 
this week has been hell week at work  baby has 4 teething coming in at once   after i gave him his new teething items  i purchased his mood instantly changed   thank you  to the two ladies working for taking the time and walking me through all of your different natural teething baby items   to all my mommy    nanny friends i highly recommend this store  
well  where do i start   i started this challenge with my best friend  and had a lot of mixed emotions  i had every doubt in the world that it wouldnt work  and that i would fail because me and working out and following a meal plan never worked before  but i decided to take the challenge and have nothing but good things to say  it has taught me discipline  i have met some very cool people  i feel better mentally  physically and emotionally  and the trainers are nothing short of amazing  they give all the help and support needed to beat the challenge and so much more  not to mention they make working out super fun  i actually enjoy going to the workouts  and i would have never said that before starting here  i would recommend this place to anyone even if you dont have weight to lose and just want somewhere to go and be active 
i thought i had called zerorez  and they said they were zerorez several times   sadly after spending  333 and having to tear out 3 rooms of carpet i did some digging today and found it was in fact desert carpet   and now i read all the reviews of how bad they are   nathan is deplorable  do not use this company     ill take them to court  and to the news  its embarrassing to be scammed but i dont want anyone else to go through this 
this place was just    okay  first id like to say that my bridal consultant  dont remember her name   sorry  was really nice and helpful  but to me most of the other saleswomen had  desperation  all over their faces  dont know if they work off of commission  or if the higher ups are just slave laborers  or what  but im sure some of them wouldve killed for a sale   i found a few dresses i liked  but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot  so i decided to wait on it  i ended up finding a dress i liked better for about 1  3 of the price somewhere else  i notified davids bridal  thanks but no thanks  about 6 months ago  to this day i still get calls to my cell phone asking me to  come back in and try on the dress     theyre like the telemarketers of the bridal world  so annoying  plus their accessories are so expensive  and very cookie cutter  id go somewhere else  unless youre new to this and need some ideas 
had special of the day fish and chips and smoked turkey  located inside westgate hotel and casino makes for a vibrant ambience  good food and good service 
we stoped off and wanted breakfast and we were not sad  1st of all this is a cutest looking place we had the pleasure of being seated in alexs section  she took care of us very well and got us food and  tea and it was great  i had there garlic bacon jam toast which is to die for  also there breakfast mac and cheese comes with a fried egg on top it was with out a doubt sooo delicious and sinful the hubby had the rollins that is an amazing breaded chicken sandwich with bacon and bacon jam  all in all wonderful dining experience  always remember yummmm is a great incentive for food 
we had a fantastic anniversary dinner here on jan 1st and i will say the pho was delicious i had mine with flank steak and brisket my hubby had the oxtail fried rice with an egg   his 1st sunny side egg  the service was fantastic and the people were soon happy to give us there option on what was good and the lady with the purple hair was sweet
we ate here on the 23th and our server jon was great  he gave some great infoe on different things on the menu we wanted to order  my husband had a burger i had the pot pie   now be ready because the portions are beyond huge but my goodness the food was great  the meal started out with home made biscuits with honey butter and these were the size of a soft ball   great meal come hungry and enjoy every moment 
bend over backward service  margherita pizza to die for  great wine selection  good ambiance  yum 
got the triple green delight one night early in my madison stay  looking for a quick and cheap dinner  and it was quick and cheap   7 10  i think   order is broccoli  snap peas  and green beans over fried rice with a reasonably spicy sauce  it did not reinvent my concept of the possibilities for chinese carryout  but neither did it let me down  the portions were big  the veggies seemed freshly cooked  and i was good to go  the store was not spotless  but neither did it fill me with fear  although the three star average for this business has been achieved by wildly divergent nostalgia trips and horror stories  between them they got the average of my experience just about right  you  asian kitchen  were a ok to me  and were i hungry or drunk  a full time resident of madison  and in need of comfort  i just might have come knocking on your door a second time 
wine and truffles were great  need to be on the  menu permanently  very friendly and knowledgeable staff  great select of wine with good prices  will be back soon for more tasting 
im new to the area and went here based on yelp reviews and the approximately to my house  excellent customer service all around  family owned  honest  did a great job fixing my car  i will definitely go back here for such great service 
place is old school  with great service and awesome food  and homemade jelly  and homemade cinnamon rolls 
i really wish i could give this place more stars  i absolutely love the food here and convenience of ordering online  this is my second time doing so  i arrive on time that is provided on the app  this is the second time the food hasnt been done  this is the second time i arrived to pick up the meal i paid for and the staff acts irritated that they have to prepare a meal  the first time everyone was in the back of the restaurant and i had to wait ten minutes before i was even greeted  the only reason i may try mad greens in another location is because of the food  horrible customer service 
the stylistic can be fresh out of school   management does not stand behind correcting a bad hair cut by a green stylist  owner will not return calls   not a very good way to treat a customer of 18 months for me any my boy     disappointed
i love afghani food and places like n   k are why    you order off of takeout menus and pay before you sit down  youll get a buzzer and thats when you know to go up and get your food    i usually get the boneless chicken breast kebab with rice   ive always found this quick service restaurant to be clean and inviting  with a great ambience  fun decals     the food has always been flavourful and i absolutely love their naan  they bring it fresh and warm 
i have been here to the see the suns play  i was in the nose bleed seats and there was not a bad seat  i did not know what to expect for a concert  i was here to see neil diamonds 50th tour  the seat i purchased was to the side of the stage and  i thought that the seat would be limiting on the view  ok  i was here to hear the live music   the seat was surprising good  neil diamon for 76 years young still has a strong voice  the concert was two hours with just neil diamond and his band and there was no intermission  a great performance  i am glad that i went to see a great american singer song writer 
meh   tropicana got a multi million dollar renovation  by the looks of it  it definitely needed one badly since even after the renovation it was still kinda crappy  dont get me wrong  parts of it were nice  the outdoor pool space looked like it was nice  though since it is closed during the winter time  it didnt make a difference for my stay   though they still do charge you that  14 95 resort fee anyways   the check in counter area looked cool  with its white walls and colored lights    but i think that was about it  our room was not much to write about  the renovations didnt make it to our bathroom  and probably didnt make it to other parts of our hotel room either  if it did  i really couldnt tell    you get what you pay for  right  well  unfortunately we were there for super bowl weekend  which means we paid a lot  and got a little in return  to cap it off  when i called down to the front desk  i waited on the line for 5 minutes   and no one picked up  i tried again   waited for another 5 minutes   and then finally someone picked up  oh  and it sounded like she was doing me a favor  picking up my call   oh well  better luck in vegas next time 
i know that no one really likes going to the airport now a days  you feel more like a piece of cattle working its way through a stockyard then a valued customer  however this airport certainly does not make that experience any better  most of the facility is under construction  but there is dust and dangerous construction equipment like pickaxes just strewn all about  the security line took almost an hour because they only had one woman checking the ids at the end of the line  creating a bottleneck to get to the security scanners  at the very end of my hour  as i was nearing the destination three more people suddenly set up id checking booths  why did it take so long for them to realize that they were undermanned  bathrooms at this airport are few and far between  i looked  in the a terminal  there were bathrooms at a3     and a25  i dont know how recently anyone reading this has been to an airport  but 22 gates is a really long distance to walk to go to the bathroom  my flight was going out of a7  so i was not completely out of luck    but i feel for people that had a gate address in the teens   there were not a lot of choices for food or snacking  the construction had blocked off whole sides of the terminal and it seems like the restaurants had just closed   i dont usually have much choice where my flights connect into  but personally i would not want to have to stop at this airport again anytime soon  or maybe i will check back and see if they are done with all this awful construction that takes away so many amenities 
the previous review mustve been a long time ago  because the staff there now  is very knowledgeable and helpful  a newly remodeled store with all the latest gadgets   and a 4k tv that sucks you into a dtv experience   great place to go for anything at t 
in n out burger never disappoints  and this location was no different  yes they are always busy but i am always amazed at how quickly you get your food considering the amount of people that are always there  the employees are always extremely friendly and seem happy to be there and the food is always excellent  double double with animal style fries is my favorite 
great tacos and burritos on the cheap  happy hour rates are great and generally much longer than an hour  easy to miss location   worth the stop 
i surprised my husband with a renewal  ceremony on his birthday of march 13  2016   i set the appointment online   everything  was taken care of in advance   the chapel was beautiful  the officiant made us feel at ease and the photographer was great   all the staff are professional  friendly and went out of their way to make this day special   no hidden fees  very easy to find  and great parking 
its a nice stop if youre in the area  its smaller than the german christmas market at mecklenberg brewery   had random trinkets to buy  alcohol  cider  and food  i had an apple streusel  which was nice and flaky  they also have brats  pretzels  nuts  and mini donuts    honestly  the food and drink options were the best part for a quick snack   unfortunately  too cold to stand outside for too long 
did not disappoint  love the multiple pools and tubs  the best thing is that you can walk around without feeling self conscious that people are staring at you    the saunas i dont really care for  but thats because i felt like a roasting potato   unfortunately  they raised the day pass price to  55 but its worth it to go at least once 
i like this place  bar food  picnic tables  and lots of games    i tried the tots and the latkes  both very tasty  i think i might have overdone it on the fried food that night   park for free in the garage across the street if you want to bar hop  the parking on site is only if youre staying at vbgb only 
this is a good resort if youre older than 30 and have a family  its located along what looked like a  resort strip  in scottsdale  there isnt much else around except surburbia  so its pretty boring for a single person    the good  gorgeous pools  open lounge area  service  nice rooms  free parking    bad  dont get a room on the first floor or youll hear all the noise from the lobby bar  restaurant and smell incense and whatever food theyre cooking out there  first night i smelled incense  wedding parties  and the 2nd day it smelled like tuna fish sandwich  just weird   also  they dont have enough lighting in the parking lot at night 
finding this place was a total fluke as they have a back enterace which i thought was an apartment building  there were people eating at tables in an open air type patio which reminded me of san fran  i heard loud music  saw an incredible fish tank  and had to check it out  shocked to find it was a donut shop since it seemed to be  hip   didnt know such a thing existed   wasnt hungry  but i wasnt going to leave without trying one of their many unique donuts  crazy combinations  poptart inside a donut  whod of thunk  i got the strawberry  shortcake  or was it strawberry shortpuff  as it was loaded with whipped deliciousness topped with strawberries  spent 10 minutes in bathroom taking photos  check this place out  must pay for parking  but no big deal  machines take all forms of payment  worth it 
oh my  i am so impressed by superb maids  the house was so much in need of deep cleaning  that i needed to call services  first off  natalie responded so quick in comparison to all the companies ive reached out to  second  they booked me right away with ease and was very accommodating  when i say accommodating  the employees went above and beyond  i asked for extra services such as oven cleaning  and even laundry the last minute  i get a phone call right away to confirm  my house was such a mess for the past week of travel  and work   and now it looks like a home  staff was so friendly  eager and in deed helpful 
have always heard nightmare stories about these warranties and im currently experiencing just that  they are trying to get out of warranty work due to the cost  the technician has shown them everything to know why the issue is occurring and they are constantly arguing about it  going on week 3 of not having my car now and it is getting out of hand  completely dissatisfied and wont be doing this again   i would have expected better customer service but have yet to see that either 
straight up   this steakhouse will blow your mind   after it took us three amazing appetizers   shrimp neptune  bacon wrapped scallops and stuffed mushrooms   we were finally able to decide on our meals   the rib steak was the best   full and juicy   perfect   pure  what else do you say   you say try the blue filet   it will blow your mind with all favors        morgan was hands down the best server we have had the pleasure of dining with   i promise if you eat here  and morgan is your server  you will be ecstatic with her      do not pass this one up   
this is the worst service in the world  this place is for people that enjoy dingleberries  everyone that works here should die  all you do is mess up orders  i ordered a bbq bacon whopper and you give me a  rodeo burger     i didnt know deaf people are allowed to work there  if you wanted sign language i wouldve told stone cold steve austin to give you some  i hope a disturbed child craps in your deepfryer therefore giving you the slightest edge because your food is complete garbage  i am going to eat this trash burger you call  food  because you guys are bunch of wastemans that can get boxed 
i have never rented a bounce house before and received mr  bs by referral  did an awesome job from the start  everyone i dealt with was professional and answered all my questions  the guy who set up  kept in contact and told me to call when i was done  highly recommend their services  i will only use them in the future 
this is our weekly go to place  we love the food and the service  alyssa and lori are the best bartenders you could ask for  if you want a place that feels like family from the moment you walk in  try vitos 
for being a pakistani restaurant that is as customer focused as they are and for serving the most heavenly food on all the earth  nehari  i give extra points   very friendly people  very clean and comfortable environment  but best of all the steaming bowls of nehari goodness  i was floating on air   thanks karahi point 
last night was my first time here and i will come back again  starting out with the salad   the bread they were so good the food was superb so delicious out of this world  tricia was our waitress and she has great customer service skills  i felt like i was in the godfather movie the way the restaurant was set up i just loved it
just want to let you know that arora at farmboys is like amazing she goes over and above shes help me on several occasions i go there two to three times a week and she is absolutely phenomenal kudos to you girl keep up the good work
two words to describe game truck  awesome experience   they were on time very helpful and i would definitely use game truck again
i highly recommend dc auto luxury window tinting  i read the great reviews other customers wrote which is why i had my suv tinted here  after my experience  it is clear why this company us such amazing reviews  dave was very professional  knowledgeable  and friendly  he explained each product  answered all my questions  and helped me select the perfect product for my vehicle   i am very pleased with the quality job they did and how incredible my windows look 
oh man  you have found the best sushi place in town  we dont waste our time going anywhere else   people  get there  my husband and i are super picky about sushi    we care about freshness  originality  cost  and chef friendliness    this place has it all   the ayce is really affordable and still offers original rolls  appetizers  they also will do a half roll so that you can try more things  get the japanese nachos  you wont be sorry  
never had chicago style deep dish pizza before and wow    so good and the sauce is incredible  we had pepperoni  mushroom  black olive and spinach  the crust is chewy and good and cradles the cheese  toppings and sauce over the top  you gotta try it   
when my mom came to visit me in montreal we went to le local for my birthday and it was one of the most amazing meals of my life  it wouldnt be a place that i could afford to go very often  but when my parents want to treat me to a great meal  this is always my first choice  i made some excellent meal choices  i would highly suggest the grilled octopus salad  the duck leg confit  and the banane et chocolat to finish it off  it was a lovely meal  and we were so lucky to enjoy it on the beautiful terrace as the sun set  everything was cooked to perfection  and it is an excellent place for adventurous eaters because the menu is quite extravagant 
i love everyone that works here  both dr kim and his staff are extremely welcoming  and ive been coming ever since i was a little kid  i wouldnt ever think of switching to another dentist  as pointe north dental is the best it will ever get  thank you dr kim and staff for being so friendly and caring at every appointment i go to  
worst serviced i ever had  staff name aylin was very rude  my order took over 30 minutes at drive thru  when i tried to talk to the staff she was so rude and shut the window on me  cant believe it  never going back again 
i stopped in with my wife last night  as we are both new to the city and were celebrating our anniversary  the food was great  however  the staff went out of their way to go above and beyond my expectations  they were friendly and prompt and the manager made us feel important as patrons 
you can overlook a lot of things when the food is good however the food was terrible  our waiter was under the influence of something  and high  the place is kind of dirty  they have a box fan hanging from the ceiling as a  ceiling fan   we are from our of town and travel often  on average 12days a month  and use yelp as a guide to great food  unfortunately this is not it  oh and there was a 30 45 min line outside that we waited in just to have terrible service and mediocre at best food 
i played 2 rooms of 4 and they were both quite good   they have a few good uses of technology and the puzzle variety is good   the puzzle logic and organization of rooms is currently one of the best amongst gta competitors   this place would rank in the top compared to equivalent scale puzzle room businesses   would go back again 
i always make sure to eat here whenever were in vegas  portions are massive and it helps battle the hangover  get the french toast ambrosia  youll thank me 
amazing the best sushi in vegas  fish is so fresh and filling  the rolls are filled with tons of fish and not as much rice as other sushi places
diana does outstanding work  i have had her do two complete houses in the last 10 years  her customer service is superior as is the quality of installation  you cant go wrong calling diana and her daughter 
my husband has been telling me about this place for years  and since they are only open for lunch i have never had a chance to eat here  well i finally had my chance  and he was right  the decor is nothing fancy  but the service is friendly and the food is amazing    i had the four rib combo with two sides  the ribs were delicious  and generously slathered with a great bbq sauce  these were some of the best ribs i have ever had  as for sides  i got the garlic mash potatoes and the blue cheese cole slaw  the portions for the sides are a good size  the cole slaw was good  but the garlic mash potatoes were to die for  my husband ordered the thick sliced brisket and loved it  it was very tasty and tender  he also had the mashed potatoes as well as the grilled vegetables  he said they were very tender  if you love great bbq this is the place to come and eat 
it was a horrible experience  upon enter the room  we discovered some thousand years old stains in the tub   bed sheets  if its something small we can just let that go but it was so obvious  try to get someone to assist never easy  i think its faster if i ran down to the room service grab a bed sheet and change it myself  will get to the power outage in a bit    no hot water in the shower   water pressure took a dump for three days  nobody care to fix it neither  we checked in around 8pm on oct 31st  2016  soon found out there is no hot water in the shower at 10pm  contacted the front desk  they just gave us a run around  listening to their boring on hold music for the longest time  transferred to few different department and finally told us someone will be there within 20 minutes   yeah right   someone knock on the door 3 hours later  without any repair done  just told us to turn on hot water in the sink and tub for 15 minutes and we will have hot water  that doesnt seems to work  the guy said he will go get parts and that was the end of it   end up we had to shower in north pole   repeated the same cycle again on the second night   contact front desk  put on hold  wait for someone to show up and that was 3am  replaced the valve and we finally can take hot shower now   thats a yay   yay too soon  next morning power outage at around 9 30am and nobody knows whats going on  hotel staffs walking around in the pitch black hall way with the flash light from their mobile phone telling everyone to calm down  luckily we live on the 5  f  without any backup lighting anywhere  walking flights of stairs with only the flash light from our cell phones  no sign no indications of where the stairs lead to  finally see the light from the emergency exit  it was the loading area in the back of the hotel or some sort  walk around the whole building try to get to the front desk but it was all blocked off  no one can enter the hotel until further notice  we cant get our luggage until 11pm   will not recommend anyone to stay at paris las vegas hotel   casino ever  even if they offer free room 
i didnt want to drive to china town  so we opted for this place   their boba alone is the peeeerfect amount of density and chewiness   and taste  and they have plenty of different flavors for tea or slush  i had the mango slush   which want as good as kung fu teas mango slush  but i can appreciate a good flavor  especially for not wanting to drive 15 minutes further   my friend also had the avocado one  which was just as delicious   overall  i enjoyed this place a lot  the workers were really friendly and the boba was yummy  im glad we now have some good boba on the sw side of town 
this spot right here is good to go with me  ordered the turkey avacdo grilled cheese sandwhich and man that was good  two thumbs up guy when i am n vegas i will be stopping by
first off  i loved their comfy red leather stools and booths   i got the classic burger with cheddar cheese  because i feel that is a good way to compare burger restaurants  i agree with some of the previous posters that the burger was a bit on the dryer  well done side compared to some of the amazing burgers ive had before  and the bun was on the bigger side  a less cooked burger  and a smaller bun  would do wonders for this place   id go back because i work in the area  not a bad burger  but i wouldnt make a special trip to go there  it was better than big smoke on their worst days  but not as good as big smoke on their best   the best burger in toronto for me still remains the burgers priest 
if you are looking for an oyster joint in toronto than this place is for you  when i went  i was hardly an expert on oysters  so i relied on the knowledge of my server  i mentioned how we knew malbec oysters were supposed to be good  but he suggested a different east coast oyster from new bruinswick that they had just gotten in  he stated that in his opinion it tasted better and it was cheaper  sold  i really appreciate places that do not try to oversell the clientele  our server totally hooked us up as they were quite good  and all of the three sauce accompaniments were great  we also got a plate of fries  and i would put them up at some of the best fries in the city  they are very thin and crispy  and come with your choice of mayo  curry  chipotle  etc   we also got some coleslaw which was loaded with dill and was a good pairing with the seafood fair that they offer 
ive literally gone to this place 5x every week this past summer   hands down the best overall ice cream experience you can hope for  in fact this place should be the poster child for going out for ice cream    if you are ever in the junction please check it out  itll put a smile on your face  and bring out the kid in you   salted caramel is a personal fav  stick to the regular sized scoop unless you plan on skipping a meal
everything about this little gem in liberty village is fantastic  the food is fresh  flavourful and the menu is constantly enhanced by new items  the owners are as passionate about their food and wine as they are about providing great  personalized service  it feels more like being the honoured guest in their home then restaurant service  every time i come to ciao europa im treated to a complimentary taste of wine or mouthwatering dessert  tonight  it was both 
saw this initially on my facebook feed and planned a trip here  the wait line wrapped to the door  dessert and presentation was all worth the wait 
for starters  we waited four hours for our pizza  yes  i expected a long wait  but this was ridiculous    in the meanwhile we waited at the bar  which had a poor beer  wine list and rude  inattentive  unknowledgeable servers   when we finally got seated  the service was better  the wine list was atrocious   were talking about 15 selection total  and only one from southern italy  one beer on tap    we had a caprese salad that was only mediocre  the tomatoes were rather flavorless although the were supposedly locally grown  finally  the pizza was good  although not life changing  it was probably not even the best pizza ive ever had 
my primary gripe here is with the ambiance  not with the coffee   after receiving my coffee and looking for a nice place to sit and read for a couple hours  i assumed that the austere decor was because i was in the  study section   however  after looking in the other rooms  i began to wonder if i had actually stumbled into a high school cafeteria   the seating consists of old  uncomfortable chairs and tables organized in a grid format  no comfy chairs  no couches or coffee tables  no art on the walls or anything to make it feel friendly and inviting  i opted to sit outside  my latte was mediocre  i had initially requested a decaf mocha  but apparently they are unable to make those  my croissant tasted like a piece of bread that had been twisted to look like a croissant 
first of all  robin our server was fantastic  she was friendly  funny  knowledgeable  and didnt steer us wrong on any of her suggestions  my  friend and i just tried this place for the first time because of the bacon board appetizer  it was absolutely delicious  i started with their mojito  which was one of the best i have ever had  my friend tried some if the different moonshine flavors amd the copy cat cocktail  she enjoyed all of her beverage choices  i then had the house smoked turkey open face sandwich and my friend had the crispy chi ken sandwich  we both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches  lastly  we shared the peach and blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream  it was delicious and a great summer dessert 
i love the viva salad   very healthy and the lettuce is cold and the chicken is hot  amazing service as well   we always get their frozen blended mocks  awesome  
wow amazing steak top notch service whole experience a plus sides are generous delicious
zero stars if i could  waited over an hour for our overpriced inauthentic food  its good but for the price you pay i would expect so much better  dont expect the chips and salsa to be complimentary either we were surprised with 7 99 on our bill for those bad boys  can honestly say the chips and salsa were probably the best part of the whole experience  the only food article that made it out promptly and were really good  to make things even better if you still decided to come here dont come as a group because guess who cant split your bill  our server did let us know that we could just let her know how much to charge on each card and she would do it  we had so much patience for the entire thing because 3 of us are servers back home and can relate to busy day chaos  one of us went to thank her for the service and apologize for the madness when she expressed that she felt we were rude and she was busy so she couldnt really take the time to split the bill for us  welp    we were so rude that we even broke the entire check down for her with totals and names to match the card so she only had a total of 4 transactions to do instead of 10 all individuals only for her to come back and scold us for not being able to split up the check  oh and 18  gratuity was still added on to our bill just to spice things up a little more  definetly not worth the hassle for some over priced taco bell and a scolding and a math pop quiz  never coming back here  diablo can keep this hell hole to himself 
im a regular at the copperfield location so i came to this one while they were doing renovations  its much smaller than the copperfield location but its quaint   clean  the food is great   the service is friendly  definitely recommend 
rented a car here the week before christmas   check in was trouble free and the car ok  no problems   i was pleasantly surprised when i returned the car that it was actually cheaper than the contract price   the counter agent told me that he recalculated the price based on a daily rate rather than a weekly price and it was less than expected   im not sure why this didnt happen when i reserved the car on line but no complaints here  ive had problems with budget in the past so glad to finally find a decent rental company at the airport 
ive been here several times since this location opened and have also ordered take out  i have yet to be disappointed  delicious juicy burgers every time  fried pickles are good and im hooked on the bootlegger burger as well as the cajun sweet onion salad dressing  its my go to place when im in the mood for a burger 
needs to be worked on  thinking about getting another groupon for this place but im going to hold back on that  would i return back  maybe depending if its still there in a few months  this location has lots of business come and go because of no traffic  place is nice and clean  service is ok  but the food is not bad  but not great to where there is a signature dish  its like eating at a college cafe or mall food in a food court  its great if your hungry and even better with a groupon  paying regular price  well depends  there prices are reasonable   they have boba and other drinks  overall this place needs some improvement 
you get what you pay for  the food is actually great  its just the service that is associated with the casino name  terribles  staff is over worked and has attitude  the managers dont care and service is slow  but yet  others and i still come back because of the 2 for 1 offers  if you have patience  then this is the place  if you need eat and run  then go somewhere else  the menu and there specials are great  the only issue with this place is how it is run and managed  ask anyone who has eaten here and they say the food is good  but the service is questionable 
simply my favorite restaurant in las vegas and definitely on my top 3 list   bobby flay is amazing   i have been to mesa grill a handful of times  twice for brunch and three times for dinner  its awesome everytime  you need to like favor and a lil spicy because everything is very well spiced   here are some recommedations  brunch     the best thing on the brunch menu is their spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs   its goooie   mesa burger is tasty but nothing extraordinary  bloody marys are made just right with a little extra kick  dinner   so many excellent choices  red and black pepper encrusted filet mignon cooked perfectly  new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin the spiciest thing on the menu  pretty spicy but i couldnt stop eating it  yum   grilled lamb porterhouse chop best lamb chops ever and so perfect with cranberry  jalapeno sauce   dessert  they dont disappoint   we had the sampler and all of it was good   so if you get a chance to go there try it  its all worth it 
not a great show  same characters used it every scene  got be much better for the price  was expecting better
first time here and we will definitely be back  besides having really good burgers and onion rings our server ben was so friendly and personable which makes any great resturant even better  
went on easter  great service  great food  highly recommend the lobster carbonara     great food great service
love these ladies    they make the best coffee in town  i used to follow them at the different farmers markets  they are a total novelty 
this show is really fun and the acts are amazing   the variety of performances were very entertaining   i was truly amazed at the beautiful performers and the acrobatic skill  i laughed so hard i nearly cried     the soundtrack to the show was really well put together  i especially liked that they played songs by christina perri and tegan   sara    a bit about the show  even if you are not offended easily   you could be pushed a bit to the limit   i did not enjoy the fact that the show was geared so much towards the male audience and that only one of the male performers was really nice looking  as the majority of the female performers were exceptionally beautiful   the use of negative racial  humor was quite extensive     still this show is not to be missed 
ive been attending the yoga in the park event  almost every sunday during the summer  id come here for brunch right after the yoga practice with my cousin   this is such a convenient place for all day breakfast    what we didnt like was being surrounded by bees as we ate in the patio  you have to constantly battle them as you pour maple syrup on your pancake    we enjoyed the pancakes  thick and fluffy   the omelettes  probably my favourite  and the eggs benedict  3 stars for quality in my opinion  which means its neither super great  nor bad to get a low rating  the coffee is not strong at all  i usually have coffee at starbucks and the grenadier coffee definitely didnt deliver my daily dose of caffeine   the line ups are usually long  the prices are average and service is average 
i was attending a banquet hall event and needed an appointment at a trustworthy hair salon  so i did a bit of research online and found this place  which is quite close to my residence  i made an appointment a week in advance and they booked me right way  i received a confirmation voicemail a few days before my appointment  which was nice  i was greeted by the friendly staff when i arrived  i had a specific look on my mind and discussed it with martin  what he did with the styling was fantastic  he also offered me a glass of wine  while i enjoyed myself getting dolled up  i was very happy with the results and spent just under  60 for the shampoo and style   tip  the parking is located at the back of the building 
not sure what the fuss is about on the caesars salad here  guys  its the same salad you get at any restaurant  they just blend the ingredients in front of you  honestly  it didnt taste as good as some of the people claim  i loved the seafood tower as appetizer  the portions of the steaks are perfect and i adored the fries  this place is ridiculously expensive though 
i bought the groupon and thought id give this place a shot  thinking im getting a sweet deal  when you pay  10 for tax  for a less than an optimal facial  you know youve been ripped   this spa is a tiny room upstairs with very bad air conditioning  of course when you enter the place you see comfy and colourful sofas and lots of european products  and pictures of people who are supposedly famous  but as soon as you go upstairs to get the facial  youre confronted with a whole new scene  i remember going somewhere in the villages of a third world country to get my eyebrows done and this place reminded me exactly of it    salisa loves to talk and brag about her skills  but honestly the threading i had was one of the most painful ones and i never have pain during eyebrow threadings  the facial was was too short  and i think i spent half an hour just listening to salisas stories rather than enjoying myself  she also had to answer a customer downstairs in the middle of the facial  cause theres no secretary  not professional at all    my skin felt clean after this experience  but there was not enough extraction of blackheads in my opinion and the mask didnt do much  next time ill go somewhere with higher standards 
tiny place downstairs with very intimate seating  most customers come here by themselves after work  myself included  i had no idea what to order  but i knew i wanted some soup  the host suggested a combo that comes with soup  spring rolls and a main dish consisting of rice  vegetables and shrimps  the soup gets 5 stars  i had too much food after that  the spring rolls are crunchy and flavourful  the lemongrass shrimp has a very subtle taste to it  so not strong at all  which is great  loved the jasmine tea as it was very new for me  the food kept coming very fast and the level of attentiveness was excellent 
im a big fan of desert and ice cream  they let us sample the 12 froyo flavours  but i wasnt too impressed with them  except for the chocolate flavour  which is also their most popular flavour  theyre probably more healthy than regular ice cream though  the crepe with nutella on the other hand  was 5  5  everything is priced by weight  including the crepe toppings  great service  free wifi  caffeinated drinks and comfortable seats 
i came here without a previous appointment  but i was welcomed in on a saturday afternoon  the prices are reasonable  i paid  30 for wash and styling for my long hair  the whole process was quick and hassle free  jina is honest about what can and cannot be done with certain hair types  so disappointments will be kept to a minimum  unlike many other hair salons ive gone to before  i was not coerced to buy any particular products for my hair  they only take debit and cash 
good quality drinks  with terrible customer service  the girl working here didnt offer to ask what we want to order despite not having other customers around  she made zero effort in communication other than telling us the price and gave us stained steel spoons  solution  plastic spoons
lets start with what i like about this place  their variety of shisha flavour and their decor  i got adventurous and tried the rum flavour shisha  it was super sweet  so  i suggest not getting it and instead go for mint or double apple  this place can get quite busy on a weekend night  we had to sit on the table until one of the bed like booths got empty  the food is alright and the prices are high  my boyfriend and i ended up spending over  60 for shisha and food here  but of course we were hungry  the staff is friendly and the service alright 
i was participating in the yoga in the park activity and my cousin suggested we walk around and enjoy ourselves  the park is absolutely amazing looking  theres a pond  hills for hiking and a maple leaf square with beautiful red flowers where the yoga class was held  we saw the restaurant on our way back and decided to take advantage of the all day breakfast  the food was pretty good and so was the coffee  a tip that id like to mention is when ordering pancakes  we had the option of adding  strawberries  for  2  what we got was strawberry jam  not the fresh fruit  the only trivial disappointment of the day  otherwise  i strongly recommend both the park and the restaurant  apparently its beautiful regardless of the season 
i checked out this place for the first time and i liked it a lot  theres a parking lot right at the door  so if you come early youre guaranteed a spot  the receptionist is a gregarious girl who loves to joke around  when you enter  you hang your coat take off your shoes  give your car keys to the receptionist in exchange for a key to the locker and walk to the change room  the change room is spacious and there are about 6 showers if i counted right  each shower has a bottle of shower gel  which you can also use as shampoo as the direction says  each of the 3 basins also has a uniquely scented anti bacterial soap theres a towel by the basins  i just wish there were more towels to use  because i dont think anybody wants used towels to dry their hands with    the hot yoga room is warm enough to make you completely sweaty by the end of the moksha practice  the instructor doesnt actually do the yoga  he just talks and walks around to adjust everyone  so  if its your first time you have to look at others to follow  there were mainly young people at this studio and about 80  were girls in all shapes and sizes  you can definitely tell whos more advanced and whos not  i think i was amongst the intermediate who could hold most  if not all of the poses  the room has a dimmed light  but its enough to see the pipes on the ceiling when you look up  i couldnt help but to think how great it would be if the ceiling was covered    also  make sure you bring slippers when you walk out the hot room  because the floor can be very slippery when everyone walks around with their sweaty feet 
this review will be very brief  food  excellent drinks  excellent dessert  more than excellent  service  very good dont take offence if your date stares at the waitresss bum when they think youre not aware  its a very natural male reaction to women wearing short skirts  which is how they do it at moxies 
this restaurant is located downstairs and is kind of hidden  the restaurant is very dark and the white guy at the cash is not exactly the friendliest person around  the middle eastern guy taking orders is absolutely charming though  he is polite and caters to you  i dont understand why everyone keeps bragging about how great this place is  cmon guys  its just another shawarma place  the food items are exactly like any other middle eastern restaurant you go to  i think the relatively low prices is what attracts everyone  ok  i give them 3 5 stars for the food  its not amazing but its plenty and it taste alright 
i avoided this place forever because i was judgy about the house  but it had the best reviews and price for a place that close to me  i was a long time aniu fan but moved too far away to get there consistently  midtown traffic amirite   note the entrance is in the back  i entered in the front and felt silly wandering through the floor but every one chuckled with me and it was a wonderful start to an awesome visit  kaitlyn cuts and colors my hair  she can interpret my half meanings about my hair perfectly  i dont want to look oooooold  i dont want alien head  i want to look fun but not too crazy    the atmosphere is modern and clean  everyone is welcoming and nice  im so glad that i  literally  stumbled through the front door 
im from cebu and i know what real cebu lechon baboy taste like  flavour is there but  it needs more salt and more cebu flavour  the lechon skin is not crispy anymore  nevertheless  its better than any lechon i have tasted in toronto  lechon manok is a different story  like the other reviews  it is delish and taste like back home  we ordered 1 pound lechon   15 99   1 kawali   9 99   1 lechon manok   12 99   1 bbq pork skewer   2 99  and 3 rice   4 50  and 3 clear soup  free   i paid  56 including tax and tip  not much vegetable option   would love if they sell fresh lumpia to compliment their food  hint hint   will i come back  maybe once a year of cholesterol overload is good enough  staff were  friendly and accommodating   if management is reading this  plesse seasoned the lechon baboy with more salt 
mmmm  raspberry collider    5 is a little pricey for 20 oz drink  but worth the occasional treat   friendly staff  clean store   and quick service 
amazing food  tasty cocktails  good service    they have happy hour every day  even weekends  i was able to use my living social deal during happy hour  unlike fuego cityscape   my husband loved the beer selection and i liked their creative cocktails  not the strongest  but still tasty   the place wasnt too busy  definitely a neighborhood sports bar feel  but with better food   i will definitely be going back 
my sister introduced me here since its in here hood   theyre gluten free  helpful and very friendly   i tried several of their pastries and they were all tasty and excellent   i couldnt tell they were gluten free either and trust me  ive eaten tons of gluten free sweets over the years   unfortunately for me  i wish it wasnt out of the way for me  but id definitely go back   cute ambience too 
i had been dying to give this place a try   our plan was to try a few of yelps best reviewed places along dundas which consisted of an early dinner at santouka  followed by bubble tea at chatime   our group consisted of 4 people today and we arrived at santouka at about 5 30 hoping and praying there would not be a line so early in the evening   when we arrived  the restaurant was full and we were the second group in line so i guess we could be considered lucky   we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving and promptly greeted by our waitress   she recommended the shio and shoyu ramen so we went with 2 of each  one being a sake combo  which included a small bowl of salmon on rice   we also ordered the gyoza   which werent very impressive   they werent bad  just not great   ramen arrived shortly and the presentation was fairly impressive   shio ramen was very tasty  not too salty at all even though we went with the regular saltiness   shoyu was good as well though being flavoured with soy sauce was a bit saltier than the shio   the bowls are definitely not the largest weve ever seen but was quite filling and the broth quite rich   overall a very good dining experience and similar to the ramen we had in kyoto   prices are definitely a bit higher than some of the other places in toronto but imho worth the added cost 
i came here for weekend brunch recently and had terrible service  this is probably the reason why it was a much slower saturday morning for them than my last experience here    first of all  let me say that this is not the first time ive come to origin for lunch  the portions are small for brunch and quite pricey compared to many other brunch places in downtown toronto  despite this ive enjoyed the food in the past and even recommended it to my friends this weekend which i deeply regretted    upon finishing our meal  the restaurant was not full and nobody was waiting  we did not ask for the bill and the bill was brought to us with the intent to kick us out  we continued to chat as no one was waiting for the table and the waiter subsequently returned and made a point to ask us if we needed the check holders that he had left at our table to make it clear that they wanted us to leave  normally the waiter collect the check holders after patrons finish paying or he couldve just collected them from us quietly and said that he needed it and left us our receipts  clearly this was a tactic to kick us out  usually  if i see a restaurant is busy and there is wait  i know to settle my bill quickly and leave  as this was not the case i was very disappointed especially given the preset tip of 20  on the machine that they expect  had i known he was subsequently going to come back and ask collect our check holders in such a rude fashion  i would not have tipped at all  its not like we got much service throughout  after the waiter had asked us what we wanted to order in the beginning  he never came back and we had to flag him down after to take our order   i always get the french toast   duck confit  it was good usual but unfortunately not good enough for me to come here ever again 
the steak  filet mignon was good  the marinade over powering it though  carrots were way over pan fried  bread basket was amazing  drinks not too bad  fantastic service  overall  a decent eating option 
this is an awesome brewery  restaurant  5 of us enjoyed 5 different flights and the waitress was more than helpful with our bad french and multiple orders  she suggested some different beers from the list based on what we were looking for  she also suggested a few appetizers to compliment the beer  the jerky was delicious        but the beer  there are some fun  creatvive ones  aged in chianti barrels  aged in tequila barrels and so on  very cool stuff 
love this place  staff knows me by name after only been there a handful of times  makes me feel welcome  staff is always super helpful and suggests something new every time  one of the cleanest firehouses that ive been too  yum 
ive been here a few times and each time  ive had cold fries  and a grilled cheese that looked like it had oily cheap cheese from a packet    grilled cheeses never really look like they touch a griddle for more than a few seconds    service is always good   ill definitely go back but may order my grilled cheese a little toastier 
great place for breakfast  awesome combinations  friendly fast service  omelet was super good and so were the pancakes   we will be back for sure 
my husband and i love eating at the bar for dinner  frashers always great food and the atmosphere is very inviting and relaxing  the chicken   rib combo along with all of their sides are amazing   we always have a fun time at frashers  oh and get the butter cake 
 2 per plate for sushi  great way to try lots of different types  loved this place and will be back soon 
been taking my two sons  age 2 and 4  here for about a year and its the best indoor play place that weve found in town  jon is great with the kids  everything is padded and carpeted so you dont have to worry about falls  and there is a good mix of open play time and structured classes  also  we had our sons birthday party here and it was an awesome experience  i would highly recommend birthdays here  we have sent numerous friends here and havent heard a single complaint  highly recommend 
felt kind of discriminated  i went in on a monday  november 20th at 9 00 a m   opening time   asked for a price had to think about it  not even three minutes passed when the boss of the two ladies that were there looked at me through the cameras  called  and told them to tell me they were going to be too busy  i was about to say ok to get it over with because i needed my hair done asap as i was joining an honor society in college  it was 9 00 a m  in the morning and not one client was there  what kind of great clips doesnt accept the first person there and then look at you through the cameras call and practically say not   i woke up early that day just to be the first one at that great clips and then i get told no  rude and unprofessional if you ask me  however  i still kept quiet and professional and cant wait to own businesses to show just how to treat paying clientele  the two ladies there were really nice though even though it might not be a nice feeling to be under strict supervision at all times  that is all i have to say 
fast  affordable  and did good work   i only had a pair of jeans hemmed  but the staff was super nice and it was cheap   13    they were quick to get me measured and back on my way   i came here after calling several other places in the area and either getting poor customer service 
i was fortunate to have come across this family owned pizza joint after finding it on groupon  both the pizza and wings were fresh and exceeded my expectations  im looking forward to going back 
decent dry cleaner  but overpriced  they do have a next day option  which is nice  if youre willing to wait an additional day  the competition in the area is significantly cheaper  almost 40 50  cheaper   i would recommend this dry cleaner if you need an article or two cleaned overnight  but thats it  due to the astronomical prices 
a great first experience  we were greeted and assisted by the owner of the business  she was so sweet and very professional  i will definitely come back and would recommend this to anyone who wants a true bra fitting  also i was very impressed by how transgender friendly this business is  there was a customer who was in the process of transitioning in for her first bra fitting and the owner was absolutely fantastic with her 
this place just opened in the southwest area lv  im super excited  the girl at the register helped me with the taste testing of every juice they sell  some were amazing and some were ok  it depends on your choice of taste  she was very knowledgable on all the drinks  the juices break down to whats in it and what it is good for  they have certain memberships if your interested but i was just there for a bottle or two  i choose the  abundant  and the  royal   11 a drink  one nutty and one fruity  i suggest you taste test before purchasing  it helps a lot more  the bottles are glass and if you bring back the glasses you save  1 on your next purchase  how sweet is that  ill be back to purchase more drinks  they are kinda pricey but think of each drink as a healthy meal replacement      3  26  14  a couple days later and i am back to try their juice cleanse  a one day juice cleanse package is  60  it includes 8 12oz bottles to drink for the full day  3 whealthy  2 love  1 pure  1 energized  and 1 magnificent  kinda like dessert for the night   me and my boyfriend decided to do it together to see how it feels  they number the bottles for you to know exactly what you need to drink every 1 1  2  2 hours  im pretty excited  a one day cleanse every two weeks or every month would not hurt  i would do this once a week if i could afford it  haha thank you jamie for your help    
it be jamming and cant wait til they get alcohol and food there itll be a turnt up bar
horrible customer service  as a young adult i felt that i was ignored by staff  a employee in greeting range  allowed me to go unassisted the entire time i was there  this is disappointing to me 
we reserved a luxury strip view room  and a couple days later i called to make sure we can get a smoking room becuz we r smokers  they said they reserved us a smoking room  then after waiting in a 45 minute line  on a sunday  no less  to finally check in  they said we didnt reserve a smoking room and no smoking rooms are available  i said  so u guys cant guarantee smoking or non smoking rooms   and she said no  we cant  sooooo now we r stuck with a room we dont want  i suggest u dont stay here when in vegas cuz they cant guarantee if u have have a smoking or nonsmoking room   how horrible is that  what if u have kids and r stuck in a room that smells like smoke  just bad bad bad  very disappointed 
last night we decided to make the long streetcar journey to leslieville to give this joint a try after reading some positive reviews  i called in an order for a large take out pepperoni about 20 minutes out from the restaurant  kicked back  and enjoyed all of the interesting sights that one sees traveling east on queen on the ttc    the staff greeted me when i entered the restaurant  and had my pizza ready to go immediately  because they knew my name from the order  they used it throughout the transaction  the personal touch was great  the interior is on the smaller side  but definitely enough seating for anyone wanting to dine in on a wednesday night  i  however  strongly suggest bringing a blanket and taking your pizza to the park next door to eat while the weather is still nice     i cant describe in words how good this pizza is  the crust is so oily and crunchy  and the tomato sauce is the most perfect blend  topped off with crispy pepperoni and mounds of cheese  im drooling right now thinking about it    we ended our night at the underground comedy club down the street to catch an open mic  i highly suggest this exact scenario as a date option 
milestones is always a place where you can bring different groups of ppl to especially with work functions  staff are always great in keeping the food and experience smooth and timely  food while they have change the menu recently some of the old favourites are still around     always a pleasure to eat at milestones 
the only reason im writing this is because im super confused  do cashiers normally talk on their phone while checking out customers  susan just completely stopped me from helping her putting my groceries on the check out so she could pick up her phone and have a conversation and then proceeded to check me out after she was finished  lol im sorry did i inturrupt something  most definitely will never come here again  holy rude 
i love this place  i probably went there around 20 times so far  its a great spot for first dates  p their happy hour is great and its definitely my first pick for sushi in phoenix  service is super friendly as well 
after 2 phone calls and 3 emails  ive yet to actually speak to an attorney  unless you are a big shoot client dont bother with this group as they wont give you the time of day 
totally surprised by the food  really good for a pub  tavern  bar  really nice bartenders  a lot of tvs 
no more liver n onions but the ahi is dynamite  oysters sweet  big n delicious  dont forget the martini
loved the service and bartenders     fantastic seafood dinner and the whiskey selection is dynamite
fantastic sliders  my daughter loved it  the twins are cool and friendly    
the hostess was really friendly and helpful   explained the courses meals and how it works   the quality of the food was fresh  tasteful  and good portion  this is one of the few japanese restaurants actually own by the japanese  so the quality of the food is there  it is actually one of the best value in town    if the owner   the chef put their names as the restaurant  you know they put the heart   soul in there    as a customer  we appreciated and enjoyed mr takashi kurosawa provided an excellent restaurant and destination where we are looking forward to come here every time in vegas 
this hotels room was ok  however  the bed sheets were extremely unclean  there was clipped toenails and hair inside our bed  we called housekeeping for a change and we had to wait over 40 minutes for the change and we were given attitude from housekeeping staff  extremely unsatisfied and will never come back 
delicious and a pretty healthy choice when going out to eat   oh and the baklava    amazing 
i have bought two cars from there now  the first car was an escape that i traded in for my tahoe  they really worked with me my credit was bad and a first time buyer so they worked with me to get into the escape at a reasonable price one can expect for a first time buyer  eight months later they worked with me to get the vehicle i truly wanted  each time has been a pleasure working with jason and they always helped with my service concerns and buying the warranty  they dont give you the typical use car dealership feel where they pressure you into anything they can but truly listen to what you want 
the food was good  there happy hour is pretty good  they forgot about our food but then they were quick to get it out
came here for my anniversary dinner based upon a friends recommendation   food here is awesome  the sea bass skewers  the tuna tiradito  the chefs sushi  sashimi  the seafood is fresh and service is pretty quick   the only thing that caught me off guard was the atmosphere  it was pretty hip  club scene like  the restaurant were filled with big groups on their bachelor  bachelorette parties  the place even have their own house dj    so overall  very good for food  very good for groups  party goers    not good for a romantic dinner 
everyone here were so attentive and helpful when needed to be  when people are shopping  they usually like to do it without an associate following their every move  this place gave me my space to shop around for almost an hour while still giving me the attention that i needed from time to time  it was a smaller store but the way it was arranged made it spacious  theyre product selection were also the same as it would be in a bigger store so i didnt feel like i was missing out on other scents 
gorgeous room  we stayed in the family room as well  it was a beautiful room and in a great location  the breakfast was nice and the staff was kind and helpful  the full english was very very tast
best pho spot off the strip in vegas  kinda ghetto but hey if you eat pho at a spot thats not ghetto youre not eating legit pho my friend  pho tai is the go to meal along with egg rolls and spring rolls  great for a pick me up after a long night of drinking and debauchery in vegas 
stayed here for a few days while celebrating my birthday with a friend   we enjoyed our stay at the signature very much but we were not blown away as we were at the venetian and the wynn    while the signature is much better place to stay than the mgm grand that has become rundown   i wouldnt put it in the top 2 of places ive stayed so far in vegas  maybe in the top 4   heres the good and the bad    we stayed in the one bedroom suite which was like a mini one bedroom with great functionality   flat screen tvs in the living room and the bedroom   i wished the tv in the living room could rotate facing the kitchen so i could watch while cooking breakfast and dinner   full kitchen with microwave  4  burner stove top  oven  full refrigerator  it look a long time to check in as they seemed to not be fully staffed to accomodate the line   we often had to wait for valet to bring our car down because only one person was on staff   our bags sat out front for at least 15 minutes because there was only one bell boy on staff  richard  the valet  actually brought our bags up and  was awesome and had a great attitude   the dishwasher was difficult to start because it wasnt properly installed    we requested housekeeping before heading downstairs to work out in the gym   we were told they would send someone right up but when we returned from our 1 hour workout  we had to call again because they didnt follow through   all in all the signature staff was very friendly  our stay was very comfortable and more than anything  we will enjoy the memories we made in suite  29601 for years to come     
the tour starts with a cheesy barrel ride through a whisky distillery process  afterwards your tour guide guides through the differences in whiskies from the various regions of scotland  this is followed by a sampling of a whisky from your chosen region  the tasting guide  charolette  was informative and made a whisky novice like myself comfortable with the 5 steps to appreciate whisky  the tour is complete with a complementary glencairn glass 
ive been to a lot of japanese restaurants but this one is one of the best japanese restaurant in toronto  they gave us free soup with noodles and japanese salad while waiting for our food  my sister ordered volcano roll which is their one of the best sushi  their food presentation is very nice  i ordered unagi don  i was surprised with the amount of unagi they put  some restaurants dont put alot of unagi  my husband ordered chicken teriyaki lunch special  it is very presentable but the amount of chicken is not alot maybe because its their lunch special but taste really good  for dessert  we tried their black sesame ice cream  again  were surprised that they gave us 3 scoops of ice cream  coz some other resto gives only 1 scoop  overall  we were very satisfied with the amount of food  presentation  and price  for sure we will come back and eat here again 
upon walking into your establishment  on park rd 11 25 17 at 12 00  no one greeted us for at least 2 minutes  when we were finally  greeted  we were asked  what do you want  ummm to sit for lunch     this is when we were to just go ahead so we picked our own table and the person who  greeted  us was apparently our server who didnt even know the drink menu  asked me to pass the table tent to her so she could read it  she had to flip through the pages to get to saturdays drink menu and proceeded to read it to us  when we finally ordered we wanted a 14  half cheese half chicken parmesan and the  server  obliged  after waiting a long time for this pizza  keep in mind  we were one of the only customers in the place minus the two people at the bar   our  server   whos name is jennifer  brought us over an enormous pizza  i quickly say wow thats a huge pizza  thats the 14    she said no thats the 18   the chicken parm only comes in that size  i said well if i had known that  we would not had ordered it  she never specified this to us so when she walked away  i went to look at the menu and noticed you can get this pizza in any size  i hear a shout from across of the restaurant asking what i wanted  i quickly said  a manager  and sat back down  our  server  jennifer came back and rudely said  the manager is taking care of it  where i replied  i still wanted to speak to them  after waiting forever  we ask another person for a to go box and they basically threw it down on our table  a manager never showed up and i promise you that i will never return to your establishment ever again and i have no problem letting more people know about this 
well  sr is one of those restaurants where i dont mind going to meet up  with my friends to catch up over some food    i guess what im trying to say is that the food  isnt too bad   price is reasonable and the ambience is hip enough to please everyone  so  if you are just looking for a place to eat and hang  sr might work for you    i always order the tornado rolls  house pad thai and one new dish each time i visit   if you are very reserved  they have a great on line menu to give you an idea of their food     it can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner so make reservations for large parties 
id like to give them 3 5 stars but yelp wont let me  so i will err on the side of caution and go with three    the ambiance is very quiet and laid back  not as comfortable as other taprooms ive been to  due to the small and cramped area  but its functional  at least   the offerings are extensive   from pales to ipas to lagers to stouts and some lesser seen offerings compared to other places   quality of the offerings was truly top notch   the ipa i had  i cant remember the name  was quite possibly the smoothest  hoppy but smooth  very special    the bartenders we nice and efficient  if not overly friendly  though they were very patient with our questions  so i will give them that    again  the brewery offers great beer at an unfortunately cramped location with really poor parking options  if they could expand and get to a spot with better parking options it would really help their brand 
this is my go to   lee is the best  she has great style on how to do my nails  i always get compliments on how nice my nails look  the pedicures are also amazing  they have upgraded massage chairs that are so comfortable  i have made great friends with the staff over the years  my happy place   
i placed an online order last night  the owner called me this morning to ask for my credit card information over the phone  because the system didnt capture it  i said that i dont provide that kind of information over the phone in response to someone calling me  it could be a phishing scam  she said that the system wouldnt show her all of my secure information  which in my mind is exactly the way it should be  she said that she could not process the order without me giving her all of my credit card information over the phone  in which case  why use the website at all  thats a busted website  i then proceeded to tell her a million other things that are wrong with website  its not even worth my time to go into here  the point is that if you are ordering more than one bouquet to go to a single address  the website is obnoxiously tedious  i used the word  sucks   she kept interrupting me and didnt want to hear any criticism of her website  but when i used the word  sucks   she got really angry and said that she refused to process this order or any future orders from me ever  there was no point in continuing the conversation  so i hung up  she called me back and was angry that i had hung up on her  i hung up on her again  in this day and age  ordering flowers should not be this hard or involve this much hostility 
i   was there this past saturday with 6 other people  we sat very comfortably  the restaurant holds approx 30 people so i recommend reservations  especially for friday or saturday night    they offer a truly complete dinner menu from start to finish for under  30 which includes great hungarian   gypsy style entertainment   you will not leave hungry   you  can bring your own wine or beer  which is another plus   the atmosphere is very homey and friendly family style   the owners are the chefs  servers and musicians  so they are very eager to please their guests    the menu is hungarian and eastern european   i highly recommend this restaurant     and the  menu is even less expensive every other evening of the week 
just had lunch here with an old friend  i had not been here in several years   i was extremely disappointed with the quality and the value   i ordered a lunch special  the toasted pasta came with half a bowl of soup and a coffee   the tomato soup was ok although it was not hot  the portion was very small   the pasta was below average  the potion was ok but it was in a bath of sauce and 1 hour later my stomach is still complaining   it did not have a specific taste   it was just very plain with a lot of sauce   my friend ordered the tuna  which was not properly cooked  the inside was not cooked at all and he hardly ate any of it   we also ordered 2 draught beers which we had to return because they were flat  the waiter was very pleasant and polite and replaced them for us but the next two beers were just as bad   not impressed  i wish the owners good luck  but they need a major change in the kitchen and they need to step up their game  all this cost approx  70 tax and tip included  a very expensive lunch for a very mediocre experience 
very casual steakhouse  the place is good for family or group gathering  service is great  but the food is okay  not great 
stan wang and staff provide outstanding customer service   my husband and i first worked with the advantage mortgage group 17 years ago on the purchase of a home in phoenix  we relocated to the dallas area shortly thereafter  but kept in contact with stan through his annual newsletter   once we found ourselves relocating back to phoenix  stan was one of the first people we called   he knows the mortgage business better than anyone out there  and keeps you informed through the tortuous process of qualifying for a loan these days   stan goes above and beyond to make the process a little less tortuous   we highly recommend the advantage mortgage group 
i have been a patient of dr  reed for over a year now  when i first came to see dr reed i was suffering from migranes on a daily and was tired of the pain and poping of pills that gave me no relief  dr  reed started me an a therapy plan and now i no longer suffer from these daily migranes  i get them every once in a while and can say i have noticed a great improvement  thank you dr  reed for taking care of me and taking the time to listen to my concerns  dr  reed and his office makes all his patients feel welcome and gives everyone that extra care that patients need  if your looking for a great chiropractor look no further  i highly recommend 
i really enjoy this place  ive been twice so far and plan on going back in a few weeks  its nice and quiet   very clean and the staff is professional  the memberships are silly  but its a business   overall i love the atmosphere 
this review is only for delivery service  i ordered from here a few times  my pizza arrived hot and just as i ordered  i dont think the pepperoni lovers has enough pepperoni on it   compared to other locations   but it still tasted delicious  i took off one star for this    my favorite is the pan crust  but stuffed crust is a close second  love the  5 special  as it makes the pizza more  affordable   i find the pizza quite pricey normally and the pies seem to be shrinking in size  but man  is it ever good   
i thought the rooms were fine  just a typical las vegas hotel room    until     i woke up covered in bug bites  on the first night my girlfriend woke up in her bed with what looked like flea bites  i made fun of her saying her dog at home was dirty  then the second night     i became covered in red itchy bumps all over  i have sensitive skin so the bug bites ended up giving me a rash as well  all over my chest  head and body  it was disgusting    both of us  in two different beds  were covered in bug bites  fleas  bed bugs  i dont know but i will not be coming back here   i didnt bother to complain to the hotel because the room was comped any ways but it was disgusting nonethless   x
favorite sushi place as of now  this used to be my spot years ago and i stopped going because i moved to peoria and it was a 20 minute drive  i absolutely love the vibe and variety  its a trendy  loud  and sexy kind of vibe  the location is also perfect because after you grab a bite you can go shop  play games  or watch a movie  kabuki has unique appetizers and a huge variety of fresh sake  my favorite roll is the dynamite roll  be careful when ordering this though  they also have a dynamite appetizer that doesnt have the actual california roll in it  the server accidentally brought the appetizer one out  not a problem though when i let her know she kindly brought the correct one  kabuki also has a points club  for each dollar you spend you get one point  when you get 500 points you receive a  25 credit  pretty neat  if youre looking for some fresh sushi and a cool spot to hang this is your spot  unsure on if they have a happy hour  will update when i know 
i wont say i love this location  2 stars because it does the job and has a variety of equipment  ive been a la fitness member for 10  years now  ive been to probably 15 of the clubs  favorite being the union hills location  this one is located in a good area in ahwatukee  so its nice right  no  for the past year i had both a la and life time membership  ive been attending life time so maybe im a bit spoiled    i am starting to go here again because im saving 20 minutes of driving each gym trip and  68  mo  still questioning if its worth it though  although there is a large variety of equipment it just seems outdated and crusty  it does the job dont get be wrong  most of what i need is here  what is a bit annoying is they put all of the good  newer stuff in the training area  i dont need a personal trainer but i do need a medicine ball  also  the locker rooms are disgusting  and they smell  i would never shower in them with the amount of hair and dirt i saw when glancing  the level of customer service is at an all time low  the front desk girl sits on her phone texting and doesnt even look up when you leave  when you are walking in  she grabs your key fob and doesnt smile or anything  possibly because i go between 4 00am 5 30am  there are no managers  overall  this is not the best gym  however  if it is very close to you it is a good bet  good price and a good amount of equipment  also  some of the cardio equipment have tvs  if you like to watch to prevent boredom 
the only reason i visited this restaurant was simply because bobby flay owns it  i watch him every day in the food network so i was so curious of his food and i finally had a chance  my husband ordered new york strip steak with plantain tamale with molasses butter and i ordered new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and it was amazing    what made our experience the best was that bobby flay was working in the kitchen making sure every dishes that were going out with perfection      we had a chance to speak and take photos with him  he looked tired but he was very kind and humble  he took his time to thank all the fans who visited his restaurant despite of the busy kitchen  we will definitely visit this restaurant again 
the good  absolutely friendly staff that are well informed too  the shisha was not bad either  personally my favourite was the watermelon mint  while not overpowering at all  the shisha felt clean and well maintained and did not taste anything other than what i paid for  i also love how long and roomy the couches are  they provide enough room to truly relax and enjoy the shisha   the bad  not sure if it was just me  but personally i felt that the food was lacking  they do not have much variety of anything to eat  mostly deserts   the ugly  while the couches are pretty roomy they are not the most comfortable  some spots smell a bit      overall experience  defiantly one of the better shisha lounges  in montreal if not the best  would definitely recommend going here for any occasion 
i have been coming here for over a decade  it was my goto place when i didnt feel well  hurt my back or rolled a quad  during time with my quads i was in so much i should have had a speed pass    today was my last visit  i was the first customer of the day   the young man up front was nice and got me from the parking lot with a wheel chair  as i couldnt walk from the tremendously hurting ankle  he was 5 star nice    the x ray tech marie was nice and careful with the wheel chair  took her time taking me for x rays and made sure to back into rooms to avoid hitting my foot  thx marie   she also took care to deliver me back to my vehicle    now the reason for the score  dr tracey   i have broken nearly every bone in my body over the years and this ankle hurt as bad as any of those   i couldnt stop my eyes from tearing up from the pain   dr tracey said she had a prescription that would ease the pain and eliminate swelling  even though i had no swelling  and another that would help with sleep because the pain was so bad i couldnt sleep    i trusted her to give me something that would work but was concerned because in all the years i had been coming there no one had ever prescribed this before   two and a half hours later i get the prescriptions filled and take them    i laid down with ice and 5 hours later still in crazy pain  i look up the pill and it just an anti inflammatory medicine  not for pain  i called back to the urgent care to ask if we could get something that would work prescribed because this isnt right or working    dr tracey refused  she said thats what you get  she would not reconsider  so now 7 hours later im left to go to the emergency room and see some one that will lesson to the patient and care if a medicine is working    i later shared my experience with my wife and we discovered her reasons for not returning were the same as mine  dr tracey    save your money  its not worth the visit to dr tracey    good bye warner urgent care 
have a great time here  food is da bomb  and this karaoke guy spencer is crazy badass cool    great times    
just loved it  it was busy but there is a reason  5 stars period  got the rueben burger and the apple brie burger  both amazing  fresh made chips and the pretzel appetizer was fantastic 
this place is good   i was concerned at first because i am used to iranian style kabobs  i would have preferred a larger piece of pita bread but thats it    no other complaints   if thats my only complaint for a kabob place then the place is good 
i came here w   a group of people and we got seats at the patio so we saw the wanna be pussycat dolls pirate show   the service and food was great   if you still have room for dessert    order the donut balls in a bag   im not sure what its called but its super yummy 
this is my favorite sushi place  i always leave feeling like i had a great time and looking forward to coming back  recently had the lobster miso soup which had a huge lobster claw in it and looked very impressive which was fun for my daughter  it gets pretty busy and is not a huge place so i recommend calling ahead 
good  i wouldnt say the best place but its definitely solid  pretty pricey though  i may be forced to go somewhere else based on price alone        update  the last few orders have been pretty bad  their chow mein is inconsistent  last order had way too much sauce and drowned everything else  general taos was a tiny portion  they are stingy on the rice and the kung pao was terrible  no flavor  spent almost  50 on sub par food and didnt even have left overs  time to find a new place 
im not an indian food fanatic but wow  this was delicious  yes it was all vegetarian but i didnt miss meat one bit  i went for the lunch special and had two plates of god knows what  everything was fantastic  there was one type of bread called dosa  i think  with mashed potatoes in the middle and wow  amazing  i think my italian husband may even like this place  lol
great hike  now im not a hiker and i think that sh t is crazy but i do enjoy the view at the top  im in good shape and healthy and i found it quite challenging  it starts off pretty decent then towards the top you start scaling rocks  its a pretty steep incline  you are set holding on for dear life and making sure your footing is right  at one point you at on these narrow rocks and there is a cliff to your right and left  its scary  not going to lie  i wanted to turn back but i continued  it was worth it  would i do it again  maybe   
after read many low rates of orient kitchen located in 4808 baum blvd  pittsburgh pa 15213 kind of feel sorry for  the restaurant  the owner should review of their yelp to improve in good attitude improve their honest cooking of daily fresh foods to bring the restaurant lively  instead had his son in the picture to upgrades the business  there is no customer to give them the opportunity to take good pictures to get the good impression of orient kitchen restaurant  where are the value customers   none  once bitten twice shy will not return  but for only those not look up in yelp just walk in and hope the owner take this opportunity to keep up with changes have return walk in customers  hope for the best learn their mistakes and valve the customers to serve healthy and greater foods 
amazing place   totally will come back again  recommend everyone to try it  costumer service was really good  we order the bisque seeped and chorizo torte  both very delicios 
great pizza   pasta is just ok  but the quality of the pizza definitely made up for the pasta shortfall   sitting out on the patio on a beautiful afternoon with a very reasonably priced pitcher of belle gueule was fantastic   service was spot on as well   highly recommend making a reservation in advance for lunch  though   also  i would definitely recommend this place for kids 
nice food   spot on preparation   really bad choice to bring kids   drink prices are very steep for what you get   recommend the clam special   finally  the inside was blazing hot   numerous people were complaining and sweating 
this company has great customer service   the technicians are very experienced and professional   they will make sure your appliance gets fixed at a reasonable price 
my family and i have been going to dinner almost weekly at this restaurant for at least 8 months  tonight we went there with our neighbors and i dont think i have had this poor of service pretty much ever    we got there around 7 and it was not too crowded  got a table right away  we had our sushi order filled out and it took at least 10 minutes for our server to take it    she came over and said that there had been a mix up with someone elses to go order and she personally had to handle it  then  we had ordered appetizers  one of which was edamame  it took closer to a half hour to get these  one of our party got all his sushi at once and three of us basically watched him finish his meal before one more small roll arrived  got our main roll maybe 15 minutes after that  while we were waiting a large party came in and was on the patio and from that point on  our server was non existent and started giving us excuses about how she personally had to handle this group  seriously   they were  according to their shirts  a group of sober bikers and they were so quiet in the patio we couldnt even hear them and we were sitting by the door  the staff was running out there frequently with drinks and sushi and we couldnt even get a drink refill  apparently the bikers were not getting great service despite this because we watched one of their party come in and procure a stack of chopsticks  forks and plates and take them to the group    my neighbor waited at least a solid hour for her roll and all this time i was waiting for one order of nigiri sushi  they brought me a sashimi but thats not what i ordered  i asked about three times about it and after about 20 minutes i told my husband to forget it and just get the check  the server came over and told us she had already taken it off the bill  so basically they decided i was not going to get the sushi i had ordered almost two hours before  obviously if youre a large group  you get preference over loyal customers who have been there longer and have waited a ridiculous amount of time for their food   i had to step outside because the anxiety of this experience was starting to get to me  when the rest of my group got to the car they informed me that the comment card in the bill came pre filled out with a positive review  the only positive thing i can say is we positively dont want to go back 
now heres a contractor that lives up to what they say they will do at a reasonable price  mike d and sean where absolutely awesome  these guys were professional and prompt  sean was here at the crack of dawn and working  i couldnt ask for better  if i were still in business these are the kind of employees we look for  stunning work  no over sprays and everything was left clean 
bought march 26 17  noticed stitching came loose on front foot pad on the side by the end of may  worse quality of sewing ive ever seen  i have numerous lazy boys 70s early 2000s and this is the worst ive ever seen my old ones look like new even today  dont buy this product any more  there quality has really taken a nose dive  i think walmart would have been a better choice  lazy boy is replacing this one part but looking at it id say i give it less than six months ill be calling again  real junk     
i really liked staying here me and my boyfriend came here for a quick getaway  nice pool area and bar  and the spa was amazing  i would recommend going if youre gonna stay here 
i like it    i definitely like it   i will start off by saying for the 2 times we have been so far  great service  better service the 1st time  i would say great   and good service the second time  your glass is never empty  you need something  someone is there to help you   the hostesses are friendly and nice  yes you read that right    this is a rarity in scottsdale  in my opinion   they are accommodating and down to earth   food  its a good menu  good amount of salads and pizza and starters  we have pretty much almost sampled all the starters  def tasty  my only comment would be that the grilled vegetables should look a little more robust  but still delicious  the pizza is a hit  the minestrone is good too   the desserts are the highlight  we have eaten through 80  of them   the atmosphere is fun  casual  there always seem to be tables  i appreciate the fun fresh aspect of this place  and its a good change from the other italian places that are so watered down  definitely going again 
eh  i mean  not too much going on here  its ok for an hour  i bought tickets on line so atleast the cost for that hour wasnt that bad 
my first comment  can you get a real kids menu  just even if you print it on toilet paper or anything  just anywhere  i went with my kids  cause yelp says its kid friendly    and when i asked if they had burgers for kids  the lady at the register told me they could do grilled cheese or order the classic burger with just the patty  it comes with cheese  lettuce  tomato etc   same size burger as the adult burger  same price  just 50  less stuff  hmmmmm  not asking to reinvent the wheel here  just saying  i looked around on a saturday afternoon and there were a good amount of kids   overall the burgers were good  obviously i ate a lot of left overs from my kids   i hate throwing good food away       i had the caesar salad  not necessarily low cal  with grass fed beef  it was delicious  truffle fries were on par with the regular fries if you ask me  they only come in one size  large        its a bit confusing walking in  where do you order  cant read the menu properly  wait  how do we get a table  but besides that def will come again  the burgers are great 
we arrived right after the buffet ended and the employees let us go ahead and take advantage of the buffet special   the place was clean   the employees were helpful and seemed eager to give good customer service   they even let us take our leftovers home 
the absolute worst service ive ever had  they served us raw chicken  old food  and then when i came in to get my refund   manager approved  they told me to go dive in my dumpster and get the raw chicken and bring it back in order for a refund 
terrible trying to get lab results that i paid for from these clowns   its like they deliberately want to keep them from you   go anywhere else or youll be sorry   dont say i didnt warn you 
theres nothing wrong with calling a good food dish what it is  but here they call their tomato meat sauce  bolognese  and thats not what it is   bolognese doesnt come close to this dish   it just doesnt  look up the classic recipe and compare it to this    you get the feeling someone is opening an aseptic bag and heating its predictable  measured corporate contents   you end up with really good airline food  service was attentive and the cocktails didnt skimp   a lot of families with small children for a saturday night 
awesome food    try their pho and pasta and etc  its a small business go support them 
i am reaching out to the preferred home care senior management to seek help for getting my sons formula  he is severely allergic and does not tolerate anything outside of the prescribed formula  this formula is not available in pharmacies around here and we have tried in vain to reach out to this company seeking a feedback on when the delivery could arrive   we feel helpless at this situation and seek immediate feedback or help 
this was close enough to my room that i didnt have to go far  i have a broken foot and am using crutches to walk  i get to the front of the line to order the tomato mozzarella sandwich  they have one on display that looks delicious  i had to explain to the lady that i would like it to go  there was no place to sit  but i need a bag with handles to carry it  it took awhile but she finally said ok  so im back at my room and the sandwich is disappointing   its soggy  just thrown together  and just plain gross  ive had better sandwiches at starbucks  considering this is a  13 sandwich  i would never go here again 
i used to build and repair computers back in the day  and this was my go to place  compared with other retail stores  they always had the lowest prices  ideal when shopping for parts to upgrade your machine  they have a large selection of hard drives  ram  video cards  and motherboards  be sure to check out their website  its updated regularly  and they dont keep their entire inventory out on the floor  ive found its best to do your research online  ahead of time   even call them before dropping in to make sure they have what your looking for in stock  you can also buy pre built machines  have them customize a machine for you  and special order parts if theyve sold out  they even offer an additional discount if you pay cash  in store   recommended for all moderate to full blown computer geeks   http     www microbytes com
should have read the reviews before coming here   agree with other yelpers re bad customer service  unorganized  dirty carts  unprofessional  slow  gave our slot to other group twice   dont come here and waste your time and money 
excellent taco bell   conveniently located right by the hospital   the restaurant is always clean  the food is always delicious  and the staff is always so friendly 
yes he food is cheap and you get some good deals  the food is usually spoiled or molded  i always get the salmon sashimi  and it seems past its prime  i dont know one time i asked them to load more salmon sashimi could because they ran out and the guy started cutting salmon from the regular salmon that was non sashimi grade and that really scared me away  maybe the guy wasnt trained at the same time thats a very scary thing to come across as a customer  now to their credit i never got sick from eating it but still unacceptable 
tried the chicken shawarma salad today   it was excellent   portion was large  salad was fresh  and the homemade yoghurt dressing had the right amount of garlic kick   my kids ordered the chicken wings which were good as well   take out style restaurant with a few tables   great little place for some home style cooking  healthy and at a good price point 
all i can say is that this is the best hotel in las vegas hands down    no other hotels come close  my 2nd fav is vdara but cosmopolitan is just on another dam level  beautiful rooms with the balcony view  i made sure i booked the one with the fountain view of the bellagio   man i just wish their rates werent so dam expensive but i can see why  they have the best of the best to offer  from the lobby floor with them amazing lcd screens that change every 30mins to the casino floor and back to the rooms  man i had my greatest vegas experience staying here  oh and the room service was to die for  cant wait to go back  
servers seemed rushed and acted like you are taking too long  white rice  chips  meat  all extremely salty 
this is a budget airline and i knew that going in  i paid under  300 for two roundtrip tickets from detroit to las vegas  i was given the option of paying for a carry on and picking our seats and declined it all  i checked in early and printed the boarding passes at home  instead of paying  5 10 to have them print it for me   both times i sat next to my sister  despite not picking ahead for a fee   our brother who was also traveling with us but booked seperately got a seat adjacent to us on both trips when we checked in at the same time   my sister and i used a small 16in  cheerleader   duffle bag as our free carry on  purchased off amazon for  14  and it fit easily under the seat with 4 days worth of clothes stuffed inside   the seats were tight no real leg room for a tall person  im under 55 so i was ok my brother and sis on the other hand were crammed  56 and 5 11   the snacks and drinks on board were pricey but u could easily grab snacks prior to boarding and they dont count as ur personal item  there was also no wi fi on board  staff was nice and accommodating   the flight out of detroit was rough  lots of turbulence  but i believe it was due to the weather  the return flight was fine no issues smooth  overall it was an okay experience  point being that there are ways around these extra fees because each one is optional  its a very basic way to fly for cheap not amazing but not horrid 
i have stayed at this hotel before  and have had great experiences   i stayed at this hotel over the weekend  renting a total of 3 rooms for 6 guests   in total  we had 5 cars   after checking in  we were told that we would only be allowed one spot to park for each room   this was not something that was clear when reserving the room  and i talked to the front desk to work the issue out   the staff was very friendly and we were able to work out a nice solution that would result in additional passes being given to the extra vehicles at no extra charge   i left the next morning in a good mood after a solid experience   this morning  i looked at my credit card bill and found that i had been charged for three parking fees of  20 each for cars for the hotel guests   first  i only had two extra cars  so i dont know where the third fee came from   and second  i was assured by the front desk that we would not be incurred the fees for these cars  as free parking was available about two blocks away and we would have walked two blocks to save the money    this poor service and blatant lying assures that i will not be staying at this hotel again  despite prior positive experiences   i would advise others to closely check their credit card statements after staying at this hotel 
ok  i agree that the food is great  but for the price and the reviews  i was expecting a bit better interior design   the walls are painted dark gray  and there are exposed wires   speakers   the  leather chairs  are basically just club chairs  which are ok  but not exceptional   i can get better atmosphere in a houstons    i felt like i was in a  design on a dime  renovation that are supposed to look nice  but still pretty cheap   i was disappointed in the glassware as well   the water glasses were these clunky amber glasses that you can find in a sizzler   the tables are very close together  and i was bothered by the fact that i had to bump up into someone else just to get into my seat     seriously  i could spruce this place with a quick trip to target      maybe my mistake is that i had high aspirations for montreal cuisine having been to toque  which blew my mind  and several other fantastic restaurants in the area   as for the food   it was not over the top   it definitely was excellent  well prepared  and relatively creative     we did the tasting menu  and were served 4 courses   the scallops were fantastic   the risotto was perfectly cooked  and the boar was excellent   i just didnt feel that it got the  over the top  rating that had been recommended   i suggest that the owners remove a table or two  getting a  real  interior decorator  changing out the cheap glassware for glassware that goes with the wine and food  and paying attention to the details   its the little things that matter  and although they came through on the execution of the food  they lacked sufficient creativity  and skimped on the atmosphere     for almost  300  i expect top food  top service  and details   get the details right  and you get another star   wow me and you get another 
when your  greek  in laws all agree its one of the top greek restaurants for the money  theyre absolutely right  the greek salad is surprisingly unique and certainly the best in town in my opinion  i was actually impressed it surpassed milos and mythos ones  shrimps are huge and good  lamb chops    well everything we had was good  i over ate  your meal always comes with potatoes  yummy ones  and the  amazing  greek salad  there is a small terrace at the front  portions are generous  service was ok  but hey  you go there for the food  excellent value 
its one of the reason why i visit toronto  as good as this  worth the trip from montreal  everything is good but my highlights  bonne marrow  the smoke meat  sweatbreads
i love this place    the environment is welcoming  calm and relaxing   all the people who work here are friendly and it is very clean   i go here to visit cassandra for everything   hair color  cuts  waxes   and styles for any event   not only do i trust her with my own hair  but i also take my daughter   who has very very curly hair   cassandra has been the only person ive gone to for the past 15 years  my mother sister and her fam all go to her as well  we know we can walk out looking great without a doubt  highly recommended 
i ate in and the staff was really great  they brought me my food and came around to make sure i was enjoying my meal  the bath rooms were clean and this sounds dumb but they have a really cool drink dispencer
i dont write many reviews but i thought that the rokerij deserves everyone to know how awesome it is  my favorite spot is down in the cellar bar for brunch  my boyfriend is from nm and we can never find good nm food that is close to what its like back home  the rokerij   richardsons  dicks hideaway is as close as it gets  the huevos rancheros are amazing  handheld burritos  rokerij steak  steak skewers and my favorite in the summer   blood orange mimosas  i love this place and will continue to keep coming back   
service was great  i liked my jambalaya except there was one random chicken bone in the jambalaya  i didnt complain but it definitely made me lose my appetite   i am sure  had i complained they would have changed the bowl  hence not dinging them on it  nice ambience  definitely worth going at least once 
this place has the best pizza ive ever tried  the flavor  ingredients  and the way they make the pizza is amazing  the service is great and the price too for the quality of the pizza  highly recommend 
i really hope the owner jay reads this  this is a salad place  they make salads  shouldnt be that hard  our office has been coming here for 4 years  and finally decided to say something  first  the staff  they have 1 good employee  the rest are lazy and just dont care  no pride in doing their job  the house dressing is different each and every time i order it  somet times it is thin  sometimes gelatinous  and some times just oily with no flavor   brown lettuce  why cant the lettuce be fresh and crisp  i dont want brown lettuce and those hard white parts either  the place is dirty  clean it up  please  be a salad place and provide the one thing you specialize in   salads 
calzonie   i love clock work pizza  me and my co worker have fri zone day where we eat a calzone every fri  a large calzone for  9 feeds us both and we are more than stuffed and normally have a piece or two to give out    word of advice ask for extra butter and garlic on top and it will be perfect   top it off with a piece of chocolate moose cake  wham bam perfect combo for an amazing friday lunch
beautiful relaxing atmosphere to match the good vibes of people that work there  alex took her time making me feel comfortable and making sure i felt and looked beautiful  i love that they use all natural products and my hair stayed in place and looked great without having to be weighed down by hair spray   i was very happy with visit to abloom salon
ordered a burger and fried pickles and decided to go down and pick it up instead of having it delivered to the room  1  it was ready almost 30 minutes after i was told it would be ready  2  they did not include the ranch dip with the pickles  when i called they said they would bring the sauce right up  but they never showed    surprise     the burger was ok  but a little dry  not worth the hype  i would review the pickles but they got too cold to eat while i was waiting for the dip 
went here based on yelp reviews  i had the liver  okay not most peoples favorite  i like it   it was marvelous  the seasoning and vegetables were the best ive ever had   my wife had the soup  salad  sandwich and said it was wonderful   the desert was also great   we had wonderful live entertainment as well   the service was great   just right   well be back 
tony and his team are great porsche guys   you can count on them to provide you candid answers to your porsche needs  they have provided me with assistance on my 996 and 944s 
a good source of novas breads   which i used to buy regularly at harris teeter before they went corporate with their own brand   the breads are i assume shipped into this smaller outlet from novas main bakery off central   if you live in matthews or mint hill  its a good resource for great bread   much better than the tasteless stuff with poor texture the grocery chains keep pushing  
not many places get well done as right as this place     our burgers  both ordered well  were exactly timed right  just out of pink   fries were ok  nothing special  but not greasy   fried pickles were spicier than most places     were wedge cut claussens i believe  enjoyed them   lots of tvs but the noise level was quite low actually    we were there around 5 on a friday   seemed pricey at first  but when you factored in that the burger price included the fries  it works out about the same as ordering those separately at places like 5 guys 
did not seem to want our business   contacted then in the late fall  to get some fascia repaired and gutters removed  got lost twice coming to our address   who does that anymore with gps    and looked around telling us what we needed  rather than what i wanted   said theyd email me a quote   never did   i followed up with emails and phone messages left at their office   no response   so i wasted a couple weeks trying to get them to get back to me and quote  and ended up having to postpone all the work until after winter   just as well as i found a good competent contractor nearby who did the work responsibly and at a reasonable price   thanks for nothing mike 
retro bleu cafe is a hidden gem    i mean that both figuratively and literally  since this little place is tucked away in an old little building next to a car wash  if you are not intentionally looking for this place  you probably wouldnt even notice it  i found retro bleu on the yelp app when i was looking for a place to grab some lunch  a few interesting places came up on my search but this place caught my eye when i saw a picture of one of their bento boxes  ooh la la  im in love  my eyes definitely turned into hearts when i saw all the pictures of their food  did someone say garlic fried chicken wings and manapua   marry me    garlic fried chicken wings   ono  sweet  crispy breading on the outside and juicy on the inside  the wings were a decent size  too  great with rice     but then again  everything goes with rice for me   mac salad   decent  it was a great addition to the wing plate  however it wasnt very memorable    original bento   yas  garlic fried chicken wings  bbq beef  shrimp tempura  redondo hot dog  spam and rice with furikake  what a line up  comfort food galore  insert more heart eyes here   garlic shrimp fries   delicious shrimp  about 6  and a mountain of fries  cant go wrong with this combination  a great app to share or even a meal for one    manapua   a fluffy bun filled with bbq pork   who can say no  not even me  because i ate all that food yet i still bought a manapua to go  and trust me  that manapua didnt make it too far since i scarfed it down in the car  no shame in my nom nom game   the service was great and i know that i will be back again  a trip to retro bleu is pretty far for me but it will be worth the drive every time  if you are looking for legit hawaiian comfort food  you need to check out retro bleu 
essence and herbs is located near the lake las vegas marina  there isnt much at lake las vegas  so i found myself here  there was a dj and it sounded like it was crowded  note that i said  sounded like    since it wasnt crowded at all    walked in and stood there for at least 10 minutes with no one asking if i was being helped  i saw servers walking to and from the patio and even other servers standing at the back by the kitchen  i picked up a menu from the hostess table and browsed while i stood there  and stood there  i made eye contact with a few of the servers and attempts to say something  but no one came to help me  but hey  at least the music was good  high five for that dj    i was just about to leave when finally someone came  i ordered a coke to go and then 10 minutes later  the guy comes back with a can of coke and for  4   yeah  id like to think that i helped a struggling business survive in that ghost town with the cost of that coke as my contribution  sorry  i will not come back here 
it was almost midnight and all i could think about was how much i wanted some chow mein  not the kind of chow mein from a cheap  take out place but the real stuff  i searched chinese food in my yelp app and joyful house came up first on the results  the reviews had me sold  so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack    the parking lot was a little dark  but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed  the restaurant had about two tables filled  now three once we all sat down  must be a good place if there are people here eating chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight  we ordered soft noodles  salt and pepper pork  minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef  came on a hot plate   all of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made   just what i was craving for  it was delicious and i would definitely come back again  i especially like how late the joyful house stays open and how accommodating the service was  our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment i scarfed it all down  we definitely felt welcomed  even when it was probably past our servers bed time  and mine  too     i definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting las vegas and craves some authentic chinese food   not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the meh broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet  joyful house does chinese food right and i will definitely be back for more 
atmosphere here is fun  the wait is a little long but thats okay  they are actually making your drink  and not pre made  so i dont mind the wait at all  from my last experience at the old bomboba spot  i like this place better  closer to my place  the worker here is welcoming  and they seem like they like their job  which is good to see   this place is the only place maybe around tollison open till midnight  i love that  so late night munchies  craving  this place is the place to go to  i would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for refreshing cold drinks   
come in just about every other week  not once have i had to wait in line  quick  friendly service    plus  that spicy queso sauce is what pushed it over the top when compared to cafe rio or ecoli stricken chipotle  just alittle pricey but definitely worth it
recall that ecoli break out a couple years ago  i have not  and will not  be returning  i had the luck of experiencinge liquid coming out of both ends for 4 days straight  not one time  but twice  two weekends apart  i even got compensation for buy one get one burrito offers in my email  but im not about to take that risk  plus  theyre always busy with a long line  wait  ill take my ten bucks to qdoba or cafe rio
the manager was nice  the whoppers i had fresher than usual  however very poor cost value ratio  the food is overpriced for what you get 
gypsy is a very welcoming and laid back establishment  the coffee is good and decently priced  if hungry  they have many different options to choose from  pizza  to pastries  and more   the staff are always nice and timely  i suggest trying the world  lastly  they recently took down the walls in the back and the open space is great 
first off my technician was amazing cecilia  extremely friendly and very precise  but the product this place uses is no good  cheap quality glue and lash   ive had extensions before and have never experienced the allergic reaction i have now ever   i did notice a burning sensation while they were being applied but i just figured it was normal since duh they are on your eyes  but now i had to remove each and everyone of them due to this horrible reaction i cant seem to get rid of  my eyes are bloodshot  again 5 stars for cecilia but zero for everything else 
this place replaces the old comedy zone that was near a seedy uptown  motel  its located in what is known as the nc music factory  a slew of bars  music venues   restaurants that has become the destination for a night out in charlotte  youll have to walk through a saloon bar to get to the entrance to the club   which is downstairs  the layout is good  wait staff is attentive  great location  reasonable drink prices   decent food  considering youre in a comedy club   on par with tgifs  good national   regional acts  this is basically the only game in town for comedy  that being said  comedy zone delivers 
i had a water heater leak and i found schuelke plumbing on the web and im glad i did the plumber that came out was very knowledgable showed up early and installed a new water heater at a fair price  explained to how it worked why it went bad and what could do to extend the life of it  i will be using them again
came in for lunch had chicken fried steak it he food was good service was good im giving them 3 stars because the bathroom was not very clean
best carne asada and carnita tacos ive had in phoenix  their grilled chicken tacos are very tasty as well  the chips and salsa are amazing as the chips are the perfectly sturdy for scooping up globs of salsa  yet not hard as glass to keep from scraping the interior of your mouth  i cant believe i havent heard about this place beforehand  definitely a must if youre in the area  also  the steak burrito and veggie burrito were a hit amongst my group  the tortilla is freshly made and the size of the burrito should be enough to please even the hungriest of guest 
wow  what a difference a year makes  have played this course every year for the last 4 years and this year there was a dramatic improvement in both course condition and customer service  its always been a fun and interesting course to play with the best celebrity golf history in vegas  now showcased with a new las vegas golf hall of fame  course was in great shape and everyone was friendly and helpful  good drinks and food too  actually took off a little early one day and got in a 2nd round for the first time  its only about a mile east of the strip on desert inn   congrats
we went to this funeral hone and my cousin and her family were so upset from the services this company provided   she not only had to bury her son but they couldnt even get together her video she was trying to play or the audio   its sad to see my cousin have to put aside her grief to help the staff   just disappointed and un professional
went here today for lunch  it was busy but there was no line as there usually isnt during the lunch hour at this location    they made my burrito bowl extremely quick   they give good portions at this location compared to others      go here 
great tasting food and the prices arent that bad  location was very clean   the girl working the front cash register was incredibly good looking so good job there   get the chicken teriakyi bowl with rice if you come here and get some extra sauce 
i just had the pleasure of watching a hungry howies driver throw his trash out of his car window into my yard  when i asked him to pick it up  i got a f you and he drove off  thanks hungry howies  you suck 
i had the prosciutto arugula pizza which had a great sauce and flavor   service was excellent  but my wife mentioned that her linguine was ok   the seafood appetizer special was average 
this was just okay  ive had way better  nothing special 
i was referred by a friend  it truly is pleasant to see that there is a medical center that actually cares about and helps their patients  the staff are very friendly and approachable  all of them  i would recommend this medical center to anyone 
ive been to takara a handful of times now and as someone who lives in easy driving distance of it i am sad to say i didnt go there for years because of the lackluster quality of its state street branch  dont make the same mistake i did  the sushi here is very good   ive had their steak hibachi and unlike many ive had elsewhere they did not cook the steak into a dried out mess but left it still somewhat tender  the rice was good and overall the meat    rice    vegetable ratio is pretty close to optimal    as far as their sushi ive had a variety of rolls and found them all to be very good  as i tend to favor simpler rolls rather than their more elaborate fair thats about all i can say for them but others ive gone with have gotten the fancy ones and at the very least they are beautifully crafted  since i did not steal their food    thats what ive got    their ambiance feels very japanese which is something lacking even in some of the better sushi restaurants in madison    on state street  hit up wasabi  but if you are on the near west side and need a sushi fix    you ought to go to takara 
ive been to the pickle jar about four times in the last 6 months    partially based on convenience but also because they have a nice  sassy southern bbq sauce that i like  as a departure from my usual preference for sweet bbq    ive had their brisket twice and their chicken twice and on my most recent trip i decided to try to beans    these are the items ill review but they also have a few more menu options in case you want to check on those  too   brisket  the first time i had the brisket it was somewhat dry  i chalked this up to a bad day and the second time i obtained it i was proven correct  that being said    i wasnt crazy about it  it was alright but it just didnt scratch that brisket itch  i didnt feel like the pickle worked with the brisket very well  either  all in all its a 2 5   3 star brisket and thats not too bad for a food cart   chicken  this is where itches for bbq get scratched  both times i had the chicken and it has been tender and delicious  the sauce really shines with it  too  couple this with the pickle jars signature pickles which did heighten the flavor of an already good sandwich    yeah  its definitely a 4 star chicken sandwich which    for something as pedestrian as that    well  yeah  theres a reason thats probably what ill be getting any time i visit them   beans  oof  i did not care for these at all  mine were a little soupy and some of the beans still a little hard  this was the reason i didnt go a full on four for these folks despite their great bbq chicken  if it was like the brisket and they had an off day    the day was really off  off to the extent that id rather not try these again to find out     all told    theyre a reasonably priced food cart  their sauce reminded me a little of trips to austin  and while they stumble on a couple of things they definitely have their chicken nailed 
awesome experience     i get freaked out with anything that has to do with guns  but these guys made me feel comfortable and safe with their proffesionalism and stellar service     mike picked us up from the hotel and drove us right over to the range  he was on time  extremely pleasant and polite  and very informative  our instructor was devin and he was the man too   hats off to these guys  will be back next time in vegas for sure  
food is great  especially the french onion dip they have   im assuming its home made   its a small restaurant  but ive never had to wait long if i wasnt seated right away 
hands down my all time favorite restaurant   i always stick with the chicken pho and an order of summer rolls   since being introduced to saigon ive tried other restaurants and their pho doesnt even compare   the prices are also incredibly reasonable    i would give them more stars if i could 
i wish i could give his place zero stars      we made a reservation here for one of the nights for our honeymoon  due to some changes we had to cancel our stay here  we canceled more than 2 weeks prior  with a confirmation and everything  and they still charged us  before we even  check in     when we called to correct this error  anna was the most rude person i have ever tried to talk with  she hung up on us multiple times  yelled at us  and more  she refused to work with both us or hotel com  hotel com faxed over 3 different times the proof of cancelation  and they still refused to work with us  or allow us to speak with a manager    i have never delt with such rude costumer service and fraudulent behavior    in reply to their comment  we got the charges reversed  and you guys where the ones to charge us  not hotels com  there was no apology when it happened  and no willingness to work with us to figure what happened  dont worry  we wont be booking with you in the future
i go here when i feel like it  most of the time for take out   food  the kimchi fries are quite yummy  i dont eat a lot so i prefer to share them with another person  it is amazing how the light mayo  fries and kimchi work out together  for some it may not be the most appetizing mix  i got sweet potato fries from here before  i am not very picky on greasiness so no opinion on those  you have the option of dipping them in the light mayo or ketchup  often i would order the steamed bao  i prefer the fried chicken and five spice pork belly  i have never tried the banh mi from here  i like to stick to the regular kind for cheaper somewhere else   atmosphere   service  the staff give off a hip hop vibe and work very efficiently  after ordering  you move to the inside where they prepare your food behind the counter and wait for your name to be called  the graffiti artwork on the wall is colourful and cool to observe  when your name is called  they ask how spicy you want your food to be    pricing  the contents in their banh mi has more variety so i guess it is understandable that they are priced more than the regular ones you find else where  prices for other items are reasonable 
this review is based on one visit and mainly from taste of the one drink ordered  rating can change in the future    i got the rose oolong tea with mousse  compared to other bubble tea shops  the mousse was not as packed with the salty  cheesy taste  the flavour of the rose oolong tea was subtle  not much changed when the mousse was mixed in  i still have yet to try the bubble waffle ice cream and tea with durian mousse   the service was fast and the servers were friendly  there is free wifi in the shop  password can be found near the cashier  
best massage ever   trevia was my therapist  she s amazing  i kid you not   my husband also says its the best massage hes ever had   try this place  you will not regret it   also they offer lots of different ways to make your massages affordable  just ask 
i want to give them 5 stars   ive stopped going to the s e  gilbert location and ive switched to ocotillo because they offer twice as many classes and it is much cleaner and they seem to have towels available at any time  the downside here is despite paying for childcare they will not allow my children into this location so i have to make alternate arrangements if i choose to use the ocotillo location    my husband and i have been taking turns going but my kids miss out on their own  kids workout         i joined in 2004 and at that time  their motto was  the friendliest gym in town  which was true back then   another bummer is you pay your normal membership but if you want to take xxxx challenging class its another  100 00  the facility is nice and its close to home but theres a lot of competition building around it  these small places are popping up all over  as i said almost 8 years with them and they have not been nice over the last 1 1  2  id love it if they could go back to being the friendliest gym in town 
by far the best indian cuisine ive had in charlotte   far better than woodlands or saffron   the lunch buffet is fine  and a good deal for the price  but their dinners are quite a bit better 
check out my before and after pictures  then call to book an appointment or come see me for your color  cut  hair extensions  etc  
desiree is by far the best hair dresser i have ever met    so happy with my hair and will be a diligent customer for the rest of my life    thank you thank you thank you   
i cannot say enough about how fantastic brianna is   from her gentle nature to her professionalism  she is just the most amazing and educated individual i have ever met   ive had only one makeup lesson and have already gained so much knowledge  ive booked her for another session and cannot wait  i highly recommend her to any and everyone  i just love her 
overall  i cant tell you how much i love bouchon    food  so delicious  i always have to eat here whenever i am in vegas or yountville  always comes out with fresh warm epi bread and butter  crispy pork belly salad was so delicious  beef bourguignon was so tender  dessert was so irresistible    liquor  ordered a bottle of burgundy  hot dayam its expensive but so good   complemented the food    decor  nice high ceilings  booths  tables are not so close together so there is alot of walking room   service  so great  waiters  busboys will always keep your water and wine glass filled  they have knowledge of all the items on the  menu and the wine list  just a reminder that it will take awhile between your courses since they want you to enjoy the company your with and talk and savor your food  if you are in a rush   dont go here   note  kinda hard to get to the location since its sorta outside of the venetian   so make sure to ask people who work at the venetian to point you the right direction  always make reservations 
very unimpressed  limited menu  fairly high priced  and my breakfast was very bland  in addition the side of pancakes were over done   almost burnt  im still trying to understand how an omelette can have 5 ingredients and taste like paper  i enjoy going out to eat for breakfast more than any other meal and ive had much better in the east side  i was really looking forward to this place opening since its so close to my house but i wont be going back 
great option if youre looking to get away from the chain restaurants in streetsboro  went for drinks and apps while back home visiting some family  so happy to have this as an option  the drinks were insanely good and the apps hit the spot  great atmosphere all around 
im more of a same day brow appointment girl  lets be real  i realize i look like a caveman and have to make a last minute appointment    lunchbox has been great for that  not only are their hours super accommodating  but every single one of their brow specialists are phenomenal  i have seen several different people there and never once walked out disappointed  love you guys 
i am so disappointed that red koi no longer existed  i knew when i ordered something was different  portion size is tiny for the same price  being from san jose  i know good vietnamese food when i taste it and the vermicelli was a joke  more like dry noodles w a small tablespoon of fish sauce in a shot glass  i had to ask for more and i got the same small cup that was practically empty   obviously there is no customer service here  the pho was salty  and now the portion size of everything is micro  once a regular customer and now im never coming back  found a new sushi restaurant for a replacement  now i just need a local vietnamese place 
food is amazing   great family atmosphere  patrick and his wife are also amazing    my husband and kids go here at least four time a month  and the new location is way bigger than the last location
we have always had positive experiences here  they have great customer service and prices are good too 
harvey has been our realtor for several years as we watched the market waiting for the right time to sell  buy and was always willing to answer our questions and do the research with no pressure  we used him recently to sell our house and purchase a new one and he was professional and personable and went over and above  he navigated a difficult purchase and helped us get an incredible deal  we would recommend harvey to anyone and he will be our first call for all future real estate needs 
delicious offerings   healthy and tasty   it a must try  if you are looking for delicious portioned  fully cooked entrees you have to give them a try   great for folks exercising and loosing weight or folks who want delicious food without having to cook and clean up 
we have been here a couple times and it seems like the food quality and service has started to decline   i guess they are too big now to keep the quality  too bad 
my wife and i had visited the location in orange county  ca several years ago with some friends   we were recently given a gift card for the melting pot and had the opportunity to go to the las vegas location   the resturant is quite small  when we arrives at 6 30 on a sunday it was full  mostly couples   we ordered the 4 course meal  we started with the spinach and artichoke dip  then salads   for the main course we both ordered the steak lovers  we were alread full    you get about  6oz of meat with the entree    for dessert we had the flaming turtle   over all the food was pretty good  the dining experience is what most people are there for   service was a little slow  it took 3 hours from the time we were seated until we paid the bill   we were out of there for about  115 with tax and tip 
after a recommendation from our neighbors we took our gsd zorra to town center animal hospital   the facilities are top notch and the staff is very friendly   our dogs doctor is dr sanabria and he is outstanding   he always takes the time to answer all of our questions and you can tell he cares about the animals he takes care of   they also have 24 emergency service as well   if you are looking for the best animal hospital in summerlin tcah is it 
we are very happy with our pulte home   any issues we had  even though they were minor  were resolved within 24 hours   every one we had contact with was very friendly   home is very well built  finished on time  and extremely energy efficient   we looked at several homes before purchasing our current home and couldnt be happier 
great zoo   animals are well kept and exhibits and grounds are clean   we have been a few times and purchase a season pass for our family   they will credit you daily admission fee towards the price of the membership if you purchase it the same day   we plan on visiting monthly  so the pass will pay for itself on the third visit 
i just come here for their wonton soup   clear broth   always perfect if you are needing something healthy   healthy chinese food   ive had a few other dishes   but mainly come here for soup if under the weather   fast take out 
four trips to fix oil leak that was never fixed and had four different reasons for the leaks  three trips for check engine lights with three different reasons for the light  final trip determined that we needed a new engine for  12000 new  6000 used or  6500 repaired   invoice stated we declined the repair  still had problems with the initial repair   had to get rid of the car   lost over  3600 unnecessarily   lesson learn  seek a 2nd and 3rd opinion from other automotive services especially if you own a toyota   they should have determined we needed the engine on the first trip 
friendly fast  real fast service with quality sushi  i just found a new sushi spot in vegas  the servers were really attentive and always kept your cups and plates filled  if your interested in trying some vegas sushi come over here 
i got pre sale tickets and i still had to wait in line  wtf these people think that they are hollywood and hold the fukn line    gtfoh   especially the head  line  security in charge of general admission in line and such  relax asshole your job is to watch the line  not police the area  not trynna play the race card but hes the older black gentleman everybodys familiar with if youve ever been to xs    the club itself is cool  the other staff members do there jobs without the asshole complex      i doubt i visit again but if i do ill come hella early to avoid assholes who work here 
great coffee  the staff were the nicest people i have found in kensington and the coffee was actually good  i was very impressed  really want to go back and try some of their cookies 
oh sahhh  dude     the pineapple upside down pancakes are to die for    thanks for the awesome breakfast and im sure ill be back for cakes and caps in a hop  skip  and a jump   
eh   stopped by for some white pine   what we got was very rough   definitely felt like the staff didnt have time for questions  their office is full of sarcastic signs about customer service and they dumped us on an intern within 30 seconds of walking through the door   do yourself a favor   head to mcgee 
pretty good breakfast food especially for a hangover at vegas  portuguese sausage with eggs and garlic fried rice is my fav  you have to get garlic fried rice  took a star off cause they didnt give bigger portions  banana cream pie pancakes were good but you kinda get sick of the banana flavor  next time ill try the red velvet pancakes 
this place is awesome  the vibe is great  the girls behind the counter were nice and helpful  and lets talk about the food    we had a party of 8  we all got something different and we all raved about how yummy it was  good job skinnyfats 
located on mcclintock  in the plaza with trader joes  if youre a first time customer  they give you coupons to help bring you back  their service is amazing  always willing to help and happy to serve you  they always carry dog food that has the top notch ingredients and are not expensive at all  compared to petsmart or petco  i also love that they have an area where you can give your furry best friend a bath  they also carry fresh and refrigerated pet food as well    parking is definitely easy to find  spots right in front of the store are usually open  if its not  the plaza is huge enough to find one 
i thought the whole idea for the cold stone was to mix things with the ice cream you order  didnt happen when i was there  the girl barely touched it  threw it in the cup    called for the next in line   not impressed 
a good place for breakfast  lunch early in the morning or afternoon  they have a decent basic menu and good coffee  its amazing how many places do not serve a good brew  its also one of the few places that would substitute your hash brown with nice white rice upon request   rice and omelet with coffee at a reasonable price  whats not to like  do request a window view if available  it will makes a big difference in your experience 
great place for happy hour   4 7pm   ive had both the triple sliders and the half rack ribs  on different days btw   if you near 101   n  scottsdale near happy hour  this is the best place in the area to eat 
two years ago  my dad and i were looking to get haircuts before his big 50th birthday party   we saw an ad for paul beaune ny salon in a local magazine and decided to stop by and check it out   they took us as walk ins when we got there   ive never had trouble getting an appointment since   the place isnt empty  they do a good business  but its never overly crowded or busy  so they can conentrate on the clients they have at the time   as soon as you check in  they offer you a drink  and all of the staff is very friendly   ive had my hair cut by three different stylists  all of whom have done a wonderful job  and for a very reasonable price   i got a lovely haircut yesterday for  20 less than my salon at home in ny   the use bumble   bumble and kerastase products   they also dont go overboard on product  like some salons  and always ask if you want hairspray  which i love  as i dont want too much stuff in my hair   if youre really up for a day of pampering  had next door for a mani pedi  and to the caribou coffee in the same plaza for a delicious coffee 
i hadnt had food from here in years since visiting ca but i was super happy to find one on the strip  delicious food  it was super packed but i didnt mind waiting  good prices compared to other places on the strip
amazing  the woman inline next to me was back for the second time today  its that good   i ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and the kale salad   both were amazing   i polished it off with the chocolate lava cake   its gluten free   winning   note   the address says grand canyon  but its in a little strip mall in front of target  in the same parking lot   if you are coming from the 215 on flamingo  go through the light at grand canyon and make the next left   you will see it on the right hand side 
the good  the food when its fresh prepared  amazing  try the zucchini pancakes  and the people who work here are kick ass  the bad  when you buy fresh food as groceries from here  half the time its rotten or almost rotten
this is a better location that others  i always have tofu tacos and my mom enjoyed the chicken quesadilla  large portions  so wasnt able to finish    the only issue with this location  is its very hard and confusing on how to get there  you see this tiny sign and then you have to turn left through other cars backed up at a light 
goat cheese app was to die for  bf said he couldnt speak for a moment  served with black tortillas  yum  the chille relleno with eggplant was amazing  panko fried  bobby flay definitely did not disappoint 
such a great community   not only is it beautifully and well maintained  but the staff is great   they are so helpful and respond quickly when necessary  the community areas are awesome i just wish we had a fire pit     maybe more planned community events to meet your neighbors  but
we went on sunday around 3 30pm  it was empty   5 or 6 tables  there was no many choices as used to be before  and the taste was not that great   expensive for what we got   we payed  47 before tax and tips 
buddhist bowl   awful  the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients   asked for extra spicy  instead of cooking with peppers  they give a container of hot sauce   manchu wok was 10x better
i used to fly to dc to get my hair done every 5 weeks as i could not find anywhere i liked in my new city of vegas  that is until i met jennifer at arcs  she is superb    updated my do    and my color and gives a killer scalp massage to boot    the prices are extremely reasonable for a salon on this caliber 
first time ever trying korean bbq and this was the right place to go  pricy for the buffet dinner but there is soooo much food  the idea to cook your food yourself is fun  im not a big seafood fan but there is a wide range of meats to choose from
got me new new juice   d highly recommended  clean shop  great service  will come back when in town again  from la  
they have the best tacos   burritos ever do love mines with the ten hot sauce  the meat has such a great flavor  i eat here at least once or twice a week 
ive been going to dr  chambers for a year  all three appointments that ive had at his office  i waited between 3 5 hours before being seen  he is a nice dr    makes you feel comfortable however the front desk needs some help  i happen to work in the medical field  i work front and back office so i understand how an office should be ran    my last appointment at this office i called and told them i was expecting to run a few mins late  the receptionist said  you cant be over 15 mins late  otherwise we have to reschedule you  plus charge you  25  i said okay ill be there in enough time  i get there with 5 mins to spare  i sign in and the young lady says that the dr isnt in yet  i waited 3 hours for the dr  i should have charged them  25 for my time 
shes the best in town  always welcomes you with a smile and gives you a stamp card for a free threading after a few visits  5 stars all the way   
love this place  good food  good wine and a lovely patio  i will be back  i got the pino grigio flight and the fruit and cheese platter  wonderful experience 
i love this place for a conversation with good  unique drinks  and great food  its got an awesome patio for people watching in the front along freemont street and also a very cute back patio  always enjoy a nice drink and appetizer at park  one of my favorite downtown bars 
after having a stylist discontinue service i found latoya and i absolutely love my hair  she is professional her studio is gorgeous and clean and my favorite part is no dryer time     if youre looking for a new stylist please go to her you will not regret it  
i have been looking for a beauty supply for a while now and im glad that i found get sassy  the store is nice and clean and syerita was great    im use to the beauty supply in la where everyone has stank attitude so this one is like a breath of fresh air   i will come back to this beauty supply for all my hair care needs  thanks get sassy
a less than hygienic caricature of george costanza worked the grill  upset that he was carried to term  he directed me to the back of the dive to order fries  something seemingly impossible to do from the main counter  despite the fact that they were also being cooked there at the time    the hot dog was a shriveled mess  a circumcised member that spent too much time in a swimming pool  which could explain georges disgruntled demeanor    the fries were hailed as one of the  best french fries in the u s   by cnns laura kiniry  i can only assume that continence must be her strong suit  the fries were bland  starchy and undercooked  better fries can be found at butter joint  wingharts  and every single other restaurant that ive been to in pittsburgh that serves them  those that voted these fries as pittsburgh magazines  best of  are of niggardly sensibility   the milk shake was vanilla and fine 
spak brothers is by far the best pizza ive had in pittsburgh  though thats no impressive feat  overall a decent pie  though the crust isnt great  id avoid the small pies  they seem to be significantly different than the individual slices and larger pies   im slightly put off by the fact that they offer vegan cheese substitutes  no self respecting pizza pie parlor should lower the quality of their offerings at the behest of self aggrandizing fad dieters masquerading as moral juggernauts 
its not so much the coffee  its great  or the food  donuts  they are great as well   its the service and the smiles they give you when you walk in the door  every employee there is great  friendly  up beat and fun  this is my place in the morning 
anyone who has tried this place and didnt like their creations has a stick up their hindquarters  it is way better than that freezerburned nightmare that also inhabits mill ave  shudder   the baked bear is delicious  their warm cookies and brownies have the best ice cream sandwiched between and i have yet to find their match  definitely a place to take out of towners and indulge in their life changing sandwiches 
i really liked this kitschy little cafe  it is located in a tiny house in phoenix right at the center of all the action for first friday events  they have many different selections for coffee and smoothies and you can tell they love what they do  great products and great atmosphere  i only wish they had more food options  there are pastries but not a variety of other sweets  treats  also  dont come here if you are claustrophobic  there is little room to move or even wait in line and loud music is played at night  otherwise  i really enjoyed the berry smoothie 
these burgers are the freakin business  i love everything about this place  the building in itself is like a neat on the beach burger shack  its very close  kinda loud  and very tasty  the chips and salsa changed my life  not sure what type of chips they used but i was funneling that junk in my mouth nonstop  it took a very long time for the burgers to come out but it was well worth it  on a busy day  if you have like 2 hours to spare  definitely come here and enjoy your much needed rehab 
okay first off  this place gets one star   and all i did was stand in the doorway  i have never experienced an such injustice as i have had here at this establishment  do not go to hi fi unless you a  have a deep conditioned and obviously highlighted man bun  b  a black v neck accentuating your lack of of a body  or c  have a sick sense of entitlement and the mentality that your mother squeezed you into this world and god blessed the very earth with your presence to literally nod people into a second rate bar  my anger is incredible towards this place   but it is warranted  i came here with friends for a birthday and we waited in line patiently because we had men in our group  mind you these are black men  and before you say  oh boy  heres another  blacklivesmatter  stand outside with a black t shirt and fist raised  angry black woman  let me tell you  youre wrong  i really dont give in easily to the politics of this social media fueled rabble rousing  but i do give a crap about fairness and equality  our male black companions were denied from entering the establishment because of their race  despite the bouncers feeble attempt at blaming it on their attire   every other man being granted entry was wearing the same shoes and clothes   so we called the bouncer out and this is how the conversation went  friend 1  well those men just went in with the same shoes  friend 2  its not about the clothes or shoes is it  bouncer  you read my mind   thats all i have to say about this place  my friends birthday night was ruined and it hurt me right in my gut that this kind of stuff happens and i was there to witness it 
great service  pretty decent food  expensive for what you get  i came here on a sunday morning and it wasnt jam packed which was nice  we ordered the  american breakfast  i believe  which was an egg sandwich with turkey bacon and seasoned potatoes   10 95 with juice as a separate charge   this meal was okay  not too much seasoning which i expected more of as this place has a very distinct flair to it  i might come back again to try something else as i feel they may excel in other areas  aside from the food  the decor and ambiance is great  they also have a gorgeous private eating area for larger groups 
fired pie is the sh      this place really changed my perception of pizza  i came here and was blown away by the  subway  like concept of ordering  i love how light yet filling the pizza is and come here frequently when i feel like pizza but dont want to sink into a deep depression after finishing a whole dominoes pizza  the actual place itself was a little messy but i guess thats to be expected when youre a busy shop 
overpriced drinks  terrible service regarding food  i wish i could review the food  but i waited over an hour and didnt get any food  the atmosphere is cool and the concept is alright  just poorly executed 
a bit small but still nice and you cant  beat the location its beautiful and its in walking distance for me and its nice that there are so many places that give you discounts for having a library card
i love the blt    every time i have gone there it has been fabulous    the staff does everything they can to make it a great experience 
i eat here and my other half does not eat thai food and will bring something for another place and they are ok with it  they have indoor and outdoor seating    they have always been nice and have great food 
staff was pushy and were a little rude when yelling at me asking if i was sure i wanted to spend the money on the guacamole  staff talked to each other more than the customers  corn was frozen coming from a person who always has their corn  and they dont cut your quessadilla even if you ask 
went there on a sunday for brunch  the place is located inside a cafeteria with other independent restaurants and some chains  mcdonalds  popeyes etc   you sit in the cafeteria to eat but they have decorated the tables around them with table cloths and small cups with flowers   as for the food  the quality was not good  you cant expect too much when the prices are cheap and portion sizes are huge  my boyfriend and i both got the supreme  i could taste the burnt  old oil through my fries  the fries were overcooked  almost bitter   while the pancake was slightly undercooked and stuck to my teeth  their bacon is super salty and again overcooked  my boyfriend on the other hand  replaced pancakes with salad  which he said was good   and got home fries instead of regular  which also turned out to be better    we both got a bunch of fruits with our meals which in my opinion was the best part of my meal  their 3 fruit juice was okay  freshly squeezed but it was 90  orange juice   tldr  i did not like it that much  but my boyfriend said the food is ok  mind you  he loves food in general  whether it is good or bad   if you want to give this place a try  do not get the regular fries or pancakes  the bacon is very salty  get the salad and if you really want fries get the home fries 
this place is a dump  ive stayed in most of the hotels in the surrounding area as my mother is in the nearby hospital  not knowing how long our stay would be  having a kitchenette seemed like a good idea  it does not make up for the fact that extended stay is the same price or more expensive than the other hotels in the area that have much nicer  better maintained facilities  more comfortable beds  cleaner rooms and public areas  and real breakfast offerings   i will say that my rating is directed solely at the corporate officers that think its ok to charge above market prices for sub par amenities and is not a reflection of the hotel staff as they seem to offer sincere service to their guests  i hope that extended stay at least treats their employees better than they treat their guests and properties 
awesome food  awesome drinks  staff is very friendly   i stopped in because my car was getting serviced next door and it was a great lunch decision  ill definitely be back 
i was nervous about coming here because of the one bad review but i was very satisfied with my entire experience  from the beginning everyone was very nice  the food was delicious  one of the managers came over and introduced herself and was very pleasant  the food was good and the sweet tea was delicious  overall i had a wonderful experience  the atmosphere is very inviting and they have great music  
we stopped by on a tuesday night and were happy to see that it was busy  we were seated promptly on the patio and had excellent service the entire night  the summer rolls  chicken satay  and drunken noodles were all outstanding  silk is now my husbands favorite place for asian food 
eating lunch here now  this place is so phenomenal that i had to stop and write about it  the employees here are magnificent  the food is incredible   our first time  and now our new favorite   check it out 
the best meat shop in york region  i love their brisket and steak sandwich  so delicious
opted for the  20  3 day plan  i should have tried the  10  day to try them out  horrible response time and my connection dropped multiple tried  i made the mistake of  living  with the problem for 3 hours as i had to get some work done  i should have cancelled the service right away  called twice to their customer service folks  who were nice at least  to rectify the situation   now i will have to escalate with my credit card company to dispute the charges  i would recommend staying away from this service provider 
lacks service and professionalism  calling my 17 year old babe   inappropriate    aside from this the french dip was sent back and replaced with over fried chicken tenders   gross food and tacky service   total overhaul needed   great location   nothing else 
tyler   justin are literally the best servers ever  i really wont go to any other ihop location anymore  theyre awesome servers and are super quick about getting you your food   drinks  theyre super funny and nice 
ive been seeing dr  keller for 2 years  and i love going to my appointments  shes amazing  shes the perfect mixture of kind  intelligent  caring  funny and down to earth  ive never felt better  and ive never had a doctor go into so much detail on my labs  she does a full review of my hormone levels multiple times a year and keeps my emotionally and mentally balanced  i wish i could clone her  i just took my boyfriend in to see her today  and im so excited for whats in store for him   oh and by the way  her staff is amazing too  
i found my new seamstresses  i needed a dress altered in a hurry and these ladies were amazing  they were very pleasant and the work was perfect  and fast   im so grateful they fit me in and even helped me with a pair of shorts that i needed un cuffed  ill be back and i highly recommend you give them a try 
first time and will keep coming back  totally impressed by the entire staff  great food  clean environment and good atmosphere 
this place sucks  i was there on vacation and went to pick up my rental car  i gave them my credit card and they said it was declined  i asked the man behind the counter how much they were trying to charge me and it was almost  500 dollars  just to rent a car for 4 hrs  the price was ridiculous to begin with at  232 dollars for a one way rental to drive 4 hrs to west virgina  i told the guy i have the money on the card for the rental and a little over a hundred more for a  deposit  but charging me almost close to  500 was a little much  he did not care one bit  he told me to call my credit card company and see if they could up my limit    now mind you  im from california  flew all day and now stranded 4 hrs from my final destination and they could not have given a care in the world about it  told me to take a train or something  i have never had any experience like this in my life  rented a car on the way back for  132 bucks with budget  no deposit  thats how it should be  dont waste your time or money on these scammers   they dont care anyway 
dont get me wrong  i love me some sonic  but this is probably the worst location ive ever been to  in the dozen or so times ive visited this location  they have never gotten my order right  their speakers are often broken too  so ive had to pull into two or three different stalls before finding a working speaker  the foods good enough  the usual sonic fare  but i wouldnt call it fast  be sure to allow time to send your order back and have them fix it 
went for the first time yesterday with my wife  4 kids  1 niece  and 2 nephews   and we will definitely be back  i had the xanadew  which was amazing  we got drinks for everyone in our family and several cookies for around  20 which is way less than we were expecting   way less than we would normally pay for everyone to get their own treat  my daughter didnt love her first drink choice  but they were happy to make a different one for her that she loved   the environment is perfect for kids  we stayed for over an hour and could have stayed longer  we will definitely be back  and i look forward to making this a regular stop for our family  highly recommend 
our food was cold and the fries taste like were eating salt packs  1st and last time eating here 
a very nice environment for anyone to go get a haircut   all the barbers are very knowledgeable and will get you the right haircut your looking for  i at least go every week for my haircut   thank you guys for the good service and keep up the good work  
deon does an amazing job grooming my ragdoll cat  rudy   she has more knowledge than any groomer i have met and has helped me spot potential health issues with rudy  so i could get him to the veterinarian   not only does deon have a passion for what she does  but she truly loves animals  she has treated rudy like her own  mitch comes with her and loves animals too  i trust deon and mitch with rudy and all my cats 
our first time trying this lovely establishment  food was made fresh after we ordered and it was all delicious  i recommend the pierogi sampler for those of you unfamiliar with the dish  very polite and charming service  the food was prepared and brought to our table very quickly  we will be back with friends in tow 
the philippino food here is the best in town by far  all the dishes are great and the halo halo is sooo yummy  my wife cooks awesome philippino food so i am a tough critic  we will only come to one restaurant in phoenix for philippino food  that is halo halo kitchen 
service was good  the food may be the abosolue worst greek food i have ever had  the rice is soooo dry you there is no way possible to eat it  i ordered the chicken skewers portion was small one had chicken the other only peppers and onions  my wife order the greek trio some sort of combination plate horribly spiced  uneatable  do yourself a favor go to the in and out across the street  i wish i had  could have save 50 bucks  the 2 stars are for the service not the food 
food and service is absolutely top notch  great for business dinners or special occasions  i went to del friscos for a business dinner  now i have to take the wife back  pricey but worth it when you feel like splurging a bit 
always a great experience and been a customer for 6yrs  the staff and dr wang are helpful and informative explaining all my options  definitely a recommend to go see them
one spoonful of that cereal milk ice cream and i felt like i was in heaven  it was a bit on the pricey side  but if was definitely worth it  ill for sure be back when im in the area again 
overrated  food was mediocre  wait was long and even the famed frozen hot chocolate wasnt all that great and definitely not worth the price 
not a robot  just an avid fan of the food  everything is flavourful and its consistent  the owners are from t t  everyone knows they make the best rotis   i recommend to all my island friends with no complaints  so far 
meat was soft   tender  nice drink selection  and yummy desserts   there was a lot of children around so if youre looking for an adult night restaurant  this may not work for you 
im frustrated with aveda and havent even had a service yet  my hair  color appointment has been canceled twice    im contemplating cancelling my upcoming  twice rescheduled friday appointment since i dont have complete confidence that my apppointtment wont be cancelled for a 3rd time  im feeling very disappointed because i was so excited to recently move to phoenix and discover that there was a highly regarded aveda institute near me and so far  my experiences have been negative  on a positive note  the person that calls to cancel my appointments is very nice and apologetic 
checked this place out a few nights ago  since its spring break at asu  i imagine every bar on mill was nowhere near capacity  this place had a smallish  chill crowd with a relaxed vibe  i imagine when all the students get back  that could change  i thought the layout was nice  with a prominent bar smack in the center  ordering drinks was easy and the bartenders were laid back  id definately give this place another visit 
thank you again rose for a great groom on missy    as always kelly and her staff are the best    thank you all for your awesome care of missy  mike   colleen camp
friendly staff   tons of great ideas and products   i came here after a disappointing experience at archivers in the same mall   from now on  ill happily come here instead 
we tried this place for the first time today after reading the reviews on yelp and it did not disappoint  they were slammed when we walked in  but they were so friendly and attentive that the wait didnt seem as long    there were so many tantalizing options on the menu  but we decided on the huevos rancheros  chilaquiles and the bacon burger  i am a chilaquiles connoisseur and for not being a mexican restaurant  these were delicious  my family thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well    the attentiveness and service was great even though it did take a little more time than normal to get our food  it was definitely worth the wait    we will be back soon and we are happy to have found our new go to brunch spot   highly recommend  
if i could i would give this wendys 0 stars i went a couple days ago and it was 30 minutes before closing time  i ordered a double cheeseburger meal and my food was cold the fries were soggy as if they were old my meat was not cooked throughly and it was cold the drive thru worker was a dark skinned female there was a car behind us and her head set was beeping for her to take the other customers order and she said  youve got to be fucking kidding me  and i heard a guy inside in the kitchen yell something out as if all the workers just wanted to close already  i wasted my money with the poor service and poor food service  it was so disappointing and im beyond pissed that i wasted money on food that was old and not to mention not cooked throughly 
my ultimate favorite is the waffles but i tried the sage fried chicken and loved it   everything i have had was cooked to perfection 
ok  so the family decides to eat locally at the resort they are staying at   america was the choice  i had the steak and eggs which was ok  i made it clear that i need my steak well done which was far from that  i ate the edges and corners and gave the rest of it to hubby  duuuuude i made it clear i am prego and cannot have raw meat      really  u serve it bloody     hubby got the club sandwich which was good   its kinda hard to f up a club sandwich  would not come back cause they had ok food and really bad service
get ready to wait in line for a few minutes on a sat night  very new york style   loved the pizza   specialy the all cheese pizza  it was delicious    if you love thin crust  you will appreciate this pizza   my husband and i are a fan of this place and we are looking forward to having it again everytime we are in vegas   reasonable price  ps  i cant believe the location    no marketing no signs   its a whole in a wall place in a really nice hotel      its cosmos best kept secret 
i should have known when we walked in and there were only 3 other tables dining     the service was snobby and horrible   the server acted like she was too good to be serving us and we only saw her when she took our order and brought us our bill   the food was completely overpriced for the quantity or quality   my scallops were  42  i think there were a total of 2 scallops   come on  i grew up working in the restaurant industry so talk about ripoff   we ordered the chocolate souffle at the beginning of dinner as instructed so we wouldnt have to wait  but we still did  an additional 20 minutes for dessert   even though i would have ordered more wine our server was too busy to be bothered so i didnt   bad  bad  bad       next time ill take my  250 and dine anywhere else in vegas and probably get better food and service than at this joint 
great spot  awesome show  great vip service  would do this every time i am in vegas  much different than anything i have seen before  wow  good good good 
came here for dinner today   tuesday   the service was great  very attentive  and quick  the tacos were delicious  the handmade tortillas really add to the taste  we tried just about every taco on the menu  the ones that really stood out were the puerco verde taco  adobada taco  al pastor and crunchy taco  these were absolutely amazing  we did not enjoy the carne asada taco or shrimp taco as much as the others  but they were okay   the chips and salsa were fresh  all around great food  keep it up 
albert provided excellent customer service  but more importantly fantastic results  i was very pleased with his professionalism   returning phone calls promptly  providing updates on time estimates and when he would arrive  how long it would take  and answering any questions i had before he detailed my muddy jeep wrangler  his business is unique in that he requires nothing from his customers other than their vehicle   his truck has his own water  power  and all supplies imaginable  he is truly a mobile detailer in the purest sense  i look forward to having him detail my vehicle again in the future  made it look like it just rolled off the sales floor 
what a great restaurant  it has lots of conversational pieces on the walls without being really tacky  the building has a ton of history and its really interesting  the waitresses are always super sweet  ive never had one that wasnt funny and nice and very attentive    my family comes here for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  its rare that a restaurant has great food in all three categories     the only problem i have is that every single time i ask for something without cheese   it comes with cheese anyways  im not one for sending food back so then im forced to take medicine and bear a stomachache  bill johnsons just really wants me to endure dairy i guess 
this dog park is simple enough  its small and convenient but it has two things that will ruin any good dog park   1  its very close to a playground  kids love to come in and play with  or even pick up  random peoples dogs  which is not okay  it creates such a hostile environment and makes all the owners nervous    2  people who have no idea what dog park etiquette is  every time i come here i experience at least one owner who doesnt watch their dog  doesnt pick up their dogs waste  or gets mad at someone elses dog when clearly its their dog causing the problem  also those owners who hover over their dog and push any other dog trying to sniff or play with them away    my dogs love this park but i wont bring them here because im always terrified of what kind of situation might happen with the inevitable kids and stupid pet owners 
gross  i ordered the pizza pocket appetizer it took 30 minutes and it was burnt  servers are way to jumpy and they seem like that want you to leave as fast as possible   she brought my check before my food even came out and the place was completely dead 
i checked this spot out earlier this month and definitely said i would be back seeing the full bar wasnt opened yet  my second trip was well worth coming back for  this place is massive folks  the host could have been a little more friendlier but i went straight to the bar anyways  i am not sure where they found their bartender mich but she is utterly breath taking and definitely made my second trip worth while  very personable  food came out super quick  she was running circles around some of the other staff  ive had friends say service is hit or miss here but i cant complain    i will be back to try the infamous shrimp and grits for sure as well as the scenery behind their bar 
for me customer service is always something i look in whenever i go eat somewhere  not only was the food to die for but the service was amazing  i had the lobster mac and cheese and it was very well made  the lobster was tender and the mac and cheese very creamy  i definitely will be returning  
excellent menu and authentic french cuisine  true bistro style  superb wine list  amazing desserts  and all of the food is a 1  great patio to people watch 
amazing  ive been here twice and tried the saigon chicken  the grilled pork wreck bahn mi and the good morning vietnam  the bahn mi is simple  but it leaves the meat and vegetables being the highlights of the sandwich  which is exactly how i like it    the meat is grilled very nicely  the bahn mi is topped with some very well prepared vegetables including cucumbers and radishes  and the bread is fresh and delicious  with just the perfect amount of crisp  simple and inexpensive  the good morning vietnam is pretty much an omelet bahn mi  but with butter and and a couple dashes of soya sauce which i think compliments it perfectly  its extremely affordable and delicious  and only available at breakfast  so definitely give it a go when you can   the owner is really nice and friendly to talk to  he also gave my friend and i some meatballs to try  and they were juicy and delicious  i tried half of my friends pork bahn mi and really liked it as well    i recommend to get the food  for here  so theres more room for vegetables  i personally like bs bahn mi better than bahn mi boys  because i can focus on the meat and fresh uncooked vegetables 
well hello newly revamped vi   very cute and modern  it moved it from 3 5 to 4 stars for that reason  i am not a person who is a fan of chains  more of a ma and pop type girl myself but when its done right  ive gotta give credit where its due  so i grabbed easter brunch here because the other places i wanted to try was closed   i had the healthy banana stuffed  strawberry topped whole grain pancakes  very good  i didnt need butter or syrup which is considered a victory in my book  my family had this and thats which they enjoyed as well  my cousin had a skillet which looked much better than what i had experienced at crackers and co the day before  my biggest complaints have to be the fact that they use minute maid oj and the coffee was awful     seriously could have been the worst coffee i ever tried to choke down   but mmmm those pancakes  the server was friendly as well which made things better 
from the time we ordered to the time the food was placed at our table was 30 mins  then when our food arrived it was cold  all 5 of us had cold food  it was terrible  you can tell the potatoes werent even cooked long enough  they were soggy and cold  ive eaten here many times  this was the least busy and the worst experience  maybe its not busy because they are starting to make so many errors  id recommend a dozen other restaurants over here any day now 
for starters this place does not map properly on google or anything else even though the address is correct  its actually located off the 202 san tan at power and ray rd on the east side of the rd from wal mart  the atmosphere was very nice  i really liked the tables and dishes  the miso soup was very good and cheap as well  the prices on everything were very reasonable  there are several sushi restaurants along power and i definitely believe that this was one of the better ones  unfortunately thats not saying too much   the rolls were pretty good  a bite or 2 of the uni on the jade roll tasted a bit suspect but overall the jade roll was good  the avocado and creme cheese gave it a smooth texture   the super albacore roll was nicely seared on the outside  the tiger roll was a bit spicy for my weak taste buds but had good flavor 
loved this quaint little breakfast spot   we went on a monday morning  but i can imagine this place is pretty busy on weekends   great service and prices and the food was very good   would definitely go back 
i went there today for a growth  infection on my leg   keesha tended to my problem   this is the first i learned that she is a pa and not a doctor   anyway she said they were going to call in 2 prescriptions for me  well i called my drugstore at 6 30 when i left work and no one called in any prescriptions for me  i now have to suffer through the night without my prescriptions  keesha however did a good job it was a member of her staff who was to call in the prescriptions not she herself
i love greekfest   its the best greek food that i have tasted in phoenix   everything was very flavorful  great portions for the price   i will be back 
very quick  easy  courteous check in  from the outside this is a large marriott property and my expectations were set too high   as a silver member i was offered a king room on a high floor and all i can say is i cant get past the smell  the moment the elevator doors opened to the 10th floor    the old  musty carpet smell takes over  the room itself was stifling  with the thermostat pre set to 75 along with the musty carpet makes for a horrible combination  close to the airport and nice that it has a shuttle  but choose a newer property if you can help it 
the service is horrible at this location   when they first open i was excited because it was a location close to my house  but have been disappointed in the lack of service   i went into the location last yesterday and sat at the bar   it took a while for the server to come over and when i ordered she proceeded to go to the next table vs calling in my order to the cook   she then calls in this large group order vs my single order   as i see the cook making the food thinking my order was in there 15 minutes later she comes confirm what i ordered   whats the point of writing it down if you are going to ask me again  i just cancelled the order and came home to make my own breakfast   the consistent thing about this location is bad service 
wow   is it just us or has the quality of the food  and service  gone downhill  it took a good 10mins for our waiter to provide us drinks which is forever in buffet terms  and the food selections were just ok as compared to my previous five star review  i was fully expecting another great experience but sadly we wont go out of our way to come here again  too bad 
oh right  this used to be sea blue  we really enjoyed pub 1842 and would definitely consider going back the next time were in vegas  they offer a nice selection of beers  the burgers were delicious  and the fried pickles were an interesting appetizer  service was friendly enough and they have a bunch of tvs which suited me just fine  my only nitpick were that the fries were lukewarm  but everything else was really good  my wife now wants to check out other michael mina establishments so i guess she enjoyed her meal as well 
im such a frequent snoozer  ive experienced a lot of really cool waiters  waitresses  i had olivia today and she was literally the best  she was working with a great amount of people  i came in on a saturday at 10am   30 minute but its a weekend  anyway  our waitress olivia was super nice  multitask very awesome and brought our drinks and food in a timely manner  always very happy at this location out of all the snooze in phx 
amazing   great work and this was my first time waling in and i got a gel mani and monday thru thursday they run a special of  22 gel mani  and that included a mini massage    get out of here   amazing   ill be back again for sure  it was a great experience
i felt extremely happy with my purchase  upgrade  i  worked with charlie gomez  he greeted me immediately and helped me right away    although i knew what phone i wanted charlie really took the time with me  he saw my current plan and changed it for the better keeping it at the same price  he was very knowledgeable on prices and was able to really explain to me what kind of charges i would be seeing on my next bill   he also took the time to help me sync all my information to my new phone which took much longer than expected  in that time charlie was super patient with how long that was taking  i was in the store 15mins after close   during this time he explained the benefit of trading in my old phone for a tablet which i ended up taking one home  i felt extremely comfortable and confident in every decision i made  charlie even took time to really build the relationship with me as the customer asking questions about me and not making it seem like i was just another transaction  really pleased with my experience with charlie and verizon   hes a great asset to the team  
very happy with our new fence  they were great to work with   installed it very fast  gave us the best price in town to boot  highly recommended 
mark will make your clothes fit you like a glove  very professional and goes out of his way to get the job done 
this is my new favorite place for philly cheese steak and pizza and wings and burgers and buffalo chicken fries  everything i tasted was delicious   we will be back   the owners are wonderful   they came out to talk to us several times to make sure everything was as we expected   i noticed they treated everyone the same   customer service is above normal standards here   you dont get treated the same at bigger establishments 
saw this place while i was picking up pizza for my kids   i didnt want pizza thought i would go in and give the tamales a try   i havent regretted that decision at all   the chicken tamales are the best   they are super spicy  the way i like   the beef with red sauce is great too  not very spicy at all   the masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully   i am hooked on these tamales 
wow  the worst service i have ever experienced in my entire life  when i arrived there were maybe 5 people sitting at the bar and nobody at the tables  after some time waiter d came out and took my order  two eggs over easy  sausage  english muffin and a coke   then she took another mans order that came in after me  a lady comes in sits near me and a man takes her order  pretty soon my waiter comes out with my order  bangers and a coffee  not  she tries to give it to the lady near me who tells her no i didnt order that from you  she comes back to take my order again  mean while the man gets his food  eats it and leaves  the lady gets her food  another man who came in after me  pays for his coffee  cancels his order and leaves  out comes my order again  scrambled eggs  sausage and muffin  not  the lady that came in after me pays and leaves  finally out comes my eggs on a platter with nothing else  un frickin believable 
visited on wednesday night that turned out to be a concert on the square night   parking was a bit of a hassle   we  mrs    mr   used a bucky book coupon that advised us to call and make a reservation   we made one for 7 30   we arrived on time and the place was nearly empty   the hostess just seated us without asking if we had a reservation   there was really no need for one as there was plenty of empty tables    we chose a booth over a table and discovered the booth was very tight to get into and out of   the benches are too close to the table and the table support leg is very wide making it difficult to slide in  get out of your seat   not a big deal  but if youre older like us  you would be best advised to pick a table   our server was kind in greeting us  but did not ask if we wanted any drinks until her second visit   no big deal  but we both commented that we usually get asked that question when we are first seated   we just had water with our meals   we ordered two pasta dishes per bucky book coupon plus an appetizer   appetizer was the mozzarella  garlic bread which was very good  but it took forever to get it   our server apologized 3 times  we did not inquire  rather she offered the apologies on her own  and the final time she said itll be out in 2 minutes   it took 5   we heard anther waitress apologize to another table about their long wait too   service was friendly but slow   our meals were very late in arriving   mrs  had the the ravioli with the creamy tomato sauce with spinach and mushrooms   mr  had the manicotti   i will say that we both had made our mind that we would not be returning to this restaurant because of the very slow service  however our meals were really good plus we got a very nice discount  bogo  on our pasta meals   we might go back with a coupon 
cool place for happy hour and to sling a few brews with your pooch in tow  its friendly enough  sometimes the wait can be pretty long so be prepared for that   ive never had any real issues with the service or staff like is mentioned in other reviews  and ive been numerous times    i think the food is pretty good  they have lots of options  and the beer list is huge  i like it there and have met lots of interesting people there as well  sometimes the crowd can tend to be a little trendy  uppity so i guess that explains some of the bad reviews   i like it 
the good  the bad  and the ok      on our way to see a spring training game at maryvale stadium  we decided to check this place out after reading some reviews and rather than pay  10 bucks for a burger we thought it was a good idea  the reviews were mostly good and the prices listed online seemed reasonable  we thought to get burritos  id decided before we left the house   the menu online had prices from  5 75  6 25  they do not have a working website  so what i found turned out to be dated information  what it turned out to cost  you might ask    two burritos for  20 bucks  well   19 bucks  so that was a bit of a surprise  parking is tricky and the back lot is in rough shape  but it was packed so that seemed a good sign   if taking to go i recommend calling ahead to avoid a wait  which wasnt long however  the place was packed  mostly with families  another good sign   the service was prompt and friendly   my gf had the pierna  and i got the bistec  large and heavy burrito and goodies that came on the side included shredded lettuce  cucumber  radish  a roasted jalapeno  roasted onion slices  lime wedge and salsa  good value still but more pricey than i expected so really nothing to complain about   i didnt try the pierna but my girl enjoyed it  i mostly enjoyed mine except for one major drawback  nearly half of the steak in my burrito was grisel  fat and connective tissue    so that was not a gratifying experience  whomever trimmed the steak did a poor job  that said it was very flavorful and filling   i would return but try another item   
the pink cupcake has made my daughters birthday cakes for 3 years now and i would never go anywhere else   if you want exceptional taste and quality work  you must try the pink cupcake lv  
disappointing  poor and very slow service  not traditional mexican food at all  generic food for those with bar food taste  margaritas certainly not worth the hype  live near in peters and were hoping for more 
i dont know how else to word this  this shit is nasty      first meal i had all day so almost anything would have tasted good   i ordered the duck  i even asked the people working their if it was any good  they said yes  very good      first it came in a card board to go box and nothing on the bottom to stop wetness from coming through the card board  second it had a horrible smell like old garbage  but since i just spent about 34  on a meal the size of an appetizer i figured i might as well try it   third the duck was barely even warm  more like room temperature and it wouldnt chew  it was so chewy had to be spit out and was about impossible to eat   tasted like unseasoned pig feet   forth it had some sort of peach medly under the duck that was cold like it just came out the refrigerator   the peaches and what ever else that mess was looked cooked but were very cold with no flavor to them     most disgusting meal i think ive ever tried   i dont see how this establishment will stay in business or how they managed to have such good reviews    tried 3 bites to much  thank god outbacks open till 10
my husband and i were looking for something fun to do after dinner  the tables  sticks  and balls were all in good shape  the music was good  beer was priced alright  the lady running the place was very friendly  and we had a good time with the people playing at the tables around us  only downside was that it could get pretty smoky at times  but we had a good time so we didnt care  well definitely be back 
my new favorite place  if only i knew about it when i went to school here     such an amazing vibe  american mixed w cocktails  what could go wrong  they were crowded but so attentive   we found seats right away     were helped by every available bartender   manager   etc  such a great  great experience  
if you think you partners fine grab him where the sun dont shine  clap you hands and stomp you feet move you buns on down to charlies  its sweet    hey at least there is a consistant crowd at charlies  unlike many of the other gay bars in phx  so they are doing something right  they have great drink specials and its right off the light rail  dont forget to grab some tasty mexican food from outback by the vollayball court  its delish 
my favorite item is the blackberry bran muffin  its amazing  weekends it can be fierce  parking  waiting in line  and then on top of that seating is like musical chairs  but other then that its definately worth it  wish i lived closer because i would be there everyday 
ive had the opportunity to visit this first watch a couple of times now and have found a couple of things  the good news     the service over the past visits has been consistently good  from the host  hostess to the waiter  waitress  all staff are friendly and accommodating  the bad news     ive also found that when the operation is extremely busy  the stress of the volume drives the quality of the food down  for example  today our egg dishes were a bit off and the potatoes under cooked  also  the silverware was dirty  if the get this issue straightened out  i will re write the review and up the stars 
i am passing through town and staying with a family member for the holidays  us travelers  tired of holiday food  craving pizza  call two hippies for a brushetta  a marghertia type pizza  yay  yum  no meat  just cheese  tomatoes  basil  onions   yum    im looking at it right now  there are a couple measly strings of basil on a pizza with tons of red onions and half ripe beefsteak tomatoes  lazy take on an easy  classic pizza  basil is the third ingredient on the description  and is the least present  disappointed  i had heard such good things    boooooooo  i hope they improve  for locals sake  the delivery was prompt  however  and the driver friendly  but im not trying to eat them   we also ordered the spinach salad to share we dont eat meat anymore  and thought this would be a safe bet  wrong  covered in bacon  with a hardboiled egg  it doesnt even say anything about the ingredients of the salads on the menu  which would lead one to assume that they are relatively plain  which would have been fine with us    what is not fine  is when we call them back  embarrassed for us and for them  to ask for our money back  we simply cannot eat the food the pizza is not to our liking and the salad is something we simply cannot eat  the man on the phone is rude  near yelling  or maybe he just speaks very loudly and abrasively    and tells us to never order from him again  which even if we lived here we would not repeat  what with the food not being what we like    listen  i have worked in service industry and understand that holiday times are extra stressful for the workers  but that never excuses staff being flat out rude and dismissive of customers  if i had ever done that  it would be an immediate fire 
we had a huge celebratory dinner here during charlotte restaurant week in 2015  so when we returned for a wedding last weekend  mimosa was on our must eat list  this time we went for brunch and i was just as impressed as i was for dinner  the shrimp and grits  banana muffins  and house salad were all great  the only food item that could have been improved upon was the boiled shrimp  and because im new orleans  i think i expect more from everyone because new orleans has the best seafood lol  overall  i enjoyed brunch and a few belinis  yall should consider a bottomless option  
they have trivia night  jackpot  great organic coffee and awesome atmosphere  patio is awesome they keep it cool with their plethora of misters but wet 
ate here with the family  its definitely a higher quality buffet than the rest  ill have to try the one in the cosmopolitan  the crab legs were    mehhhh    had better at a cheap chinese buffet  the rest of the dishes were very good  my wife liked them too considering that shes a finicky eater  the kids loved all the candy  well be back 
my first impression was   id be back in vegas just for their bacon wrapped dates with toasted almonds and blue cheese    heres a second review of firefly after being there just a week ago and trying some more tapas plates with my friends  we first ordered a pitcher of red sangria for the table since it was happy hour  1  2 price on all drinks  and of course  what goes better with spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine  our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just  14 00  it came in a pretty tall pitcher  well chilled  and with chopped apples inside for presentation    chorizo clams  peppers  2 kinds of spicy sausage  white wine  parmesan toasts  the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious   steamed mussles  red curry  white wine and coconut cream  the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish  it was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles   stuffed dates  bacon wrapped  smoked almond  red wine reduction  blue cheese  must try must try must try  too out of this world   stuffed peppers  spanish piquillo peppers  fresh mozzarella  garlic cream cheese  tomato sauce  the combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish  but the sauce wasnt too impressive  id say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates  but good if you love your tomatoes and cheese  pasta sauce taste   mushroom tart  puff pastry  boursin cheese  simply good   the lasting impression   check out the photos  youll be sold  its a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends  its a nice breather off the strip in lv 
bouchon bakery is located conveniently outside of the venetian elevators so it was the first spot i headed to after checking in   i am constantly on the hunt for the perfect authentic macaron  and bouchon offered me just that  they are crispy on the outside  and soft  chewy  and full of flavor on the inside   just how i like them  they were so delicious i had to go back for seconds  and this time i took advantage of their buy 5 get the 6th free deal     i highly recommend bouchon bakery if you are a macaron snob like myself and appreciate an authentic french pastry 
yes i am a fan but i do have one major criticism  the prime rib is wayyyyyy under cooked  it is very raw in the middle and i will only eat it if i can get an end piece  the sausage is wonderfully rich  the mimosas are delishious  and the eggs benedict table is great with all the different ways you can order it 
we were welcomed by all the staff   the food was good   we only had to wait a few minutes for the fresh food to come out   it was kind of slow service but that could have been because the people in front of us  
the food was just ok but over priced  the service or the lack there of was enough for us to never go back   it is clear that its management has zero knowledge and experience in customer service 
great place to go  good lunch deals  great wings and subs  and the pizza is some of the best on this side of the valley  also  staff couldnt have been better or kept the place cleaner 
great prices  great service  and clean environment  there isnt much by the way of options  but if you frequently get the munchies for tacos like myself this is the most solid option on the west side  and the late hours definitely steal a lot of business from other businesses near by  give them a try 
went in for the lunch buffet with a groupon   very good food  great source and excellent service   will definitely be back 
great service  great view    apps were tasty  ordered mild and my stomach was burning from the inside out   dont know if it was me or the food   haha  would definitely go back 
rented a uhaul from them yesterday  last minute  had the best customer service experience   i would go out of my way to rent from them again and if i ever need a storage unit in that area  theyll be hearing from me   i would highly recommend them to anyone 
got the teriyaki burger with everything   it was very good and fresh   for me personally  i think it is comparable to 5 guys or shake shack   i will definitely eat here again  i think the best thing about this place is the customer service   extremely pleasant 
wow  what a great burger joint  ive only had the pleasure of trying it once and ordering takeout since the wait is ridiculously long  but 4 5 stars  ordered the burger bar sliders so that we could try three different burgers  one was angus  pretty good  very basic  a little dab of mayo and mustard and its perfect  the next was the bacon burger which was my least favorite out of the three because the patty was a bit dry and not as flavorful  the last was the onion burger and i think this is the reason that makes burger bar so popular  the patty was so tender and moist  one bite into it and it was oozing with juices  the caramelized onions enhances the rich flavor of the beef  my mouth probably said oh em gee  if you get the chance  order it with sweet potato fries to top it off 
my favorite sushi place in all of las vegas  when i visit the city  i make sure to make a stop here  the sashimi is really fresh  i even remembered the sushi chef saying that some of it comes from japan  toro has to be my favorite sashami there  tastes like butter and melts in your mouth  i think ive tried just about everything there and all of it really stands out and makes me dream about coming back 
christie was such a good realtor to have on our side  she was on top of things with scheduling showings of our home we were in  walked us through everything  and helped guide us with feedback  selling our home was a smooth process that couldnt have gone better   we also purchased our new home with her  the sellers and their realtor were difficult in every way possible  she was assertive and fought to get what we deserved while remaining professional  it was a difficult purchase  but christie got us what we wanted and we couldnt love our home more  definitely hire her 
hand trimmed prime cut prime rib at under 16 00 is the best hidden gem dollar for dollar steakhouse in las vegas  the bone in cowboy cut is under 23 00  all prime ribs come with great bread and a house salad made to order to at your table 
extremely unprofessional  two of the workers  a woman who was setting the schedule and a man  who is a manager of some of the branch  were arguing extremely loudly about the mans schedule  it went on the whole time we were there  the man was gesturing angrily at the woman 
decent food but poor guest service upon my first visit  not a very welcoming atmosphere  waitresses need to brighten up    
been coming here from ca for a couple years now  theres a bartender here  his name is brad    tip him big  he is amazing  so upbeat  knowledgable and helpful 
wanted to do another laminate flooring project in the house we just moved to  wanted to explore products other than than what lowes or home depot carry  found exactly what we were looking for at a great price  great service and technical assistance thru justin was a bonus  highly recommend them 
we are very glad we found this place  sandra was very helpful in setting up our reservation and juan was so helpful when we moved in  they were both very good to explain all the options and rules 
used to go to the location in north phoenix and greenway and 7th street  lovely restuarant  great food  always our choice for breakfast  went to this one a couple of years ago and will never go back  small  cramped  the corned beef hash  which used to be my favorite  was terrible  and staff was rude  not a fancy location by a motel 6  but a lot of  scottsdale attitude  being tossed around  very  very disappointing 
family owned  great clean mexican food thats as close to homemade as it gets  super tiny  old building  nothing fancy  just great food  great service    just found out they do breakfast too    get the chile relleno  actually  get 3 
sandwiches at this location are consistently awesome  a bit pricey  but you get what you pay for  there is no bad sandwich in the place  just ask yourself if you want a hot sandwich or a cold one  big one or a small one  then look at the ingredients and pick one  this one does not have soup  a couple locations do  cookies are okay  chips are chips  drinks are drinks  this place is sandwich focused  a large cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers  onions  mushroom  mayo lettuce and tomato is the best thing in the place    by the way  its actually two full meals in a bun  unless youre a fatty like me   service is good  people are helpful and friendly  call ahead  place your order  then you dont have to wait 
as long as you get there at least an hour before closing  the foods consistently fresh  ive seen people have a fresh order made if youre extra picky too  nice cheap fast chinese food  not much else to it 
great experience  ive been to vegas several times and staying at the flamingo exceeded my expectations  right in the middle of everything   clean  and the staff was very friendly  all the rooms  but the suites have been updated    do not be discouraged by the other reviews  stayed here for a great deal and my family visiting from central america really enjoyed it 
this review if for the casita  residence club   if you dont own  dont go there  they have two sets of standards and will not accommodate any requests from non owners  you may also end up in casita 44 next to the busy road  other staff seem to be quite friendly  you could have qute a pleasant experience there 
really great korean bbq place  definitelly coming back service was quick   helpful   they answered our questions   ji hoon was a great waiter   very impressive selection of side dishes   the meat definitely was savory 
last month i decided to go back to acrylics after a 30 year hiatus   mindy gave me a full set of acrylics with gel polish   i was going out of town for 3 weeks over christmas and she said that they would last for a month   i couldnt believe it  the acrylic didnt lift at all  i got compliments on my nails the entire 4 weeks   my only problem is the way they look when you go that long between fills   there is too much of my naked nail the shows 
i bought a 2007 passat wagon from carmax in henderson 2 years ago  the car had issues from day 1  i tried to take it back the first day after my mechanic looked at it  carmax said they would fix any issues and if i wasnt satisfied they would allow me the 5 day refund and return  this is a lie  the car had an oil leak  vacuum and turbo issues and countless other issues  recalls from vw that were not small  when i tried to return it they said they would not allow a refund  on the 5th day when they had it in their service dept for 4 days  and they said i had to pick out a car on the lot in henderson and they would not refund or get a car from another location  they do this for new customers  but not for me when i put 5k down on the lemon    buyer beware  lemons for sale and a return policy that is a lie  also  i am not in deep with a complete front engine repair 
great place  we shop here regularly  the  even the ready made stuff is great   im a fan of the chicken snitzel and the rice stuffed chicken breast   like the tardis  this store is bigger on the inside  great fresh meat selection daily  well stocked before passover  and the staff is very helpful  you can call ahead for big orders and just pick them up 
went to this restaurant this morning arriving at 633am  sign on the door says they open at 6am   everything locked up  no one answered the phone   as i was leaving  a worker walked up from the leaking lot and apologized   she had been there since 530a waiting but still no manager to open up   ridiculous   so i ended up at waffle house 
only problem i have is going through drive thru they screw up my order  i like to order steak and chorizo burro  but get instead a steak   egg burro 
im not a customer here but i was waiting outside of the parking lot for 15 min and saw two customers take their dog out of this establishment and poop and not clean up after them on the gravel next to the side walk  not sure if this is normal practice here but perhaps this place should let their customers know that this practice is rude and foul  i even mentioned to one of the people that they left their dogs doo doo out here and she didnt even flutter and eyelid  oh well one star for the disappointing behavior 
the owners could not be any nicer  they are so knowledgeable and have always been straight forward  letting me know when it is wise to upgrade and when it would be a waste  to the point where i almost feel guilty for getting such good and cheap advice  i want to hug them every time i go in because it feels like such a welcome environment  weird but true 
    out of business      this place was so good  the interior is cozy and the service was excellent  we started with the artichoke and pita appetizer  and it was delicious  the bread that came with the meal was a definite highlight and tasted fresh  i had the pasta with vegetables and my picky friend had the pork  and we both were members of the clean plate club  the entrees come with a salad so it is more than enough food   the place is new  so there were a couple of kinks  white wine in a red wine glass  lights could be a bit dimmer  but the staff was kind and accommodating  i will definitely be back again 
good music  young hip crowd  good selection of beer and cocktails  if you want to be seen or see this is the place to be  where else do you have a dj playing a mix of music while the games are on  food is rich and the help is very friendly
walking in  there is a distinct dairy smell but im pretty sure it was explainable since it is an ice cream place   the staff was pretty friendly and the line was fairly short for an afternoon on a weekday   it was definitely an experience seeing how the ice cream is made  the pricing was okay  it wasnt too bad  we were just a little confused when my friend and i ordered the same thing but got different pricings  but its okay  it was probably a misunderstanding of some sort  we got tiramisu ice cream with kit kat toppings and it was delicious   definitely recommend trying this at least once just for experience 
been interested in trying this place for a while  given the gluten free options   especially fish and chips  finally ate lunch there and it was quiet with only a half dozen customers at the peak  sat on the patio and requested to sit in the shade because of hot summer sun and 30 degree heat  was seated at a table half in the sun and after overheating  requested to move to one of the 3 other empty tables actually in the shade but was told those tables are reserved for parties of 3   all were vacant   but reserved for theoretical customers of the future  so had to move the table periodically during the meal and sit on the edge of the chair to prevent from burning  fish was mediocre  fries were good  coleslaw was limp and flavourless  yesterdays    the restrooms provided a smell adventure usually restricted to rows of port a potties at death metal concerts  the highlight in terms of borderline sub health code cleanliness  was when the chicken delivery guy rolled up  literally  with a wire shopping cart  as he tried to remove the cardboard box within  about 2lbs of raw chicken wings fell onto the concrete in front of the entrance to the restaurant  they were able to pick up the spill minutes later  but hardly food handling to instil confidence in your meal  very disappointed 
security guard was completely rude and kept commenting on my physical stature     will not be coming back
ask for ozzy  he was the most amazing server  came in his first week for us everything we needed and definitely worth your money and time if you need to wait  we waited a lil over an hour  thanks ozzy   
nice little spot with delicious food  the chef is a really nice guy that comes out to talk to the tables  chef rudy you the man      
had the vehicle that i was interested in looked at by a mechanic and found it had some bad body work and some other minor issues  they were super friendly at first and then when i brought up the issues the salesman john was unwilling to negotiate the price and abruptly ended the conversation  would not ever go back there
this is my favorite burrito place  sooooo many more options than chipotle  from taco meat  to queso  to crushed chips  pineapple and more  and their sauces  amazing  they add so much to the actual burrito  i go with hothead sauce  tangy garlic  and sweet habanero  oh and their cookies i swear are baked with crack  soft  sweet  delicious  and you cant eat just one 
our server jarrett was literally amazing i suggest if you want to go here ask for him he will make your buca di beppo experience worth while  me and my family never stoped smiling
this is certainly the best shop in scottsdale for all of your pets needs   i love everything and everyone at this shop    megan   the chief cook and bottle washer   always brings a smile to anyone who enters  she is educated in the products the store sells and shows sincere and loving interest in yourself and your pet  i use sherry as a groomer and she never fails to uphold my high standards   she goes beyond being a professional   she is punctual and very caring for you and your pet    for myself and my  monkey   there is no where else  
rich at biltmore plumbing was referred to me by an old friend  he has worked on various plumbing issues ive had with my home over the last few years  rich always responds very quickly when i call  he is professional  punctual  honest  and he doesnt over charge  even when you have an emergency   i recommend rich at biltmore plumbing for all of your plumbing needs 
ive written in to chipotle twice already  this place just cant seem to keep up with the brand 
absolutely awful  doesnt know how to fix cars  always puts a band aid over it so youll have to come back and spend more money  never go here  youll regret it and so will your car and wallet 
awesome food   awesome service   owner is a wonderful friendly guy who is always around as well   as previously being a server  i appreciate this  it really shows a lot 
it was a saturday afternoon and we needed some good tasty grub  we came across the omni centre saw the playfair  ahh a good ol wetherspoons  you know what youre gonna get with them    it was a bit smaller than the usual wetherspoons i had been in  it was quite busy but we managed to find a seat for all 7 of us  we decided what each of us were having with some getting some good deals on burgers and drinks saving us some money   our food didnt take long to arrive and was good  thats one thing about wetherspoons  its the same wherever you go  especially if your wanting something quick and decent  it did the trick and saved us a bit of money 
well  well  well  we meet at last  ive heard so much  so show me a good time  oh yeah   ive had krispy kreme doughnuts previously down in bath and bristol  so  i knew i would treated to the max and the choices would be good but how good is edinburgh    i have heard about the 24 hour drive thru and all about the queues  angela b  and i decided to go here for part of my birthday day out in edinburgh  she did also have special orders from her mr to get many doughnuts to go  or else  no argument there   it has been opened for a quite a while now  so it was a pleasant  non busy  non queuing experience  we enjoyed watching the doughnut theatre in full action and taking lots of photos in the process    we made our way up to the counter and i needed sugar fast as i was flagging  lots of birthday excitement  and i was still to drive back to glasgow  i ordered a strawberries and cream  i like doughnut with a filling best  along with a mocha and cream  sugar rush    yas  i ordered separately 3 doughnuts to take away  an original glazed  another strawberries and cream and a glazed raspberry filled doughnut  delicious    as we had came into a hotlight store  angela had good knowledge here  it meant it had a hotlight happy hour and it at the exact time we arrived  between 7 00pm   8 00pm  ya dancer  this meant we were treated to a free original glazed doughnut  hot off the line  oh man  it was like biting into fluffy sugary clouds  it was amazing  i think i may have boarded on delirious  please note they dont automatically do this  we had to ask and then double check with another staff member we were getting the doughnuts  so ask   edinburgh you have proved to be worthy and i would more than happily go back  so with our krispy kreme hats  balloons  doughnuts to go and a faces so high on sugar  we skipped merrily on our way 
wish i found this place sooner than later  great staff and service  lets not forget about the food  there was a party in my tummy and it was a good party  
i stayed at sams for 2 nights  the room was very clean  i was comped  20 towards food  lots of security people  you need your room pass to get on the elevator  the snack bar at the sports book is excellent 
power outlets and usb outlets everywhere  what else does a traveler on a layover need 
the atmosphere and customer service was great  i ordered the keg burger and it was decent  didnt blow me away  the best part of the dinner was the fresh baked bread 
i went to dannys this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and i paid for a vip car wash    after picking up my car i was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor   i later noticed that money i had in my car for parking was missing   im highly upset that i paid for these services  tipped the staff  and had my property stolen   ive been going to dannys on and off for years as they are close to my home but i will never frequent their establishment again 
we love this place   great ambiance  wine  and staff   cory  the owner  makes us feel special whenever we go there   i highly recommend this place 
the service was okay  but i was very disappointed that the gift card i recd   as a gift from a co worker   wasnt allowed to be used for the day spa package  so what i thought was going to be a wonderful relaxing day  had me leaving with a bad taste in my mouth and very stressed out  needless to say  i wont be back and honestly due to this policy  i wouldnt recommend you go there 
i had my appointment yesterday at lash studios in ahwatukee for the very first time ever getting professional lash extensions  for the most part everything went great  the girl who did my lashes was nice and easy going  the only thing i could say that i didnt like was it def wasnt what i expected at the end and i noticed my left eye has way more lashes than the right eye  and i did let her know that before i left but she insisted that they  to her  looked even  the more i look at them in the mirror the more i notice the unevenness  besides that i like them  would i get them again  not sure its worth the money  i think the temporary lashes you could put on and take off the same day look better 
i eat at the 7th ave location weekly for lunch   7 for two slices and a drink  cant beat it  i go through the express line and then watch sports on the two big screens  tawnya  the bar tender  even remembers what kind of soda i drink  this place is great  food is great  service is great  quick and easy  highly recommend it 
not bad for a random pho joint inside treasure island  i know this place has been here for years because ive seen many ads for this restaurant  years before my first visit here   its a restaurant on the strip  you have to expect an expensive meal  pho was  14    that is definitely almost three times what i would normally pay for a bowl in seattles international district  but hey  if youre hungover and craving pho  why the hell not   service was really quick and friendly  the only downside was that our server was in some kind of rush to grab the signed checks back    it was a lot of pressure and unnecessary  she was literally next to my friend waiting and watching him as he decided how much to tip her  awkward     the portions were good and food was acceptable  cant expect too much anyway 
terrible ripoff place   my iphone 6s plus cracked its screen from a 5  drop       shouldnt have happened so easily and i got nowhere complaining that i thought the screen was defective to begin with  so i had to get it repaired and informed them that i would consider suing to get my money back   at which point everyone stopped talking to me immediately     then after getting the repair done i asked for my broken screen back as proof that it was defective to begin with and guess what    they refused      gave me this paper showing it was theirs and i had agreed to it when signing for the repair   now why wouldnt they give it back to me as it effectively makes it almost impossible to prove it was defective in court without the part  sounds very fishy to me  imagine getting pets replaced at your auto mechanic and then being refused your old parts back  this company didnt get to be worth billions without ripping off a lot of people    i took pictures of my phone from every angle to show no damage to the case otherwise just a cracked screen  con artists and crooked as can be 
i stayed here for 2 years and the customer services was ok the 1st year then the 2nd its like they dont care  parking is horrible  the area is dirty  and bugs all over the place  when i moved out its was cleaner then when i moved in the apartment and they still charged me cleaning and new carpet  i will never again rent from here or any of there sister apartments  i have rented plenty of apartments before and this was the worst experience ever 
weve been together for 10 years    that says it all    not to mention she keeps herself current with the latest products   her work is classy    looking forward to  10 more years   thank you
real nice atmosphere  inside and outside seating  a nice place to bring your kids   i been there 3 times  for breakfast and lunch  egg poach for breakfast and salmon for lunch are on point   service getting into the restaurant is a little shaky  the guy that welcomed me into the restaurant on two occasions was not polite  ask for arelly as your waitress  she was wonderful  polite  quick and knows how to treat customers   i visited on a sunday afternoon and didnt understand why i had to wait 15 mins for a table upstairs and downstairs was empty  there was no waiter at the bar  the non polite guy said the waiter was upstairs   i will return and recommend to friends 
we were there on wednesday   just happened to be happy hour all day  great drink specials and tasty appetizers  the shrimp rolls were fantastic 
chelsea rules    seriously shes amazing and knows what shes doing and so professional  shes a darling young lady   thanks chelsea i love my hair
im pretty sure i got food poison from the seafood here  the oysters were yummy but the soft shell crab was a major disappointment  the crab was tiny and smothered in greasy batter  to the point that you cant taste the crab 
my daughter and i went here for restaurant week after reviewing dozens of menus   wed like an appetizer on one but not the main course or vise versa   when we saw ticoz  we wanted one of each appetizer  main course and dessert    we truly couldnt decide on the appetizer so we each ordered the cesar salad with lime chili dressing and then we shared an order of the calamari off the menu with probably the best dipping sauce ive ever had      it was a jalapeno lime sauce   yum   my daughter had green chili mac and cheese  does it get much better than that   and it was a huge portion   most of it went home for her lunch the next day   i opted for the blue corn enchiladas and they did not disappoint   they were accompanied by perfectly grilled zucchini    not too mushy  not to crisp   delicious   each of the dessert choices sounded great but neither of us could resist the kahlua creme brulee   i plan to take my husband when we go back to phoenix to visit in november    it was that good 
i stayed at the rio once  it was nice and affordable  its not located on the strip but its only 5 minutes away  the view i had was a distant strip view    the room was clean and the staff was nice  they dont have room service  parking wasnt too bad  overall  id recommend it 
good location   fast  but had sore stomach and diarrhea after having their lemonade   and some staff keeps coughing very loud in the back while we were sitting outside   oh well   not going back again i guess 
my whole family went and had a blast  we chose the prisoner room and it definitely forced us all to get along for the hour  we had our parents  two 18 year olds  an 8 year old and a 9 year old and it was a good challenge for all of us  although we had to use all three of our clues  we made it out with 12 minutes to spare  i wasnt expecting much going in but it was an awesome way to wrap up our trip in vegas  the only problem was that one part of one of the clues wasnt put back after the group before us went  but that wasnt a huge deal  if youre in vegas with your family i highly recommend going here 
best indian food ive ever had  attentive but not intrusive service  i got the duck tikka masala which was my first try and i loved it  tastes less buttery than what ive had in nyc and london 
friendly owner helped me find just what i needed in the time crunch i was in  shop is small and plaza is kinda old  but seems like they can special order anything that they dont have in stock in the back  ill probably come back here instead of drive all the way out to nellis or other military supply stores  nothing else close to this part of town  
adorable cat themed cafe in a sketchy run down looking strip mall  dont let the location hold you back  once inside  its as cute and clean as any taiwanese boba shop  my go to is the  1 on their top10 list   a blended ice milk drink with boba brown sugar egg pudding  they have a large tea menu to choose from and i havent had a bad one yet in my dozen  visits    the okinawa ice coffee taste like coffee ice cream  lots of food  snack offerings as well  theyre still testing out diff menu items  the hot pot and red oil dumplings i liked are no longer available so that means ill have to try more stuff    the happy guy that makes my drinks the past few times is always super friendly and always follows up asking about how your drink tastes  service is great and they are happy to customize your drink to just the way you like it 
great sandwiches what can i say  a bit pricey but its worth it bc of the great quality of ingredients   my bread never gets soggy  love that the turkey is cooked and shredded in house   if you havent tried it  my fave is the  cole turkey  or the  bobbie   i always get the 20 large to get the best bang for my buck and ask them to cut it into 4 pieces to share  or save it for myself later    the staff at all locations are pretty friendly and are always open to any customizations you have for your sandwich  if you have a more than 1 sandwich  call ahead to significantly decrease wait time 
friendly  great service  regular sized store with good clearance section  located next to bed bath and beyond in the gigantic arroyo market square 
i love this place  went twice in a month  its always full  you should make a reservation before u going  if u had bad luck and u still need to wait for some time even with reservation  it is bit expensive than others average japanese  all u can eat  but tin ichi worth the price   good services  perfect sushi  
nice neighborhood  the mall isnt that big  but we were trying to walk off our lunch  upscale shops that you are not going to find anywhere else  nice place to chill out and take your time 
i had my hair done with alicia and i was so happy  she did a great job at styling and cutting my hair as well as at coloring it  she was very professional  gave me good advice  and worked on my hair for more than 2 hours  the price was not cheap  about  200   but i guess these are the prices in this area for styling and color   
i use their wash and fold services  and im always happy  they do a good job and their prices are reasonable 
went to eez for my wifes birthday  she wanted sushi   almost all the specialty rolls were cooked or included cream cheese   we ordered nigiri and several rolls  i was disappointed in the quality of the fish   salmon was a little mushy and fishy   yellowtail was ok  but not great  the portion sizes were large and so were the prices   it looked like some other tables were enjoying entrees that might be a better choice than the sushi  the manager did come by at the end of the meal to ask about our experience   he seemed interested in our feedback and discounted our meal based on the feedback we gave him   the service and atmosphere were good   i might come back and try something besides sushi 
we were staying at planet hollywood for our honeymoon february 2017  i had seen the infomercial about this buffet while staying there  i begged my husband to take me  which he did   we ate there in thursday night  around 10pm and noticed it was a bit empty  i thought perhaps it was because its late   we were seated and were pleased to see a great variety of food  chinese  mexican  american  mediterranean  italian and seafood    we decided to try a plate of each  the food was cold  no flavor  just lacked taste  we tried everything on the menu with the hopes of finding something tasty  we decided to leave 20 minutes in  and asked to speak with the manager   my husband explained how bad our experience was and he said he could not give us a full refund  approximately  70  he said it had been more than 20 minutes  my husband continued to explain the experience we had and the manager decided to speak with the waitress  after he verified with her that we had served twice and 90  of the food was thrown he gave us two options  offered us a voucher to go the next day for breakfast or lunch  or half a refund   we opted for half a refund 
we normally find a couple of seats by the bar area so the service is quick and friendly  the omelettes are my favorite   good brunch place overall but i avoid seating inside of the restaurant if i can avoid it   almost every time we have been the kitchen manages to burn a toast or something so the interior of the restaurant smells like burnt toast  you would thing they will figure it out one of these days  either better toaster or a better venting 
great ice cream  cool place to hang out  kid friendly   you should come check it out   oh  and they bake all kinds of cookies and treats 
this was the worst dining experience i think ive ever had  the server was ill tempered and rushed  she spoke very harshly towards us  she took our order wrong because she didnt care to listen  our table was cleaned completely off before we left  we were there for no more than 35 min for dinner  manager condoned the disrespect 
first off  i am always for small business owners  i was in charlotte visiting a friend  i had a small leak coming from a rear tire that had been patched 6 months prior  i went to four different places before coming here  each place wanted to sell me a new tire and said they could not fix it  one place even said they were giving me a discounted price of 250 00 for a new tire  come on   my father didnt raise a stupid daughter    after seeing the reviews on yelp  i contacted cars  they were more than willing to take a look and boy am i glad they were there  not only did they replugged the leak  they were able to do it within 10minutes and for a wonderful price of  10 00  amazing  i did not feel as if i was treated like an idiot because i was a female in an auto repair shop and i did not wait long  one place had a wait time of 3 hours just to look at my car and another was 2  absurd  this place is well worth the little extra drive out of the way because you will save more time and money  i would recommend them to do anything in my car and feel completely confident in them  bravo  and hats off to a actual service center which is not a chain but real mom and pop business  dont waste your time with other places in north charlotte  they are only out to make so much money 
i think they need a few more production runs to work the kinks out of their process  they have pretty cool ideas that tend to be executed poorly  some of the worst beers ive ever had were at dubina  im not sure why they are willing to ruin their reputation by selling beers that came out horrible  a barleywine with 1 050 fg is disgusting    the only reason theyre getting 2 stars is because it is nice to have a microbrewery presence in glendale 
food is decent  not the best ive had  not worth the price though  for a place that claims they exist for the love of lobster  theyre pretty stingy  but i guess vegas is stingy in general 
the worst experience in a lounge ive ever had in my recent lifetime  i was moved  shuffled from table to table   i had a waitress actually plop down a reserved sign on my table while i was sitting there with no explanation   wtf  whilst being shuffled around arbitrarily  the pianist played at full volume and the servers never offered to move my drinks ever   despicable service levels for an overpriced  bloated self important lounge   im disgusted and will never return     as a guest of the hotel and a frequent visitor  this treatment is a game changer  i will never book my colleagues and friends here ever again 
im staying at the westgate resort   i researched pizza places that delivered to this hotel and this was one of several   so i placed my order online  requesting delivery service   not having any doubt at all that the pizza would be delivered to my room   ive stayed at hotels before and have never had a problem with deliveries to my room  so the delivery person called me about 20 min later saying shes leaving the restaurant now and ill have to meet her at outside   im at a hotel  thus the reason i ordered delivery   i dont want to get dressed and wait for the elevator and go through the whole hotel to go outside and get my order and then carry my pizza plus two other full bags back through the hotel and wait in line for 10 minutes for the elevator and take it up to my room   that is the whole point of delivery  and  i tipped   i wouldnt have tipped had i known they werent going to bring it up to my room  the delivery driver told me she couldnt bring it up to my room  hotel rules   so i get presentable  go down 17 floors  find the guest services desk  ask them where the east entrance is  walk through the hotel to find the correct entrance  and go outside and get my pizza   during the elevator ride up  theres a guy carrying a pizza   i think  well hes smarter than i am  he probably just got pizza from inside the hotel and is taking it up to his room   so imagine my surprise when i get off the elevator  and see that he gets off at my same floor  and walks down my same  hallway  and knocks on the door next to my room and hands off the pizza to my neighbors   i asked him what delivery company he was from  milanos  for future reference  to make it worse  there are no plates and napkins in my bags   im in a hotel  do you think i have my own plates and napkins    and  the pizza was supposed to have green bell peppers  but instead came with red   i called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager   i was told the manager was not in and they didnt know when he  she would be available because theyre very busy    so  long story short  if youre staying at the westgate in vegas  or any hotel  make sure you confirm with the restaurant that they will be delivering to your room 
its one of those places where you kinda want to give a cruddy review  but just dont see yourself having the heart to do  its a mediocre gift shop  whenever i come in here it reminds me of steve aoki and afrojacks music video no beef and it makes me wanna wear one of those styrofoam oversized cowboy hats and cause ruckus inside the store  but of course i wouldnt be able to pull that off like them    they have a large inventory of various gifts  some of the things will make you think how long theyve had the items there for  they have things in there that look so outdated  they may be older than me  its a huge store and whatever you see  you get  dont try asking if they have something because youre answer will be   whatever we have out is all we have   i saw these shorts i wanted on a mannequin and i didnt see it so i asked if they have it in their stock room  anywhere else at the store and that was the answer he gave me    overall  its a tacky yet fun souvenir shop that has loads of options to choose from  its also a fun place to just roam around but be aware of the outdated and limited inventory as well  even though its a ginormous store  
i contacted marty about a month and a half ago about a specific car i wanted  i could not be any happier with what he found  way under the mileage i was expecting and for such a good price  he was honest  upfront and you can feel that he is an all around good  genuine guy  id recommend him in a heartbeat to anyone looking for their next dream car  he helped me find mine   thank you again  marty 
we came here ready to eat delicious burgers and then realized we were too full for delicious burgers after fukuburger earlier in the day  we settled for delicious fries and a shake  the sweet potato fries were basically perfect   the right crisp outside  soft inside  thinness  sweetness  love  well be back for a burger someday 
somehow  we managed to squeeze ten people around a table thats probably meant for eight  they were super nice about trying to get us all comfortably put at our table  we fit at the table a lot better before the meal than after the meal   the menu is minimalist  it basically reads like  duck  pig  duck  seafood  without mention of sides or prep  between the internet and accommodating servers  though  you can figure out what makes sense for you   ironically  i ordered no pork  with ten at the table  i figured id be able to snack on others pork  which was true    i had my fair share of feet   i got      hen liver terrine  so smooth and rich  with nice sides of picked onion and fruity compote     duck carpaccio  came with paper thin slices of mushrooms and an egg yolk  perfectly balanced and creamy  i just slurped it up on the endless supply of slices of the hearty bread     foie gras poutine  i wouldve preferred more fries to balance out the amount of other richness  i almost ordered another side of fries to dump in  but realized that i might die of richness if i did so   i also tried the duck with mushroom sauce and aforementioned pied  both of which were great  it took so long to get the bill that i was getting a little nauseous from fullness and the meaty smell that pervaded everything  but i made it out alive   giant mirrors help you stalk the bathrooms  one on each side of the bar  so you can catch someone coming out and jump in  one bathroom has a tv mounted at eye level  i watched a bit of hockey  and the other has a giant trough sink  random   so yeah   try it  bring a group so you can sample lots of stuff  dont be afraid to ask questions  wear stretchy pants 
tonight we had a party of 8   our food took forever   it came at various times instead of all at once   other dinner guest were getting their food before we all did   along with the people with carryout   some of the food was cold and had to be sent back   even that took awhile to come back out  we and other patrons dining in had to replenish their own drinks   i had an italian sub   there was hardly any meat   what meat there was  was cut super thin   there was lots of lettuce  tomatoes  onions  peppers   dressing   i will not be going there again 
if you want clean linen  clean room  odor free and some what decent  custom service well than this is not your hotel   we were supposed to spent two nights in this place but cut it to one night   we would not have spent the one night either if it wasnt too late to look for another hotel      as soon as we entered the room we were greeted with strong odor of bleach   we asked to b moved to another room   and in this new room  had stained sheets and dusty closet   what a horrible night  what a horrible hotel what a horrible experience    the next day we went auberge du vieux port hotel and we couldnt be more happy 
manager named jacqueline  joclyn   has a terrible attitude  we were supposed to get a  16 credit for a nasty pizza they delivered to us last week  she informed me she didnt see the  6 credit and our total didnt reach their minimum delivery order  i informed her i would call papa johns to order and her last words were  its your loss   that is the kind of attitude that will put them out of business  we  used  to order regularly  no more   starting with the bad order last week this store is going downhill fast 
fantastic place for lovers of parrots big and small   lively atmosphere  great selection of toys  food and supplies   lots of bird mascots and even babies to say hello to  and they have adopted some feather pluckers too   always a good reminder that parrots need tons of love and attention to stay happy   thank you 
this place was amazingly delicious  had the prime rib special and the  5 beer and burger   
it was my first time here   and ive eaten at their previous bloor west village location years back   great raw cuisine  today was a first peak to meet the owners and meet a community networker   great french press coffee  and a great vibe for a quaint spot  ill have to get back for a proper meal   angus and chelsea  the owners  are delightful  be sure to say hi 
saks is a necessity in the west valley   lots of great clothes     displayed well now   i think they hired some new staff   it looks nice   i always stop in for a few key pieces  
one of the best places to celebrate w family  the food is fantastic   service is too    we have had several family outings here   everyone always says it is sooo delicious     now brunch  
i sent one of my daughter and her sister who came to town very nice people here  good clean salon   love the atmosphere   you did a great job and the girls are beautiful  
this place is the best   the people are always so helpful and friendly  the self baths are great  great set up 
i regularly eat at sushi mon in silverado ranch and wanted to try a new place  no comparison  service here was bad  young female waitress was lost   sushi was so so but maguro was not  the freshest i have eaten  hamachi okay  hamachi kama and sauce cant beat sushi mon  i will stick to eating sushi at sushi mon from now on 
im not vegan but i love coming here  great pulled jack fruit sandwich  wicked good caesar salad and killer killer killer desserts  better than bunners  omg i said it
if i went to school at cpcc  i would probably be drinking here between classes   so convenient to the area   sadly  im not there all the time but still stop by when i get a chance   this place used to be called sk net cafe and it was cool  but nothing truly special   there is just a vibe there now that you cant get anywhere in else in charlotte   its kinda like a small coffee shop crowd  meets noda bar crowd  with all types of live music depending on the night   great beers  good mixed drinks  pretty good coffee and a chill crowd  what else can you ask for   there isnt really that much else to say about this place  just go see it yourself 
solid salads that are not at all hesitant about volume  there is a substantial bed of greens with a wide selection of ingredients that should work for any salad enthusiast    they might initially skimp on topping  whether out of policy or to keep the ingredients from falling out of the bowl  but they do add more if you ask  the chili vinaigrette dressing did not really stand out when i added it to my meal  for first timers  note that there are roasted vegetables later on in the buffet of selections  so if you prefer those to raw ones  anticipate that and wait for later to add peppers  broccoli  cauliflower
i dont know what they put in their chocolate but i often find im craving this place   i especially love their soy bars dipped in one of the chocolate sauces   everything takes so fresh and delicious 
one of my favourite restaurants   glad they finally opened a location nearby  as i use to drive to the markham rd location all the time   they just opened on dec 5th in time for my birthday    so excited             update   dec 2016  after many meals over the past year  ive unfortunately decided to downgrade my rating from 5 to 1   im not sure what it is about this place  in comparison to their markham location   but every time i eat here i get a really bad stomach ache the next day   im thinking it has something to do with the oil they use  but not sure   as a result  ive completely stopped coming here 
i came here for an early dinner with my wife today   it was my first time and her 3rd     my wife is a vegan that is allergic to dairy   so it can be challenging at times to find a place she will enjoy    the food was amazing   we had the tandoori mushrooms  sagh with potatoes   garlic naan and biriyani rice   i highly recommend the tandoori mushrooms   highlights    food tasted great and was not greasy at all   being a new restaurant everything is brand new and very clean   extremely hygienic    the service was the best part   our waitor  ali  was extremely friendly and even remembered my wife from her first visit   shes pregnant  and he even remembered the gender of the child from their previous conversation weeks prior along with the fact that she had specific food restrictions     i have to admit i was a bit hesitant at first based on some other reviews i read about price and them constantly trying to get you to buy alcohol and pricier dishes   this was not the case at all   i even asked the waiter what he recommended and he was very honest   my one negative was the pricing was a bit high and the portion sizes were quite small  but i guess someone has to pay for the nice decor     overall  a pleasant experience and good food   but bombay bhel down the street still remains as my favourite spot in the area for indian food         update as of july 1  2015        i came here with our family for a late sunday lunch   from our previous visits to now  the quality has deteriorated quite a bit   the decor is still stunning   but the food quality is not what it was a couple months ago   the food was extremely salty  bland and i felt extremely bloated afterwards    while the prices are still quite high     i think going forward ill be sticking with my original favourite int he area   bombay bhel down the street 
worst burrito place ive ever been to   the food is extremely bland with no taste   the franchise focuses more on quick service but overlooked quality and taste   i highly recommend you stay away from this one 
worst poutine ever   had the montreal poutine and was thoroughly disgusted   maybe something else is better but was not impressed on my first visit 
although i could easily see people getting this place confused with the long standing restaurant soul that happens to be on central it is quite different   this is great soul  southern food with a little island flair if you want   when i walked up i was a little confused   i expected to be smelling some ham hocks in collards and all i could smell was curry   once i got inside though  i realized that this place had a little more diversity than your average soul food spot   i ordered myself some jerk chicken  green beans  mac and cheese and some jalapeno corn bread   i ordered some meatloaf and mash potatoes for my cohort   the jerk chicken certainly didnt blow me away  but everything else was awesome   great creamy mac and cheese   perfectly cooked green beans   plus  that corn bread aint no joke either   all that food  plus drinks for under  20   i will certainly be back 
i cant believe i never reviewed this one before   a very classy but casual spot in the university area   amazing wine and beer selection   good cheeses  live music  outdoor patio where you can bring you dog    all of this right by the lake   these guys also schedule tastings and pairings at some local restaurants   ranging from  25 80 ish per person  it is well worth it   i highly recommend this place for a casual after dinner date spot or a gathering of friends 
they just opened   i mean just opened the doors   there isnt even a sign yet   i think the actual grand opening is next week   nice decor  friendly service  and good ramen   the booths have large pieces of rope in between them   it gives a barrier  but yet doesnt make you feel confined   our server was very friendly and extremely attentive   that said  he needs some practice with his spiel   the descriptions of some things were extremely vague  and others just seemed more like rambles and no real point ever made   that will all come with time  and i knew what i wanted anyhow   as far as the food goes   i assumed it was just a ramen bar before entering   only to find out later it was a japanese style tapas bar that served ramen as well   i really enjoyed my noodles   it wasnt like the quality you would hope to expect in a major city like ny  san fran  or d c   but a nice addition to the charlotte food scene   with so many pho places in the area  its nice to have another option   as per the tapas   the small bites were pretty small bites  and not cheap either   i wouldnt say over priced for the area  especially at  12 13 for a huge bowl of ramen   but at 6 12ish plus a pop for small bites and similar prices for yakitori  it can add up fast   some of these little bites may be amazing and totally worth it  ill have to try again   however  personally  id rather be full for  12  than still hungry after spending  20   for you drinkers  the bar is fully stocked   plenty of sake and a few beers on tap   bottom line is that this place has some potential   i think local foodies will give it a chance as well as the plaza midwood scene   im glad their doing a soft opening for now as they were out of a lot of things  and the staff is still wet behind the ears   all that should get fixed asap   ill be back 
really cheap pints on monday nights   as do all brixx   the food is the same  the tap list is different but very  national    they ran out of the local bird song higher ground after 2 3 beers   they did have a small pour imperial ipa though   mostly female wait staff  but they all looked like teenagers i dont go just to hit on the waitresses  but these girls look to young to be serving booze    just a different vibe in general as per other brixx imo   brixx is great   quick  made to order thin crust pizzas   mmmmmm pear and gorganzola   but yet  this venue just doesnt have the same vibe   seems more like a kids restaurant than the downtown  fairview  or ballentyne location   im always down for buy one get one pizza and apps after 10pm but i have a feeling that the new duckworths will take a lot of the beer drinkers away from this place and the taco mac across the street   birkdale will always pull a crowd  just not me on a night besides  2 pint mondays 
fun           well  not really  but thats what the name says   this is your basic sauce ladened  sodium drenched  cheap  quick lunch chinese spot   everybody needs one  but this one just aint mine   i stumbled accross this place while roaming through concord killing some time   it didnt look that promising  and i got what i expected   lots of food  for a good price   it wasnt good food  but it was lots of it   be wary  but decent for a luncheon quickie 
not too bad of an experience  but you will be treated like your getting on a plane before entering   i understand that security in government offices is a good idea and that some peoples entire incomes and citizenship may ride on these employees decisions  but a full on tsa vibe walking in seems like a little much   that said  the whole place is ran rather smoothly   nothing like the dmv  most of the people are smiling and are actually helpful   not a place you need to go very often  but unless your getting deported or something  it shouldnt be treated with the same dreaded  do i really have to go deal with these people   like most intercity dmv offices 
very tastey  but a little pricey for dinner   at least for my cheap budget 
this place is first rate  great service  great food  great drinks  also the prices are very reasonable  a very casual place with fresh ingredients  an open kitchen you can see the cooks doing their magic and a bar where you can see the great coctails being ceeated  not a large place and we had reservations for an early saturday evening  our part had their market burger  3 meat bolognese and gnocchi  everything was great    well definately be back 
their restaurant serves very good mexican  street food  not fancy but had their chicken enchiladas and another in the party their burrito  both were very good and prices very fair  the restaurant sits in front of the ballroom so its not big but they have outside seating which is nice  also a bar serving drinks  service was great too  definitely will go back 
weve been there for sit down dining but tonight it was take out  big mistake  pad thai was lousy  tasteless and very under sauced  egg rolls were saughy and the fried rice had huge chunks of vegetables  ridiculous big  in phoenix its a chinese food wasteland so with pf chang sucking like this  were  very disappointed   not sure well try it again 
im giving up on marcos  the pizza is not that great and they have gotten my order wrong for the third time now 
this is my first fancy restaurant in arizona  and it certainly deserves to be one of the best  one i will return to for special occasions    my wife picked it as a romantic spot for her birthday  and it didnt disappoint    this place is awesome  you drive in  the palm lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere  the valet takes your car  and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns  warmly welcomed into the dining room  which is surrounded in brick  long drapes  and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel  the chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay    waitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be    one thing that i really note is the bread course  is the bread hot or cold  how is it served  here  a small loaf of italian bread with the signature dustings of flour  signifying an  artisan  bread  was served with a small bowl of fresh pesto sauce  the bread was hot  the crust crispy  the sauce deelish  it was a good omen    the food was all first rate  while i had a vegetarian string  yummy quorn empenadas  pear salad  and the delicately fried stuffed squash blossoms  my wife had the escargots napoleon  she loved it   the lobster bisque  which i tried  great flavor   and the meditteranean lamb  i also had a side dish of potato puree  creamy garlicky heaven    it is an expensive place  but i would say it is worthwhile  and definitely good for a special night  the food was delicious and servings reasonable  if you get all the courses  you can actually take some home  the dessert menu was quite extensive  too  i think enough to please everyone  i definitely would go back sometime  just make sure you have money in the bank  know what i mean 
well i see a number of recent diners have had issues with the service   not here   i was with a group of about 10 people on a saturday early eve  and all orders were taken and delivered efficiently  properly  and all at about the same time  which is excellent   very happy with the service   the food  however  seemed lacking in flavor   i had a wild mushroom pizza   it could have used more zip   and no pizza condiments were on the table to add more pep   the roasted veggie salad looked good  but reality was some veggies mixed in with a lot of lettuce   having dressing on the side removed some of the flavor maybe  but the veggies could have been more interesting   frankly  the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza    made fresh  should have a lot more flavor   sadly  it didnt   perhaps trying other dishes would be better here   maybe they are being too diverse and need to focus on the fundamentals    they have tacos  for petes sake 
we went yesterday  not their  grand opening  yet but things were operating smoothly   too bad some other reviewers felt the need to diss this place   when we went  all ice cream flavors were listed on a menu and on little placards near the ice cream itself  garbage can was available  and seating was as much as feasible inside and out without creating a mob scene   and no one was  touching themselves    geez  sounds tittilating   so  on to the ice cream  the friendly gal helping us happily let us taste all the different flavors we wanted to   then made a waffle bowl for my wife   i got a waffle cone with two flavors   the pecan praline was quite good   i also had a standard   mint chocolate chip   yeah  i wouldnt say any of their flavors were real exotic  but maybe thats not what people want   ok  people  maybe the basics sell best   and maybe theyll experiment and rotate in some different ones   my waffle cone dripped though the bottom   so what   am i gonna fault them for it   fuhgeddaboutit   ice cream drips  capisce     all in all  all staff were fun and friendly  service was quick  there was no big line when we went on a saturday night   and the place was clean and bright   its a perfect place to get hard ice cream in downtown gilbert    especially if your tastebuds are singing from some of the spicy food from some of the neighboring eateries    btw  they said theyll have more offerings at their grand opening     ill be back   i suggest you do  too 
my wife told me about this place and said she loved the food  so after a recent appointment we were free on a weekday and went there for lunch  not during the lunch rush   not many people there so we had our choice of tables   for appetizers  we had the roquefort flammenkuchen  which is like a tiny pizza with melted blue cheese  small pieces of pear  crushed walnuts  mozzarella and sour cream on top   it easily could feed one person  but we split it   while small  it was rich  and very tasty with the various flavors   we also got their garlic bread  which was a piece of french bread sliced vertically  in other words  its not like you get part of a loaf  toasted with garlic butter and cheese   it was very good  but expected more of a serving   for entrees  we both got crepes   i got the mediterranee  which has 4 5 big sea scallops  delicately cooked and served with a sauce with saffron and cheese   it was very good   while not big  the richness of the sauce helped make it more filling   there is also a little salad served on the side of the plate   my wife got the nordique  which is a similar plate except it has smoked salmon with a cream and cheese sauce   i tasted that  yum   what is very interesting about these crepes is that they are square with the edges folded over and made of buckwheat  which makes them a bit heartier     the dessert menu is very tempting with a variety of dessert crepes  but i felt we should do a fondue  so we got the chocolate fondue for 2   the chocolate sauce is made from melted bittersweet chocolate mixed with whipping cream and kept gently heated   there are little brownies  sliced strawberries  apples  and cream puffs to dip   it was literally finger licking good   nice touch  as the designated driver  i got a root beer  and was given a free refill without me asking   my wife got a glass of wine from an extensive wine and beer list   the waitress was very friendly  helpful  and gave us great service   this place also has a comedy night and musical entertainment certain nights  too   this is quite a gem   i will definitely be back   one small nit  as some others have written  it can be quite expensive  especially with drinks and desserts 
thursday night my girlfriend and i did this together  first time for us both  we were really excited to try something new  it wasnt that full but it just right  big open spaces  i love the cage rooms  we like being watched  i got to watch a few couples do a lot of things  some people i helped as they did so  we came back two days in a row  the second day was even better  i just wanted to keep cuming  a few more couples and open questions  i will be back 
if you really want try or like  spicy and hot food then its the tiny  nepali indian combined restaurant around las vegas area  also they have buffet too which i liked  i suggest them hope they make more restrooms   
we came for lunch ayce and it was very good  not the most vast selection compared to others in the area  maki sushi  but still decent  seaweed salad was great  beef skewers had a yummy sauce   the yam tempura and the fried udon was a little too oily  disclaimer  i dont eat sushi   only the cooked stuff  but my wife says the sushi was good  dessert included cheesecake  mango mousse and the good quality red bean ice cream brand    you order everything via a tablet and everything had pictures 
this tanning salon is awesome  friendly  knowledgeable staff who care about your skin instead of making a buck  plenty of clean beds with great bulbs  i have never been dissatisfied coming to this salon  will go back many times 
i have now been to smith twice  both times for brunch  i must say the staff is very helpful and friendly  and good looking    first time i had the banana bread  i wasnt feeling particularly hungry  which was very bland  i blamed myself for getting something so boring  the last time i was there i had waffles which were delicious  i only finished half  i ordered a side of fruit which was a big mistake as the waffles have a whole field of berries on them    the good   1  staff  friendly and accommodating  one of my favorite things about a resto  2  atmosphere  good ambiance and people here  mix of old and young  gay and straight  everyone seems to love this place   the bad   1  cost  a lot of the items are a bit expensive  example  a mimosa is  9   2  selection  the selection here is not great  the menu is quite small   recommendation  try this place out for brunch if you are nearby  i cant speak on dinner 
horrible  just horrible    first  the man at the cash register was extremely rude taking our order  second  they called our number about 10 minutes after we ordered  my partner went up to grab it  and its only 1 out of 2 burgers that were done  why call the number if its not done  third  my burger had no cheese on it even though we paid an extra dollar for it  she says  sorry  and slaps a piece of cheese on it  thanks for the cold cheese slice on my burger  fourth  yes there is a fourth   our fries were disgusting and soggy    honestly  i never expect much from this chain  but this was beyond horrible  horrible enough that theyre getting a corporate email requesting my money back    i will never go back to this location and my recommendation for you is hard pass 
do you like being served by people who dont speak english  do you like your chili microwaved  do you happen to enjoy parts of your order being left out   well if so  this tim hortons is for you   seriously  though   the worst location i have ever been to  chili is cold  they dont give you the roll  or the butter      or the spoon  and i honestly cant understand anything anyone says there   avoid if you can 
4 5  5  had the pleasure of being taken out to spark to grab lunch and was definitely not disappointed  this place is super cute and trendy  very fitting for the ossington area    working in korea town it can get hard to find nice healthy food for lunch  but this place came with glowing recommendations  their staff is super friendly and knowledgable and their offerings are unique  i was very surprised that we were the only two people eating here at lunch time  more people need to try it out  i hope they can pull it off and be successful   i had the  fueled  bowl    a great salad with rice  lentils  roasted sweet potatoes  zucchini  mushrooms  spicy cashew cream  and microgreens  amazing taste  will definitely be back for more items   the good  1  fresh  the food is super fresh and delicious 2  decor  very trendy and hip  3  staff  friendly staff and surprisingly the place is pretty high tech  including emailed receipts    the bad  1  price  its a bit pricey for the items and i wasnt completely full afterwards   i definitely recommend checking this place out 
peter was awesome   he shaped my nails just as i asked  everyone working was extremely nice  i will be returning soon for a pedicure 
i attended one of cherie   cos mini makeover sessions and was so happy with my visit  i left with a bag full of goodies  cheryl is so sweet and her group is so helpful and eager to answer questions on beauty and make up tips  i have nothing but kudos to send their way  im huge on customer service and love spreading the word to friends and family  cheryl is always accessible and takes really good care of her clientele  thanks cherie   co  for being truly awesome 
obsessed    thats about the word that sums up this place for me  after having to satisfy my jenis cravings in the whole foods ice cream aisle while living in philadelphia  i was really excited when i moved to cleveland and could actually go to the ice cream shop  i know that this ice cream is originally from columbus  but its definitely my favorite here in cleveland  the flavors are so inventive and divine  my favorites are the saison with flax and sunflower seeds and the yazoo sue with rosemary bar nuts  they are great together as well  the ice cream cups are a bit more expensive  when compared to mitchells  but i find the flavors to be much more rich that i dont feel im losing out on quality  the macaron ice cream sandwiches are also divine 
what a super cool grocery  bright clean space  super friendly staff  and a huge selection of organic  locally grown produce make this a must go when in the neighborhood    lots of natural products and a huge variety of vegetarian   veggie  meat substitutes too     a few of the prices for produce seemed a little steep but others were quite reasonable    to die for salad bar items 
not the greatest ice cream or service but the three stars come from the wonderful nostalgic atmosphere and interesting selection of sweets
yesterday was my first time trying dufflet  what have i been missing    i know this place is fairly well known  but i had never come across it before  the shop is in the queen east area  which is near the beaches  ive been to the beaches  but never traveled up to queen  plus im a queen west girl   the shop is extremely clean  i didnt plan on buying anything  i just wanted to take a peek at all the goodies  but i couldnt resist  everything looked perfect  from the cookies  to the cakes  to the date bars  we ended up getting a molten lava cake  the lady heated it up and we gobbled it down   the smoothest  richest  and most chocolaty cake ever   inside there was the melted chocolate sauce  which wasnt too liquidy but just perfect  the little small piece costs a bit under  5  a little pricey  but its a treat  not something id buy on a daily basis   so im ok with the price    you can buy larger cakes and tortes  6  signature cakes and tortes range from the mid 20s   and 10  in the mid 40s  i may try one of the cakes  its hard these days to find quality cakes and pastries  it seems everyone freezes things now  just not the same 
grassroots is a pretty nifty store for the environmental hipster    the environmental era has hit in full swing  so this is the store to be in   hahaha  no just joshing   but seriously  its a cool store    everything in the store is environmentally friendly or made out of recycled materials  they have some really nice stationary sets  and hey if it helps the environment   other than that  they also sell clothes  im not sure what the deal is behind the clothes  maybe its made out of hemp or something  im not entirely sure  anyway  they look rather normal   they even had a shrug  which confused the hell out of my boyfriend   our conversation went something like this  what the heck is this  why is it so short   why is there a big hole  oh so its not meant to cover the front area       sigh   another really interesting thing they sell are household cleaners  now i figured with all the chemicals in household cleaners that they probably arent the most environmentally friendly item out there  but i didnt realize that they made a whole line of environmentally friendly cleaners  they had a bunch of refill pumps there  which makes them extremely super duper friendly  i guess you bring in your old bottle and get it re filled     im thinking well be seeing more of these stores soon  pretty neat  
loblaws is my secret love  ive been with this supermarket since they first opened and ive watched it carve out a little niche for itself    sniff sniff   the great thing about this loblaws is that its opened late  until 11pm   which is great especially if you desperately need to buy something  just last week i forgot to buy my mom a birthday card  it was around 9 45pm so the malls were already closed  i went to loblaws and picked her up a sweet b day card  thank you loblaws   this loblaws is massive  it has a pharmacy  home decor  kitchen accessories and small appliances  as well as clothes and a good life gym  which is for women only  sorry dudes    i picked up a nice large pumpkin today which costs only  2  ssssweeeettt    the best part of this loblaws is probably the self checkout counters  it fulfills my desire to be a cashier  i love it 
ask anyone i know  if theres one thing i hate spending money on  its food  my logic is this  i buy food  enjoy it  this is not certain  for a whole 15 30 minutes and then a day later  it comes out the other end   what do i have to show for spending my hard earned money  a hot stinky mess    i dont mind spending money on food  dont get me wrong   its kinda a necessity  but when it comes to groceries  its all about cost cutting  shopping at longos  loblaws  dominion and michael angelos are all nicesupermarkets  but when im all about the bottom line  i go to food basics     food basics is just that  very basic  i much prefer no frills over food basics  but will settle   food basics i believe is associated with dominion and that brand of companies  they sell masters choice products as their in store brand   food basic i find lacks in the produce department   if you want to find cheap produce  go to t t or no frills    one thing food basics is good on is their general grocery department  canned and boxed foods are much cheaper than the average supermarket  and you can fix more or less the same thing   ive never looked through the meat department  but their bread  bakery section leaves more to be desired  it is afterall  food basics 
i didnt realize there was another location of urban outfitters in toronto  this location is on the south east side of queen street w and spadina   you cant miss the big wooden oversize doors  inside its a pretty standard urban outfitters store   there are two floors  the first floor sells womens wear  accessories  scarfs  purses etc  and little weird gifts    i looked at the sunglasses and found a pair that i quite enjoyed  and by enjoy i meant that didnt look hideous on me  and that were reasonably priced    20  unfortunately their color selection waned  and i didnt end up buying them  i will have to make my way to the yonge street location sometime soon    they also had a wide selection of fall scarfs  my friend is obsessed with scarfs and i think it has rubbed off on me somewhat  as i had a sudden urge to buy a scarf  they had some nice scarfs and some not so nice ones    i love the clothes here  i found a nice long cardigan  something that ive been looking for for a while   too bad it was severely overpriced  i would have liked to add it to my cardigan collection 08 
im a huge huge games fan  i love games  the thing is im a sore loser and an even sorer  is that a word   winner  so finding someone to play with can be challenging  anyhoo  this is the best place to find games  im serious  from board games  puzzle books  hand held games to pool tables and dart boards    they have a wide selection of board games    think monopoly only comes in one variety  oh baby you are wrong  i went today to look for a small rubics cube  im a geek like that  and found a keychain size  perfecto    this store is just awesome  i dont know how else to describe it  its a little pricey  though i dont know how comparable to other stores  if anything  they difference is only a few bucks   staff extremely friendly and personable 
i too am not a fan of h m  i find their clothes flimsy  generic and trendy and for their price tag id expect more  mind you  if you can find stuff on sale here  there are deals to made  you just have to search     this h m unlike a lot of other ones ive been too is fairy clean and organized   everything is nicely organized and things are places back in their correct location  so you arent searching through racks to see if the size  style you want has been misplaced somewhere else  they have a decent sale section as well   h m is what it is  and if you like what it is  then i cant really complain about this store 
lovely little store with organic products  from cheese to chocolate  beer to produce   amazing sandwiches and superb customer service  you feel like youve been shopping there for decades every time you visit  and if you need anything they dont have  just ask and they will do whatever they can to get it for you 
we like the food here  except dont get the mediterranean wrap  that was not so good  the pastrami and the club sandwiches are great  my reason for the 2 stars is that the service is less than desirable  if you eat in  you will have a better experience probably  i did on 2 occasions  however  on 3 occasions they have gotten it wrong when we did take out each time  and note that the place was not busy  one time they never let us know our food was ready  we waited quite a long time and then checked and lo and behold they said they called our name  but the place was empty  so not sure whose name they called or how loud they called it  the 2nd and 3rd time they got the order wrong  and did not really offer an apology or to make it up to us 
yes  its a  theme  restaurant  but in my opinion the only thing that may appear theme ish is the fact that they serve deep dish pizza   which is quite tasty  by the way    i do not like beer  but for those who do enjoy the frosty beverage  they have several local and on site drafts on tap  my boyfriend really enjoys their summer ale at the moment   they have a fairly extensive menu  which ranges from gourmet pizzas to pot roast to standard bar fare  the food is definitely good  but some items are a little on the expensive side  for example  a large chicken caesar salad will set you back  12  its decently portioned  but its still chopped lettuce with some chicken   conversely  the chicken parmigiana  which is absolutely delicious  is  12 99  but any average eater could easily get two meals out of it   the staff is nice and fairly attentive  but sometimes the service is a little slow  depending on if you sit in the bar or not and the time of day   id definitely recommend  but know youre probably going to throw down about  20 to get the full chicago experience 
if i could give them 0 stars i would  i asked for a manicure and pedicure  i got a french tip on both my feet and hands which normally looks super clean    vi was my nail tech for my manicure  she did not apply a base coat    not sure if it was because she got mad at me  if she forgot  or didnt know how to do a french manicure    so the normal pink hue is not there    she asked me if i was from phoenix  and i said no  and so i asked her about her and she just stopped talking to me  i went on to ask her another question in case she didnt hear me  but now she was just ignoring me  she went on to do the white line after cleaning my nails  and she is doing it while im getting a pedicure  this salon is tempe marketplace  so im sure they get super busy which makes sense why they do it at the same time    but she keeps tugging me while the nail tech doing my pedicure is also tugging me  she sets down my hand on the towel and one of my white tips gets smudged  so she gets mad at me and tells me to be more careful  okay  sorry its hard for me to pay attention to everyone of my limbs when im getting tugged in 4 directions    also i didnt set my hand down she did  so i know for a fact i didnt curl my nail after she set it down  she then tried to grab my other hand  but i explained that i need to sit up more because i keep getting tugged  so i need her to give me a second    she then pulls harder on my hand instead of being understanding and uses my leg as a resting post for her to get better leverage on my hand    i dont understand why she couldnt walk around  she made me feel like i was inconveniencing her    she finishes applying the white lines does one coat of top coat and storms away to a back room  the nail tech doing my pedicure looks at my nails makes a face and grabs another nail tech to do one more top coat      but it was too late  they already looked bad and now two days later the white looks more of a tan color and is chipped    which is a bummer because my pedicure looks really cute    i cannot believe i paid for this manicure 
very nice rooms  but service was horrible  first  they didnt have the original room we were supposed to get with the strip view  second  the room we got reeked of cigarette smell  my friend has asthma so that was not okay  and all they said was well send someone over to neutralize the room which they never did  thirdly  after an hour waiting for our bags to arrive they never did until we had to go back down and ask for them again  when they finally delivered our belongings  i noticed that my pillow case was all torn up and the man literally just rolled his eyes and left  and the worst part was  around 8am the next day  when we were all sleeping someone opened our room without knocking  peeked in and left   we had no idea who it was   after that we had two other occasions where they literally just tap our door and come in  theyre excuse was  i knocked and no one answered   well  we need more than an instant to get to the door  worst service ever 
this was right up my ally   20 all you can drink draft beer and 80s dj  right  not for everyone but i love the pub scene and diablos has that  the staff are great and i enjoyed the atmosphere 
not a bad joint  the pink tacos are pretty good  and margaritas are worth a try  the jalopino margarita will warm the soul  and the nachos are not single serving  i love the ambiance of this place and am glad i came here  check out the daily special  and you must try the link taco  yum 
was there on a sunday at about 2 30 and was kind of rushed through out lunch as they had to get ready for dinner  they also forgot our miso soup but other than that the sushi was really good  other than that  the service was good  our food came at a resonable time and the waitress was attentive to our table  my favourite role is spicy salmon and at this restaurant the portion was slightly bigger than most other ayce sushi restaurants ive been to  id go back again 
people are friendly and we love the food     i especially love the butter and cracker station    
total body workouts  everyday is a different circuit training  damon always motivating  no words can explain what a beast of a workout this place gives you
so unique and scrumptious   we tried arroz con leche  mexican chocolate  banana  pineapple  blackberry with lavender   each one was amazing   my son chewed on his popsicle stick like a bone   
came here for brunch with my girlfriends  were all in our early 30s    we had reservations and were seated promptly  their coffee is good  the pastries are delicious  you can get the same pastries at their stand in the venetian   i loved the strawberry croissant   i had the bouchon french toast  it was good but i was not overly impressed   the oeuf   boudin blanc was pretty tasty though  next time  ill have to try the chicken and waffles 
ate at firebirds in brentwood  tn and chandler  az over the past month  food is great  prices are reasonable for the portions you receive  the menu has a great variety of options  service is also good    atmosphere is a bit noisy but sitting towards the back corner helped  the bread is delicious and they bring as much as you would like  i had the salmon which was delicious and perfectly cooked    i gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because we had ordered a steak medium and it came back well done  im not sure if they thought we wouldnt notice it because it had been smothered in blue cheese sauce and mushrooms but it was clearly over done for medium  the manager was nice and comped that meal  which we didnt expect but appreciated 
yum  great food  i had the chicken burrito which was great  next time  ill ask for rice to be included in the burrito  though  our friends had green chile burritos and loved them 
felt very unwelcome when i came in  the staff made me feel uncomfortable and it was disappointing that they only made particular dishes on certain days
used to be a great place  now terrible service and not worth the price  only gave two stars because i like the owner  just this locations management is bad 
one of the greatest dining experiences ive had all year  maybe all life  burger was succulent  excellent roll  each bite was juicy and delicious  the oreo milkshake had some amazing aftertastes  and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one   i went into a food coma afterwards for about 1  2 a day   we ate at 4 p m   and i was done for the rest of the day   highly  highly recommended 
i didnt stay here  but i wanted to after walking through it  staring at the screens and gawking at the people  finding the secret pizza place  having shakes and burgers at holsteins  and generally  falling in love with the cosmpolitan   loved seeing it for an hour  have to stay here for real 
had a sushi boat between 4 of us  the rice was really sweet  not enjoyable  ive had take out from here before and it wasnt so bad but this time was disappointing    my friend had an udon which was served in a stone bowl  the kind you get with korean soon tofu or bimbambap and i think it was quite unnecessary  the dumplings became soggy and the soup was too hot to save anything before they were over cooked  the broth and overall flavour was good though   id give a 2 5 if i could because they arent usually this bad  again rice was too sweet 
let me start off by saying this is the only brewery in charlotte that offers late hours  and a full menu  complete with late night options  that alone is a valuable asset to this place  my counterpart and i went one night in search of good brews and some good eats  and knew we had to try heist after hearing so much about it  since we were late  we ordered from the late night menu  wings and the duck flatbread  the wings had a nice smoky  grilled flavor  but i gotta say i wasnt impressed by the sauce  extremely mild  if youre a lover of spice  would have liked to have tried the japanese black style with ponzu  but we were told they werent available at that point in the evening  the duck flatbread was tasty  loved the root beer bbq sauce  but could have standed to taste a little more duck  next time i come  im going for the pork belly corn dogs  they just sound too damn good  and they must be considering that theyd sold out of them for the evening  the beers were good  but i feel that they need more time to develop their recipes  just like any new brewery  i drank at least four pints of the porter  and tasted all the others  except for the i2pa  which was not yet on tap  this is also another thing i must make a point of ordering next time  the interior is awesome  great view of brewing equipment  cool lighting in ball mason jars  and incredibly hand laid jenga like wooden inlay in the walls  tvs and a patio are also nice features  the bartender  stefan  was extremely personable and made great conversation with us  he made sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there  oh yeah  they muddle their drinks by hand  and that is just as cool as the beer  all of the drink menu looked quite refreshing  and again  i have made a point to try one next go round  giving it an overall 3 5 stars  simply because i need to go back again   
ordered delivery rather late on a friday  didnt seem to have the same late arrival issues that others have had  but i was also pretty close to this location    ordered an italian hero assuming it would be the bomb diggity  with lots of that salty herby spicy authentic flavor    it was alright  but the bread to meat and cheese ratio was skewed  more on the bready side  the meats are super thin sliced  which is fine  i just expected a lot more  provolone was very thin as well  and there were only a few half slices on my sandwich  hot cherry peppers and vinaigrette added flavor to an otherwise bland tasting sandwich    would like to try their other menu offerings sometime  but im in no hurry 
if i were to rate on just the food  i would have given it a solid 3  the spicy soup was flavourful and the variety of meats i was able to try seemed like standard hot pot food  they also serve cold lemon tea and prune juice at no extra charge    however  given the amount of times my friends and i have been to this restaurant  were were only able to get a selected range of food   not because we didnt want to order it  but because the order never came after multiple follow ups  the nice thing about this restaurant is that they give you order papers so you can mark want you want  and the staff will bring them to you  but  if you try to order a bunch of things at once  you will only get around half the food youve ordered  when you ask the staff where the rest of the food is  they will tell you they will bring it  but will often forget about you  even if the restaurant is practically empty  the service button they have is essentially useless because they never respond when we click it  the owner  manager always look disgruntled  and sounds bothered when we order food    i went a few times  hoping that the service will improve  sufficed to say  i will not be visiting again 
if you want a chance to dine at inspire  you definitely need to plan ahead and make a reservation during busy periods  i went once spontaneously on sunday and was told by the waitress that they were fully booked until 9 30pm  this restaurant serves incredible food for a good price  which might just be the reason why it became so popular    ive been to the restaurant once so far for lunch because many people were recommending the chicken waffles there  unfortunately  they did not serve that during lunch hours so i ended up getting the korean beef sandwich  which exceeded my expectations  the sandwich itself had great flavour  and they dont skimp out on the meat  i added a few dollars to upgrade my side to the pulled pork frites and it was worth every penny  the frites were cut thin and packed full of pork and other flavours that made it so delicious    overall  i had a good time at inspire restaurant  the place is small and quaint  great for date nights or with small group of friends  i will definitely go there for dinner and try out their dinner menu 
this family owned restaurant is the place to be if youre craving some good shwarma  oftentimes  i will go during lunch hours  and the place would be packed because thats just how good the food is  the place serves a variety of middle eastern meals  and all the ones ive tried delicious  service wise  all the staff are very friendly and attentive to your order  and they really dont skim out on the meat   both the beef and chicken shwarma wraps  plates are very flavourful  and portion size are pretty big for the price  they did recently increase the price of their menus items  which is understandable considering how popular they are  i highly recommend the shwarma poutine as well  as they fry the fries per order   highly recommend this place to anyone craving a good shwarma meal in markham 
plenty of space  good happy hour deals  plenty of parking  sushi was mediocre  we got the las vegas roll and the spicy tuna roll  the spicy chicken noodle bowl was really good  took a while to get water and the place wasnt busy at all 
omg omg omg  i cant believe no one has reviewed samosa king yet  this takeout  restaurant joint is like no other  where can you find mouth watering samosa in the city for  1 for 5  no its not a typo  thats right  5 for  1   so fresh and hot  right out of the deep fryer    the line up here can get ridiculous  so be prepared to stand in line for a bit  people come here mainly to take out food  samosas being a staple  obviously   but there is a small dining room section  more often then not empty       loyal customers buy samosas by the bag load  yet they never seem to run out  and if they do  a fresh batch is only a few minutes away  not only do they have samosas but they have other indian appetizers  such as pakoras  roti and other deep fried treasures that i dont know the names to  their indian desserts are plentiful too  unfortunately i dont have much of a palate for the richness     if that wasnt enough  they also have a take out meal section  hot plate  with dishes like malai kofta  buttered chicken  and all the other favorites   and a meal isnt a meal without good ol naan  a real steal of a find  and its a good sign when a lot of the clientele that go to samosa king are of indian decent 
5 stars for caynes   woot woot  this store lives up to its name  super houseware store it is  hardly a locale treasure  the parking lot to this place is something not to be desired  as it is always busy and full   a lot of cars park on the road  or in one of the adjacent lots    canyes has everything from bakeware  small kitchen appliances  cooking containers  bathroom and laundry equipment    the prices are really good  especially the weekly sale items   ive been shopping here for over 10 years  and its never let me down   the good thing about this store is that this is their only location  and they have a website  everything that you see on the website  you can go into the store and find it there  there have been many department stores where youll find something online and go into their store to buy it  only to find they dont have it in store    keep up the great job caynes 
somewhere out there  theres a manual written on building a suburban division and in that manual it says  erecting a costco wholesale is a must have      theres a reason why they dont have costcos in downtown toronto   because city folks dont have enough room in their 500sq ft condo to put all the oversize crap you buy at costos  48 roll toilet paper  cheese by the kilo  oversize cereal boxes etc    i love costco  and could never think of leaving it behind  everytime you go  its like an exciting venture  what new thing are they going to have  any good sales     ohhh ahhhhh   you can find some really good prices  such as on books  cheese  and fruits  veggies and meats    but there are things that you may as well buy at the grocery stores as the savings arent too big such as bottled water  or canned soup     just thought id pass on a little costco dom to you 
like the last reviewer  stumbled upon this place looking for a bar  its sorta strange  because this place is a pretty good location  with ryerson university  and dundas square around the corner   they really could do a lot with it  unfortunately  its not that great  from the outside  it looks like a cheap ass  old mans hangout  the bright neon lights and the dingy interior leave nothing to be desired   i cant really say anything else  its just not my place  i much rather go to milestones and order an overpriced mixed drink   
you dont see too many fast food thai places  they are just recently starting to pop up in fast food places in the gta   this malay thai place is in the first markham place food court  its one of a kind goodness   some of the dishes i recommend are the tom yum soup   you get a super big bowl  the roti with curry sauce   loves it  and the coconut rice   which i eat plain  i love coconut rice    as far as fast food is concerned  this place is pretty darn good  it beats spring rolls any day of the week 
i never had a great appreciation for this pond  probably because ive grown up with it my whole life  as ive ventured out and expanded my  parks  repertoire  i realized that this park is one of the most beautiful in the gta     the pond sits on a 33 acre land  in the winter  the pond is used  moreso in the past than now  as a skating rink   in the summer people go fishing in the pond or just admire its beauty     in the early fall is my favorite time to go because you can see all the different color foliage in all its glory   im a big suck for that   its also the time when mosquitoes are not present  they have been overstaying their welcome this year  thats for sure     for the most part  the path is not paved  so if you are planning a trip to the pond after a rainy day  be sure to bring the proper footwear  as it can get messy   bring stale bread and feed the birds  geese  or as my mom would say  gooses    just watch out for the bird poops     theres a fairly small parking lot that fills up fast in the summer  but theres plenty of free parking in the area   if youre visiting the pond  stop off at main street unionville for some ice cream and a lovely stroll down old unionville 
incredibly great pizza    wonderful sauce and superb crust   and we r picky pizza people from chicago  very reasonable prices    husband enjoyed sampling local craft beers and ditto for me on the wine  friendly and attentive server trish and owner roger are lovely people who make everyone including out of  town tourists feel welcome 
worst pedicure ive ever had   i walked out missing a dime sized chunk of my heel thanks to an inattentive uncaring  young tech wielding a cheese grater  its been a full week and i havent been able to wear any closed back shoes  my daughters pedicure was sloppy and the nail color was streaked  i went back in to complain to the manager  took 3 visits before he was at the shop and available  after seeing the infected mess on my heel he reluctantly refunded my pedicure fee but refused to do anything about the sloppy pedicure my daughter received  
my favourite indian place in toronto  ive been going here for years  although less frequently now because their prices have gone up   but  the dishes are amazingly flavourful  the palak paneer and butter chicken leave us wanting to lick the plates   everything ive tried here is delicious   its family run  which i like  the restaurant itself it cozy   the portions could be bigger  the prices could be lower 
hands down pink cherry is the spot    kaitlyn was such a sweetheart checking me in and checking me out  the atmosphere is very welcoming  glad i made the choice coming here  saw shaina for a brazillian wax  and i must say wow  very impressive  shaina expertise really made the experience very comfortable and made me feel at ease the whole time  i would definitely recommend this place without any hesitation  became a loyal customer at the first experience and look forward to many more brazillian waxes  and any other wax service i need   excited to tell my girlfriends all about it  because when you find great service  its hard not to share the experience 
they used to be one of the best in las vegas  i dont know if they have new management but the quality of service has degraded alarming fast  the produce looks horrible and the meat department is bare   i just waited 15 minutes at the hot food department till someone helped me and it is only noon  with so many choices to shop at they should  want to offer more to retain loyalty  hopefully they are just going through a change in leadership  dropped the ball today 
i cant help but compare this place to panera  i know they get alot of their ingredients from them and they have a lot of the same menu items   the restaurant itself is very big and inviting  perfect place to have lunch with a friend  the staff is sooooo friendly  great customer service   i ordered the roasted turkey avocado blt on sea salt focaccia which is what i always get from panera  compared to paneras though  it didnt taste as good for some reason  still good though  all sandwhiches come with a free cookie  which is cool but i like how you can get chips at panera  their sea salt kettle cooked chips are excellent    i got a chocolate chip macadamia cookie  it was pretty good   overall i would come back  because its in the area and the nearest panera is 20 mins from me  i prefer panera  but this is a good alternative 
this buffet has to be the best buffet ive been to here in las vegas  came to check it out because i didnt feel like cooking and my boyfriend plays poker at the m everyday  so my mother and i went to go meet up with him for dinner  went through the vip line  but the buffet is pretty small compared to all the others  so it took a while to get seated  they have a really good selection and variety  some out of the norm range like hawaiian   greek  to be honest  i do think it is over priced though  only reason why we came was because the boyfriend gets like 15  off or something for us and my mother gets free buffet comps all the time for here  but hey  if you have money to spend then go for it  im currently pregnant  so i didnt get to try the unl  beer   wine bar  but if your coming to get your drink on  then i guess you can say its decently priced  lol  the desert bar was amazing  my favorite was the crepes w   ice cream  they also have a barista so you can enjoy a cup of joe with your desert 
i love the atmosphere of this place  drink menu has some great craft cocktails and the bartenders really take the time to make it just right  they only have small plate options but they are really tasty  if you are super hungry  you might find yourself ordering several small plates  regardless a cool spot in south scottsdale  im sure they will pick up business as more and more people discover it 
this is my fav and the only restaurant that serve real taiwanese style hot pot in town  love the environment  friendly staffs  many varieties and the location is super easy to find  i would totally recommend to everyone   
company made a true effort to reach out to me for a free gift  but i missed the connection  stand up company for the effort 
some of the best french toast i have had  my girl loved her eggs benni  devin was attentive and funny  overall great experience
elevator system is a nightmare   their payment system also sucks really bad and managed to take my deposit on top of the full cost of the 2 night stay  it takes accounting nearly 3 days to correct this mistake  still waiting after 1    i would never book a room at this hotel again 
hello friends  i like this place when in the mood for some good bbq  my friend and i had the all u can eat menu with seafood  and it was good  but then again we did bbqed it ourselves   lol  service is decent and the price is ok  will come back again when i have a craving   peace 
dined in last sunday afternoon  around 1pm  for some dim sum with my family  i dont know if it was an off day but the service and product was lacking big time  for starters the restaurant wasnt completely full yet there was a wait  im assuming they didnt have enough servers to seat all the tables  it took about 15 minutes before the first cart came around     in the past theyve came around within minutes of being seated  they were limited to only 3 carts an entree cart bbq pork  rice  noodles   apps cart  pot stickers etc  and a soup cart   not only was the selection very limited but the carts barely came around  we never got to order a second round and thought it wasnt worth waiting around all day so we left hungry and extremely unsatisfied  top it off there was a line just to pay the check    really   i might give them one more chance only because its inconvenient to drive all the way to chinatown just to get some dim sum 
cant figure out all the negative reviews   its chinese takeout guys  aka home of the  10 lunch combo     not an authentic 5 star dining experience   i order dinner for my family here about once a month   they always remember me and even throw in some free spring rolls and fried noodles  we havent gotten sick once despite the other reviews   not the greatest but never a complaint     they deliver a consistent product at a very reasonable price and never had to wait longer than 15 minutes   ill be back 
one of the few chains that i frequent   they serve a good burger and the service is typically good  sometimes all we ask for is consistency and rr typically delivers   only had one incident here with a bad server and when i complained to corporate they sent me a gift card  problem diverted and they kept a loyal customer  will be back    like every month 
joncen was awesome  he did a wonderful job  from the beginning of the appointment i showed him pictures of colors that i wanted and he explained the process of obtaining the look i wanted in a realistic way  making sure that i knew it would take several visits before i could achieve my ultimate desired look  i appreciated his explanation and that he cared about making sure my hair was healthy and wouldnt become damaged from over processing   i told him what i did not want  and he gave me everything i wanted and more  i love how my hair turned out  the colors are gorgeous and he did a beautiful job trimming my hair too  joncen has great energy and he and kelly really made my appointment an enjoyable one 
absolutely worth it  probably the best filet mignon ive ever had  recommend the escargot for apps  great view of the strip  great service  outdoor patio dining was perfect  but interior was also really pretty 
awesome place  it was so good  i order the beef tenderloin steak it was perfect and they give us free dessert for my moms birthday and it was the most amazing dessert  our waitress was excellent  good service and food overall 
took a date night in pittsburgh over the holidays   made a reservation for 2 a week in advance  which was a good thing because the place was booked solid   after getting very good cocktails at the bar  sloe gin fizz and glenshaw sour  we were seated at exactly 7p   not a big restaurant   its one big room  high ceilings  with the bar at the center and tables around the edges and had a nice lively feel     draft list was on a chalkboard on the wall  and had some great seasonal and local selections   only special was the mussels of the day  which looked good but were not mussels people   started with pate  which was an ample portion  and the seasonal salad  both hit the spot   lamb burger was good sized and excellent   korean reuben could have used a little more kimchi since it really did go well with the corn beef  but it was an interesting and enjoyable  and large  sandwich   couldnt even finish all the french fries served with each sandwich since we wanted dessert   we went with gingerbread cake which was fresh and delicious but we couldnt help thinking it would have been better after 10 seconds in a microwave   they brought it with a candle since we were celebrating my husbands birthday   service was professional and friendly and the server was helpful with beer and food selections   we were happy with the prices we paid which were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what we got   we are partial to gastropubs in general and this was a very good one   would recommend to anyone to try 
the absolute best pho   my sister and i have lunch dates here once a week  never had a bad bowl  service is always fast and friendly 
great new patio     almost triples their outdoor seating     and as always   great taps      my husband and i go on thursdays because they have a cheeseburger special and we can always get a great draft
came with a groupon       left with a good impression   the ruben was nice with the sauce on the side   the boom boom shrimp was very tasty   the waitress nice prompt and very friendly and explained the dishes   it is a pub  bar and we will be back 
yay detroit coney grill listens to their customers  sliced beets on the greek salads  great service great food   
fairytale brownies were amazingly professional and went above and beyond to try and make good for me as an unhappy customer   their service is unparalleled that is certain   i received a replacement batch of what i had ordered   this time there was more carmel in the carmel brownies  more chocolate chips in the chocolate chips  etc but i confess as much as much as i wanted to love them it really wasnt it for me   i still think they need to be more moist but the company is clearly top notch and i am sure they will hammer it all out   i really cannot express enough how impressed i was with the customer service   this matter was handled back in 2009 and i just never got around to making the update so i hope their product has improved to match the quality of their staff and the rest of their business 
a great gem just outside of madison  incredible food  great service  hilarious bartender  we will definitely return 
did  good fixed our car took care of the 500 dollars qwsome casey his name was rental car came and picked us up no problem thanks will recommend this place  
i think the words that would best describe my initial reaction when first coming here would be   holy crap this place is huge      i came here for the consumer electronics show in early january and  for an event like that  the lvcc is the perfect venue to showcase all of the various booths and such both big and small   it was a good thing we were there for three days since it would have been impossible to try and explore everything in one day  that  and there were a few things that kept us distracted for most of our time there      as with any convention center  i steered far away from the food court and their  4 not so good hot dog and everything else thats overpriced  yay for bringing lunch     it was also difficult to find a restroom in such a huge hall  make that three separate halls  the south  center  and north halls    i just remember lots and lots of walking    and also having to wait in the longs lines for the shuttles back to the hotel and the large masses of shuttles trying leave all at once  i would not have tried to drive here    no one in their right mind should do it  anyway    though  lvcc does its job in being huge and holding a variety of events throughout the year   it does take some preparation and a lot of patience in trying to find your way around so keep that in mind if you have to come here for an event 
would like to move in  dont know why my curtains dont automatically open and lights turn on when i walk into my living room at home  still looking for the  goodnight  button next to my bed in my house to shut everything down and close the curtains to black out mode  im pretty sure angels were singing when i walked into my aria room    seriously  that was one of the nicest hotels ive ever stayed in  love that its leed gold  and that my room was energy efficient  loved the wallpaper throughout the hallways  the lighting fixtures  and the wallpaper  was it leather of some sort   in the elevator bays  every detail was divine  yet simple  aria also has the least smoky of all the casinos on the strip  in my opinion  and i do appreciate that  i just want to go to there  often 
i just turned 18 and was ready to go get my first piercing alone  i went to halo because of their natural jewelry and was amazed  i wasnt encouraged to just get whatever  even though it would have brought in money  i was cautioned against a lip or eyebrow ring for professional purposes and given really good information about what i wanted done  when i finally did get pierced  i got the procedure done for free because it was my birthday and i went into a very clean room  with ana  who is absolutely fabulous  she did a great job of putting me at ease  and i barely felt a thing  halo is just such a great place if you want a good piercing  the piercing prices arent too expensive  its the jewelry thats a little costy  but the value and quality is unbeatable  halo is awesome 
you know you hit the jackpot at an ethnic restaurant when you are a minority   i had the pork belly tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos   very good   very fresh   we had a good seat   right next to the kitchen and we were able to see all the food going out to the tables   it all looked good   come with a big appetite and you will leave happy and full 
im picky about who cuts my hair and first impressions are a must   here are my requirements   you have to think  outside the box   you have to have tats and finally  i have to walk out there feeling fabulous   and guess who fulfilled all my expectations   ashley   i love my haircut and i love ashley   she came as a recommendation from a very good friend   she and i have completely different types of hair and im always a little concerned when i go to someone new  but ashley  you over achieved   thank you    the saloon itself is a super cool place and i agree with a previous yelper  and dont let the north scottsdale location scare you away   well technically  it isnt north scottsdale since the salon is on the southside of shea 
pricey  but great drinks  love the vibe  raspberry rose was fantastic    definitely recommend  a great place to just relax and hangout 
wait staff was great  drinks were not  for the price  the drinks could have been much better  i ordered 3 different drinks and while two were ok  one was horrible  same for my husband  its also pretty obnoxious that the staff is yelling at you to come in  i get promoting but having four people covering about 30 feet of space was too much 
i sent my daughter in law breakfast from talebu through grubhub  it was her birthday and i asked that the delivery person wish her a happy birthday  im so impressed that the staff took the time to decorate the container of her croissant and her coffee cup   she said the food and drink were outstanding   what a great experience in every way  thank you for making both our days  
3 5 stars in terms of flavor   fish had a nice thin crispy tempura like batter    stayed crisp throughout the meal even though it was humid  i would have like the fish to be more seasoned   the flavor relief solely on the 2 sauces you get  fries were nice and crisp   everything eat dinner well    but the legend makes you expect mind blowing every time    which is maybe unfair  service was a little slow and not enough seating  one of the servers could be friendlier even when the customer is at fault 
i want to spend at least one night a month drinking and watching great bands in this theatre   great venue   cheap drinks   cool crowd 
this review wont be long  lol  over priced   good decor and people   very loud  have to almost yell at your server during dinner time   fun activities   interesting restrooms   parking sucks and must valet  would return when i have another  100 to waste  and i only ordered mussels and several drinks for the wife and i   how does fox get away with these prices   all his establishments are over priced and people love it for some reason  must be the new hipster age and no concept of the value of money 
fair prices  quality work  customer service could be better but you get into that kind of business to work not to talk to customers   id recommend hiring a front desk person to answer phones and make appointments  family just doesnt always cut it   i had a leather seat bottom replaced and the only issue was they broke the plastic cover plate at the lumbar support button without telling me  drove off and noticed a day later when it came off  my fualt for not detail checking the work  other than that seat is holding up and looks great 
i dont really know what this is  but it certainly isnt mediterranean  the service is awful  but the food is even worse  we walked in because it sounded healthier than other options around  there are several things awful about this place  i will list them   1  instead of using pita bread  they used a stale  old torilla   2  the food came cold  not room temperature cold  fridge cold   3  everything was smothered in some weird tasteless reddish brown sauce  they tried to tell me that it is tahini sauce  4  when i took the food back and told them it was awful and that i wasnt going to eat it  they tried to tell me that the food was cold because the vegetables were  fresh   i explained that the chicken too was cold  the owner just stared at me  i said i wasnt going to eat it  and they continued staring at me  didnt offer a refund  didnt offer to make something else  didnt offer to warm it up or to remake it  nothing   5  rude service  terrible  terrible  terrible food  like seriously  the worst ive ever head 
hireawiz team are awesome   knowledgeable    helpful and great costumer service if you are  looking for a web design company in phoenix or seo company just give them a call and you will thank me   they helped us with our website graphic design   gave us free tips on how we can save money and do some stuff ourselves  and the most important it worked for us to get more leads     thank you
los taquitos have great food   i love the food there  always fresh   taste great and nice portion and amazing green and smoky red salsas    the 3 stars is for the 3rd time they made a mistake on my pick up order they gave me wrong food and i found out about that only when i got home i didnt double check because they  double checked  i would of give them 2 stars for this kinda service but i really love the food there but after 3 times i just had to leave this review so customers will double check their pick  up orders and the stuff working will actually double check   its just annoying to get home and find out that you have to drive back again  
got here at 11 15am today for brunch  the cashier told us that its gonna be a 15 20 minute wait and since we were hungry and didnt wanna go anywhere before my friends flight  we opted to wait    i ordered a breakfast waffle and iced coffee  while my friend ordered a smoothie  latte and west coast wafflewich  11 45 and still no food or drinks  the place was packed and theres only 3 employees  1 cashier and 2 food prep staff    since it was already 12 00  we decided to take our food to go  coffee was okay  nothing special  the waffle was crisp and crunchy which was good  breakfast wafflewich was delicious but needs a little maple syrup  which we didnt get to have anymore bec we took the food to go  prices are reasonable    ill think about whether giving this place another try  otherwise  they should add more staff 
lack of authenticity  an unimaginative beachhead of white gentrification in an otherwise diverse toronto neighbourhood  bar neon offers a crew of white servers  serving up mediocre food in one of torontos last creative peripheries  i went in and was disappointed by the beer selection but excited by the food  its your classic millstreet menu and the same series of cocktails you find everywhere with zero imagination   dark and stormy anyone  i had the cider  good  i had the burger with salad  a bit of a rip off  17 50 for under ripened lettuce and a burger that was nicely coloured inside but completely singed on the outside  it came complete with that delectable burnt flavour  no extra charge  i wasnt asked how anything was until the end and the burger was a mayo covered mess  the bun seemed to have an identity crisis  unsure of what sort of bread it was trying to be  pita  yeastless catastrophe    anyway  very disappointing food  drinks  and just not reflective of the neighbourhood whatsoever  the sort of place that is pandering instead of being  a complete lack of authenticity 
best place to get tires in charlotte  quick and professional everytime and i have been coming here for over 5 years at least they will also meet others prices if lower 
i look on yelp for a good spot for a   sushi   bar  i tried different ones in the area around central   camelback  i came here because they had really good reviews on yelp  and all i can say is they are on point  love the location and great sushi  prices were good 2 6 mon sat  i will for sure be coming back a lot  tony the head chef was hella cool  this will be my  spot   
we dropped the car off and got an estimate of about  900 for the repair which i approved  the next day they called and let me know that the issue was not as bad as initially thought and it ended up being  260 including an oil change  the honesty of cars is refreshing  i can recommend them without any reservation 
im actually giving new generation sushi a 3 5  5  but yelp doesnt enable users to do that   surprisingly  this is one of my go to and almost favorite japanese restaurant  their food is quite decent  and i mean that honestly    its not cheap food court nor its not too high end  the staff are always so friendly and professional  although the ambiance and interior is fair  while also showing signs of age  please dont get confused between this restaurant and the second new generation sushi  now new generation fusion grill  located across the street   thank goodness they changed the name    finally  it was quite confusing and redundant  but i digress    overall  if youre looking for a decent  reasonably priced japanese food and good service  new generation is on my almost favorite list     disclaimer i came here on a friday night after 8 30pm dinner so your experience may vary
if youre tired of eating pho  then try the surprisingly simple yet satisfying yunan style rice noodle soup at oriental rice noodles    you are served a tray full of various ingredients   chicken  veggies  quail egg  edamame  rice noodles and a steaming bowl of light broth to incubate all your food  the broth was one of the tastiest ive ever had and the rice noodles were so invitingly soft and chewy  everything was just sooo good    there will likely be a line up  so be prepared to wait some time before getting seated  but once you get inside  youll be greeted with unique wall art of yunan culture  from there  service was also quick and friendly 
missed my connecting flight at charlotte to alabama for work which meant that i was stranded in the airport for 4 extra hours  irritated  i patrolled up and down the food court area looking for something to calme me down  as i walk on out  the smell of bbq wafts over   ordered the chicken and ribs combo with mashed potatoes and cornbread  though im still curious about the brisket      in any case  the ribs were a bit dry but they fell off the bone and the bbq sauce helped  the flavor   i couldnt tell for sure  but it seemed like a liquid smoke flavor rather than genuine wood coal  bbq  the chicken was tender and moist which disappeared to mear bones in no time   all in all  not the best bbq ive had  but it is definitely worth hitting up when youre stranded in layover hell 
we come here at least once a week and then the service has been getting more bad every time  twice weve waited for our server to bring us napkins   refills for over 10 minutes  i really wish i was exaggerating  i do see them just hanging around and it really is a bummer because i loved coming here to eat     update  i always eat at the bar now  fernny and madeline are awesome  they know our order and everything is always on when they serve us  they always greet us by name and chat with us 
hidden gem in charlotte if you arent looking for the next big thing  a neighborhood staple since 1947  no matter if you are looking for wholesome breakfast  lunch specials or delicious dinner fare there is plenty to please  feel good about supporting locally owned businesses  greystone is a family business and has been since it was founded  you will often find the owner around the bar  i really enjoy the gyro with home made tzatziki sauce  grecian tips  or home made wings  daily drink specials and the kitchen is open until 11pm  every sunday game too  what more could you want 
stayed here on 12  29  2015  first off  the parking situation was really bad  we had to park in the far end parking lot which is about a 1  4 mile from the hotel lobby  second  they put us in the wrong room  so we complained and they reluctantly switched us to a non smoking room  they acted like they were doing us a favor for the switch  third  we were woken up twice in the morning  once at 8 00am and again at 10 50am by guests who were incorrectly  booked in our room   fourth  upon leaving the elevators were not working   we had to haul our luggage down 22 flights of stairs to finally exit onto the 1st floor roof only to be greeted by an unfriendly security guard that told us we needed to have more patience with the elevators  after dealing with the rude employee we preceded  to exit the first floor roof down a flight of stairs  keep in mind  we had no idea where we were going   us and other guest thought wed end up stuck on the roof  wow  this was by far the worst hotel experience i have ever had  we complained to management  and in return they graciously paid our resort fee of  30 00 lol 
if you need compression stockings and cannot find a store that sells your size go shopping here   they measure your legs and custom order compression stockings 
never go there  they kept my car way too long  nothing was resolved and i am out of over  2000  i took my car to the dealership  the problem was solved in the same day and i had my car back the next day and most of the repair costs were covered under warranty   i dont usually write reviews but this experience was very frustrating  inconvenient  and very expensive 
the last time i was in dallas  i wanted to try this place out but the wait for it was insane so we left  glad i was finally able to try it out while i was vacationing in las vegas  the restaurant is inside of the linq hotel on second floor  we arrive at about 8 30am and our wait time was about 45min  on our way house about about 10 30 the line was double from when we got there  that alone should tell you how awesome this place is   luckily we took a look at the menu while waiting because there was definitely alot of options too choose from   our server was nice and was attentive to us even when they were slam busy  all of our dishes were amazing  we order the banana foster french toast  chicken and waffle  fried green tomato  and corn beef hash  all were huge portions  the chicken was fried and season to perfection  it had a perfectly crisp batter  the waffle itself was a little dry and i think that was our only complaint  all the entrees were flavorful and i wish they would open a location in new orleans  it was so hard to choose which one was my favorite because they were all that good 
love eating at maxwells   they have a great ribeye sandwich that is hard not to get every time   good salads  burgers  and fries   the only negative is usually a wait 
these guys are great to work with  tom  sean and keesha are all about customer service and responsiveness  highest recommendation 
i have been going to k land nail salon through three different owners now   this new owner is rude to his workers   i am not sure if they will continue with opi products because he was unloading cheap product in his store   having his children in the store is very un professional   i love children but i pay good money to get my nails done to relax 
unfortunately  this company proved to be yet another who schedules an appointment and never shows up  i called and set up an appointment for an estimate for biweekly services  the gentlemen advised that his crew would be there between 7am and 9am on wednesday morning  low and behold  no call  no show  lovely  why is it so tough to find a reliable yard maintenance company  eeeek 
i was quite impressed with the numerous switchbacks and grid of electricity towers on the side of the road as we approached the new bridge   bordering nevada and arizona  the new bridge across from the hoover dam is an impressive structure that provides another way to access nv from az    we did not try walking across the new bridge  but there are stairs that allow access to this  about 50 steps  and are a bit steep   there is a parking structure beside the dam that charges a  7 fee   this allows you to walk across the old bridge  do a bit of shopping at the store  or have a meal at the high scaler cafe     just another option on how to spend half a day in lv without hitting the casinos 
this place was recommended by an uncle who frequents vegas and likes finding culinary gems off the beaten bath   four stars to kj kitchen for getting cantonese cuisine  almost  right   we visited a bit before 7pm and were lucky enough to get a table  quick set up in 1 minute  felt like i was in restaurant wars or something    the clientele is mostly asian  always a sure sign that the food is good because it passes muster with the people familiar with the cuisine   traditional chinese decor greets you on entry   the mandatory red altar by the door  the aquariums at the entrance to signify the flow of water  heck  they even house live fish too sometimes   three chinese gods feng shui cally  placed on the corner diagonally from the entrance  golden buddha on the cashiers counter     we were out of luck as the rockfish was not available   other items on the menu that caught our eye included deer with black mushrooms  duck toungue with xo and maggie sauce  salted fish maw with shrimp  and frog legs in clay pot   not feeling that adventurous  we decided on going for the familiar and got the salted pepper pork  3 stars  hkg bbq and dimsum does it better   honey walnut shrimp  3 stars  sam woo does it better   and roasted duck  4 stars  perfectly crisped skin and delicious sauce     tea and white rice are free   priced so it wont break your wallet   late night dining is available from 10pm to 2am  perfect after a night of clubbing    and make sure you ask for the special  chinese  menu that we found out about after we placed our order   bummer 
great neighborhood  great little divey place  and good food at great prices  i play basketball at the hoops courts down in the run and often will stop by big jims afterward to get some much needed sustenance    the portions are huge and almost everything is good  the last time i was there i got the reuben and it did not disappoint  stacked high with meat and good tasting and i think it was only around 8 dollars    the service at the bar isnt all that attentive  but by no means is poor  it is exactly what you would expect at a place like this  if you are looking for a fancy night out this surely isnt the place  but it is absolutely perfect for what it is  cheap food and drinks in huge portions 
steelers fans love it  well mostly because they are steelers fans  therefore  when they review heinz field most of them in a way are reviewing the steelers  sure they are going to give 5 stars to where their favorite team plays   im not a steelers fan so i will try to be objective  ive been to a number of pro and college stadiums and heinz field field is just ok  thus the 3 stars    its way too open  and though steelers fans get very loud  it doesnt get close to as loud as old three rivers used to be  the turf is bad  i love how they want to keep the real grass  but when the steelers  the panthers  and the entire wpial championships are played there the grass just cant hold up and it turns into a mud bowl  its really time to lay the fancy new synthetic field turf like many of the other stadiums   and for a college football venue  it really sucks  terrible college atmosphere mostly because its 3 miles from campus and all the students have to bus in  but in order to have a beautiful basketball stadium pitt had to get rid of old pitt stadium and play their games at heinz  so i understand pitts decision to play here 
came for dinner on saturday and were not given a table  there were many seats open but we were told we couldnt get a table because  you wont get to eat   apparently they are under staffed 
have brought my son twice  so far he enjoys it  instructors seem to care about the kids and  in pushing them to succeed  feel they need more  organization in the class  some of the students seem to feel they can do what they want  instructor does bring them back into focus  but this is a serious sport  needs to be shown the respect that it has earned 
i recently bought a honda accord from metro motors and was very satisfied with the experience   all of my questions were answered and i was in and out the door in no time   the price was very fair and i definitely recommend metro to anyone looking to buy a car 
i went with my sister and some friends  we had so much fun  we are already planning our next visit  we did the sugar skulls and at first it was difficult but our instructor encouraged us it was going to look great in the end 
staff is really nice but if you order catfish expect to go home with swai  also sweet potatos was very mushy  my cornbread was also very dry  this store has so much going on inside  i wanted to be supportive  but the food is just not good or even decent 
i wanted to like this place so bad  i live very close by i been a few times and each time its a hassle unless the older guy is there usually in the mornings during week hes really sweet and welcoming this place has really bad customer service if the older lady is there she just stares at you as if your going to steal  theres a younger guy whos tall looks to be in his 30s who yelled out loud at me for bringing a child into the store he claimed children couldnt enter and his parents owned the store   ive been in several times with a child no one has ever said anything to me  even if so why yell or talk to customer that way  overall drink selection is mediocre and some items are over priced  if you have time i say travel further down to wine and spirits  the selection is better and the customer service is way better 
amazing service   terri the manager is beyond awesome  shes been cutting my hair for some time   the people there are nice and the place is always clean 
so  i was a regular at this place  this post has nothing to do with quality of food  but everything to do with mannerism and customer service  i went to lunch today with my buddy and ordered hamburger patty loco moco and one to go for my husband  i cant consume large quantities of food at one time so i decided to get a to go container for mine  my husbands food was in a plastic bag and mines was sitting under his  when i left  i only grabbed the bag leaving my food by accident  now  i can deal with them just say there was nothing they could do to replace it  but to go as far as saying  if you want us to get it out of the trash for you we will   i found that statement insulting and disrespectful  my thoughts are   if you talk to people that way that spend their hard earned money at your establishment really says a lot about how you feel about your customers  i will never eat here again  i never was disrespectful to them  all i asked is  was there anyway they could replace it or maybe discount it  or ill pay for a smaller portion  mind you they said they kept it 20 minutes  i dont even live 20 minutes away 
weve ordered togo from here a few times and a handful of those times something was missing or something was wrong with our order  but every time we have dined in with them it has been great  we are not a fan of there salad dressing but i liked the fettuccine alfredo and the pizza is good 
the wife and i have been going here since they first opened  tony and mike make it look easy 
the food here is good and reasonably healthy   i ordered scallops and broccoli with a side of fried rice   my lunch was lean and delicious   the service was very good   both employees i dealt with were kind and helpful   great  inexpensive place to go to lunch with coworkers 
as a child  i remember frequenting the winn dixie that once stood where grand asia market in stallings stands today   unoccupied for many years  grand asia market utilized the vacated space to launch an asian grocery store as well as a restaurant one third the size of the facility   their inventory runs deeps and their prices are surprisingly affordable   their fish market offers an assortment of live and frozen fish including lobster and some obscure species   remarkably  the prices of their frozen fish were very low  some as low at  2 50  lb   i do wonder if the quality of their fish is relative to the price   the store and restaurant are clean and decorated   i can really appreciate the culture at grand asia market  its almost as though ive stepped over a continental border   follow up  i ate at their in store restaurant today   it was quite good  just a bit on the salty side   my order of sesame chicken came to about  7   i plan to return very soon   grand asia market is closed on mondays 
i used to like this restaurant but lately the food is not consistent sometimes fair sometimes not so we look for other places to eat
t j max used to be my favorite store to buy clothes for the whole family  but lately as everything else  things changed  quality is not the same and prices too  customer service is not bad  so i still go there once in while for some things 
was in the mood for some montreal style smoked meat  given that i travel between toronto and ottawa frequently we  wife and i  always try to make it to montreal for the smoked meat at our regular spot   on this occasion we were searching for a similar experience although we had no expectations that it would be of the same calibre as schwartzs   we decided on the reuben and smoked meat sandwich with the coleslaw and fries  a few things to mention   the sandwiches tasted great  the smoked meat sandwich is not as juicy or fatty   or as good  when compared with schwartzs but was certainly a great sandwich  the reuben however stole the show with its flavour  they were both large sandwiches packed with meat and the coleslaw and fries went well with it  go for the larger sandwich that comes with the slaw and fries   a great deal   our server was friendly and helped with suggestions for us and also suggested i try the  old style  reuben next time which im looking forward to   ambiance is nice enough   no frills or fancy decor but then thats not what youre there for  its clean  the service is great  and the meal wont burn a hole in your wallet  we made it halfway through our sandwiches before we were full  and will definitely go back    anticipate spending 15 20 per head and having a very filling and great tasting sandwich 
this place was awesome   my husband and i recently moved into the area and happily stumbled upon this gem  great food  good beer selection  friendly staff  now a regular spot for us  get there 
honestly  i feel that this practice gouges their customers    they gave me an estimate a week ago  but when i took my daughters in to have the work done  suddenly the bill was tripled of what the estimate that they gave me was   i understand a little more  but tripled     i have never paid so much before to have a couple of fillings done     1 100 00 later    and that is after insurance paid their part  we will be returning to our old dentist   and i dont know if it was just a coincidence  but they didnt tell me the bill was going to be tripled the estimate until after they had already given my children the sedative  and so i said never mind  this is not what you estimated me  we will just leave  and they said they didnt want me to leave because they had already sedated my children  so i was stuck with going through with it and paying triple the price i was originally told       but i do have to say that they are good with kids  thats the only good thing i can say about my experience   
i gotta say    i wasnt that impressed with this place   very overpriced and had a lot of funky items on their menu  yes  yes  im aware that is what fusion is all about  and i didnt really care for the  family style  presentation of the food  plus  this restaurant is very noisy    forget about having a private conversation because youll find yourself yelling across the table at your dinner companion   the wait staff was very friendly  as was the front hostess 
ive gone to dr  zimmerman for botox  artefill  cool sculpt and i have been very happy with the results of every single one of them   dr  z is extremely knowledgeable in his craft and will tell a patient if he feels a certain procedure isnt warranted   the nurses are very professional but also make you feel at ease and ive never had any issues whatsoever   ive read some of these negative reviews and when youre dealing with an industry that deals with people who are unhappy about their appearance  there will always be that one customer who will never be happy with their appearance no matter what they do   i would highly recommend dr  z if you are looking to improve your appearance  regardless of age 
this is a great place to stay in the chandler area   however  a few caveats  if you have a room with a connecting door  you can hear the person in the next room through the door  also  my room faced the basketball court where the ball was occasionally bouncing sometimes late into the night   the hallways are a bit sterile and could use some artwork  and foxnews was usually playing in the lobby every morning  i guess its hard to find a neutral cable news channel these days   the positives are that the staff is friendly and helpful  all areas of the hotel clean and safe  and the rooms are very comfortable  there are two flat screen televisions    one in your bedroom and one in the kitchen    and the free breakfasts and dinners are convenient  the dinners included shock top beer and california wine  theres also a pool  and the hotel is close to the nearby shopping mall  a public golf course  and a variety of restaurants  bars 
beautiful view of the strip  expensive drinks  and okay music   20 to get in and needs to be 21 years old  they personally view the id and use a machine to scan your id  by expensive drinks i means that a bud light is  7  i imagine other drinks would be more expensive but all i got was a bud light  overall  i had fun but other vegas clubs can deliver more 
as a college student  i have been trying hard to find a place to study whenever i am for breaks  i am always at the library at school so thats the last place i want to go to if i am home  finally theres a solution  its this place    i like how the atmosphere is really open  right when you walk in you see people on their computers and they even have a long table with a set of power outlets for students to plug in their macs and go    the food here is pretty good too  the green tea i got was smooth and inexpensive  the apple tort was delicious but on the pricey side  i live near anthem and i drove all this way to see if it was a good place to do work  i chugged out my paper and used the rest of my time to write this review and start doing other stuff   the lighting is bright and the environment is conducive to either chill out with friends or read a book on your own  they even have an upstairs loft area that i have yet to check out  definitely will be using this place from now on as a hang out 
as soon as we got there this man treated us like king and quen  this man loves and loves the people who go there    best man ever    his name is william but i called him charlie  and always answered with a smile      best place ever
wow  i have been ordering lunch delivery for years spending  250 per occasion   my attendees love chic fil a   suddenly they decided to raise the limit to  300 minimum for a delivery   very disappointing   i guess they must be doing well enough to not want my business   hope the other locations have not followed same protocol   i spend about  1500 per month at chic fil a valley wide   sorry for your decision 
what rip off              162 dollars for a battery charging case my 6plus and then he said i give you the screen protector free          found everything on amazon for less then 100 bucks
absolutely wonderful company and people to deal with  we appreciated and took their suggestions on materials and options  the blinds are fantastic and we will use them again  many thanks for a very pleasant and easy experience 
this is an okay place if you want to grab a quick bite but not anything more than that   i was very disappointed by their holiday turkey sandwich   i was thinking it would be like capriottis  the bobby  but thats what i get for thinking     
i highly recommend lvcc  they go above and beyond to make sure that your car is taken care of  my car was in an accident and when i received it back it looked even better than before  if thats possible   i am so pleased with the job they did  quality of service and timelessness  thank you 
i had the please working with craig kagel this month and was extremely impressed   he transformed my resume from mediocre to extremely excellent   he took his time to get a good understanding of my job history and my career goals   i am beyond blown away by my resume and cover letter   i am looking forward to receiving numerous calls from potential employers   thank you craig   regards   tiffany collins
great spot to meet up with friends   lovely environment   extremely friendly service  drinks are elegant   refreshing  appetizers were delightfully displayed on our table  almost too perfect to eat    amazing night out   
my family   i are extreme sea food lovers  coming from the south  i know what a craw fish boil should taste like  absolutely never eating here again    you could see the disappointment on everyones face  our server also clocked out   failed to mention we would have to flag someone else down for the bill  no no no
love this place  reasonably priced and everyone is friendly  brought my girls here for a girls day and we all got manicures  i go for pedicures as well as my eyebrows  it really is a one stop shop  highly recommended 
this is an old family favorite   if you are an old las vegas then you already know  they were around before most people knew what a taco was in las vegas   chips and salsa are my favorite there  and the mini chimichangas   not the most authentic flavor  but still great 
they have vegan schnitzel     idk how   but i was happy  loved the food drinks atmosphere and shots  peter gave me and my girlfriends the business when we got paddled  omg my butt has a mark  im such a wimp   everything is great only down side is price  for three girls thats one beer two rum drinks three vodkas three shots tequila and three entrees  it was 144 dollars  i guess thats to expect in vegas  probs should have avoided the tequila  other than that liked it  will be back  just no more paddling  lol
so my first time here i was walking by and just went in and made appointments for a week later  i got a facial from melissa  it was amazing  however if you get a facial and u get some extractions give your skin a few days to breathe with no makeup and keep you alone clean for best results  i give my facial five stars   after my facial came my hair  i can no longer afford to be blonde  being blonde is expensive  i just cant justify spending hundred and hundreds on it  according to my stylist i was a level 12 blonde which means i was beyond bleach blonde platinum  she took me  to my natural color and lift some blonde in for highlights  took hours but perfection cant be rushed   she brought my natural hair color back with highlights  looks great going to save me a ton of money ill post a pic on here so you see the change   ended up spending  290 00 total for hair and facial and tips  well worth it  i recommend to anyone looking to enjoy an upscale salon experience with no snobiness  sara did my hair melissa did my facial they even have a small boutique inside with cute clothes
five star service from the time i sat down til i left  we had an incredible dinner tonight  we ordered from their plant based menu  vegan menu   plenty of great options to choose from will be back soon  
this was so good  food on point  we had a meat sampler with brisket  pork  and couple other meats  it was a little pricey but worth the money  it was packed so we had to sit at the middle table that had very uncomfortable chairs  the waiter was cool and very informative on our food choices  he let us sample a apple moonshine drink they had that was good  would def come back again  nice and clean bathrooms and other areas  old town scottsdale has amazing food  hands down 
this has to be the worst lowes ive ever been in   totally clueless about customer service   slowest checkout lines ive seen   a smile now and then would be nice too 
bouncers took away drinks because they claimed girls in our party with happy hour wristbands gave drinks away  when we paid for em with cash 
i really like coming here when it comes to karaoke  my friends always come around  the place is rather packed  and the sound system is awesome  lastly  the workers are very good in keeping tabs on who needs to be assisted when needed  i cant wait to go tonight 
the people who answer the phones when you call for a reservation need customer service training  horribly    i was given conflicting information from them and my hotel on where pick up is  the lady i spoke to told me to hold on while she tried to ask a colleague my question     instead of putting me on hold  she practically yelled in my ear speaking to her colleague  she then told me that there is only one level i need to be one for pickup  i told her i understood  but that there are two entrances on this level  she then said    i dont know  i guess the hotel would know better     not helpful at all     now i understand why this company has such horrible reviews 
darlene is so sweet and did a fantastic gel manicure  she has many glittery shimmery colors in up to date colors she was very friendly and helped me to pick out the perfect color  i love my nails  it was easy to book an appointment with her she texted me back right away this is an awesome find 
these people are awesome  always straight forward and upfront about what theyre selling  helping you with  ive had 2 insurance claims now that have really saved my bacon  and the insurance process is pretty lengthy but nothing too crazy  their recommendations are insightful and theyre eager to point you to other businesses like ubreakifix just down the street for reasonably priced phone fixes   mike and melissa have now both helped me and are awesome  mike two years ago helped me get back up and running after my phone was stolen  and melissa literally sat with me for 50 minutes as i tried to cancel insurance through geek squad  which is awful f y i   so i could save over  90 on an insurance claim  just cant explain how well they have treated me here  its super appreciated you two  seriously 
i know little and less about bicycles other than how to put air in them and use them  and these people are great  super helpful and honest about what you need it seems  but time will tell  so far so good though 
sewell was so accommodating   he met me on location and replaced my windshield on site while in a lunch meeting   also made sure the glass used was of factory quality as  the last company used a lesser quality brand which increased the noise levels in my car   my car is my office about 85  of the time so thats important   best in the business is my rating 
i got a pepperoni pizza and it was definitely good  i also order a chicken parm hoagie and it was alright  ive had better  but definitely going to keep ordering delivery from here 
just had the breakfast burger and it was amazing  great service all around from the bar where i sat to the cute server that also came over to make sure we were taken care of
very good portions for  8  the soup stayed hot throughout my entire meal which i really enjoyed    the soup is very flavourful   i got the spicy and sour soup and my boyfriend got the spicy pickled pepper soup   both delicious   the spicy pickled pepper soup is rather spicy so be careful is you are not good with spicy food    we ordered a cold dish and a snack   too much food for 2 ppl  tbh     the staff there is very friendly and attentive    the place is very clean  which is an important feature for me    i highly recommend you to check it out if you enjoy hot pot and ramen noodles   this place is like a mash up of it    it gets pretty busy during lunchtime 
we didnt want to drive downtown so we found this place down the street  the place is fairly decent on the smoke factor  but this is vegas so everyone should be used to it  lol   the chivas   water was solid and theyve got guinness on tap so thats always a plus   two pool tables are always a good time to spend with family 
customer service is so great here  food is good  went here twice on our vacation to las vegas  brought a few people with me and they loved it as well  suprised the staff walked around asking customers if they needed anything  they also refilled our drinks  didnt expect that from a fast place  a must go to if you love burgers and great staff 
it was a beautiful experience  the minister was so nice  prices are affordable and the chapel looks beautiful  you came pick with the chapel inside or the gazebo 
i had a great experience with unionville appliance   neville repaired my whirlpool dryer  with an experienced assessment of the product function  electronics and parts   after testing the various components  he explained the problem  and replaced the part     neville clearly explained the invoice charges  and also gave me some advice about my washing machine as well   my neighbour uses unionville appliance too    a company i would use again for sure  for any repairs or parts 
if you go on the weekend  prepare for a wait  weekdays are quieter  the place is small and simply furnished  but service is good and the food is exceptional  great value too  they really do have the best pancakes  waffles and biscuits and gravy in the akron area  this is a locals haunt and our absolute favorite breakfast spot 
im not that big on middle eastern food   however this is the best ive had   the portions are humungous  i like this place and it has a cool patio    my experience was supreme at the gerrard street location    they deserve a 5   however  the bloor street location had a very rude staff that deserves a 1 star    so when i average both out   they get a 3 from me 
these businesses change owners faster than disposable contact lenses     i had a great experience when reg was the owner   however he sold it to someone else   they ceased regular canada post services and only forwarded using ups   plus they charge a service fee for that too     then when my box came up for renewal  the spiked the rent by 1  3  33     me thinks not   unless they are going to roll out the red carpet and give me first class service  i refuse to pay more to someone that is struggling to speak english    the turn over ratio is higher than a telemarketing call center   so the point of the story is that what you get when you first sign up will change drastically at the time of renewal     been there down that many times with a few ups stores in a few locations 
had a business dinner there  ordered the stone crab for apps  a filet mignon with mashed potatos and spinach  great meal  good service a little pricey  but will return
after receiving their solicitation in the mail and doing research  i decided to call and sign up  the lady i spoke with on the phone was very nice and informative  ive since been listed on their directory and i can say im very happy with their product 
i made a point to stop here for one reason and one reason only   french macarons   i got the assorted pack of macarons  vanilla  pistaccio  raspberry  chocolate  coffee  passionfruit   they are quite pricey compared to my favorite macaron bakery in chicago  and since this is  payard  i was expecting taste bud bliss at first bite    the flavors were amazing  the raspberry and passion fruit being my favorite  every flavor true to its namesake  but the light crunch of biting into a macaron just wasnt there   it was like biting into a soft cookie  and i really dont like soft cookies  give me a bit of crunch anyday   now these just may be how payard makes their macarons  but color me a little disappointed   plus packaging in a cellophane bag   every place ive purchased macarons uses little boxes  you dont want to crush those little gems up     service is friendly but super slow 
i visited gyro express on my 30 minute lunch  i let the young woman at the register know id like my food in a  to go  box before hand even though i didnt get to sit down and eat  she was very kind  i wish i could remember her name  anyway the place was nice and my food was served fairly quickly  i had time to eat there  the portions are big and the chicken was delicious  i also got hummus and a salad with my order  ill definitely be going back 
a new pizza joint   national pizza day   there you go   kismet   first things first   its called 1000 degrees  but the oven was set to 775  if i read it right   and i think the actual temp was even a little lower than that   you may think im being nitpicky  but the crust wanted to be baked in a hotter oven  gummy and a bit tough    i ordered the johnny meatball   first thing  the dough balls get dumped on a layer of semolina about 2  thick and stretched   then the crust is put on a peel and covered in a pie crust shield for saucing   the sauce  btw  was really pretty darned tasty   good mozzarella  maybe a bit much   the meatballs   not my favorite     the interior is really nice  and theyve got the coca cola freestyle machine  lime coke     id probably be up for giving them another try with a different topping  but the crust really needs to get reworked   and 86 the semolina 
i will admit i am completely biased towards this place  i grew up eating their pizza  crust is soft and fluffy  not chewy  the cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place  the sauce has spice but not too much  at some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue  their one downside is that theyre not always consistent  some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done 
this place is located inside of the cosmopolitan  i got the fairfax sandwich  which was a sandwich stuffed with scrambled eggs  at first the first couple of bites were delicious  but after i kept eating it i started to get really sick of it  it was too greasy and cheesy  also i felt like there was too much bread for the amount of eggs inside my sandwich  i also got the slut  which came in a cute glass container with potato puree and eggs on tops  there were also slices of bread for you to dip the eggs and potatoes  this was okay  but i dont know if its worth it  also  it kind of sucked that the seating was limited  there were no seats  so we had to find a table in cosmo hotel  however the workers here were very polite and diligent  which i appreciated   all in all  this place was somewhere i always wanted to try for a long time  but it did not live up to my expectations 
dim sum in arizona wasnt as bad as i thought it would be  its not the best  but i mean it does the trick  there was nothing special or all that memorable about any of the dishes that we tried  i always like the pork buns which was good here too  it was fluffy and the pork was sweet  the tofu with simple syrup was good  but i felt like it was too gingery for my taste  my sister said she loved it because of the ginger taste  but i wasnt a fan  they also had seaweed salad which was a first for me  ive never seen seaweed salad at a dim sum place  so i was happy  however  they gave us a lot and we couldnt finish it  all in all a good dim sum spot if you are craving it 
i purchased a groupon for a partial foil and haircut  i had never heard of this salon but a friend said they bought a similar package from groupon and was pleased    when i arrived at the salon the front door was wide open and it was very humid and hot inside  no air conditioning so i was uncomfortable    i told her i wanted blonde highlights and that i would like if she could just touch up the old highlights  she instead high lighted over the entire already bleached hair causing mild break aways  so i have a long hair that is fine to start with  and now i have hairs that are not even half the length of my over all cut    she is very fast  the color and cut and dry only took 60 minutes    she did  however  answer every call as they came in and would walk away and talk on the phone which i thought was rude  she also had a timer set for me while i sat under the hot lights  when the timer went off she didnt come check on me for some time    when i mentioned that i didnt want to look washed out with only blonde i recommended getting some low lights and she told me that would cost an additional 3 dollars per low light foil  ive never been charged extra before for this option so i thought it was weird    when she was blow drying my hair she was very insensitive to my pain level  she was pulling my hair and the blow dryer temperature was very hot  hot to the point i was making a painful expression    overall  i like the color and cut  but i did not like that she broke off some hairs  i also did not like the service  it turned out ok but i would not go back to this location and i would only recommend it for hair cuts  not color service 
dicks is as good as it gets for breakfast  brunch  lunch  happy hour  dinner  or reverse happy hour   basically  for everything   the bloody marys are made in house  and the homemade red chile is definitely a part of it  as they are spicy  not really into bloodys  but still want to try one  get it in a short glass  that way the vodka mix ratio is better and you can still enjoy a yummy drink  wine  mimosas and bloodys are  5 until 5 30 every single day  and man can they add up  it is just so intimate and cozy  you never want to leave the place   my favorite dish for brunch is the richardons combo  which consists of a pork benedict  asparagus and two chicken enchiladas  i like to swap my enchiladas out for turkey or shrimp  but theyre all yummy  for dinner i either go with the pinenut crusted seabass  seasonal  or the dicks surf   turf  the surf   turf is a 6oz filet topped with 2 bacon wrapped shrimp alongside chorizo and bean flat enchiladas  so good  if i wasnt on a juice cleanse right now  i would have already called in my order to go    the only dessert option is flan  and   well   its flan  i dont know  you be the judge   fyi  it is called dicks hideaway because it is hidden  it is located on the northwest corner of 16th street and bethany home road  inbetween the hardware store and lucys  it does not have a sign  please  please  do not read this review and then call the restaurant to ask where they are located  these are ample directions 
early friday night dinner  no waiting  attentive staff  food was very good  hendrix as background music  especially at 6 30  was incongruous  to their credit  the manager lightened it up a bit   iud go back 
rude bartenders  staff  servers  take your drinks before you finish  i can honestly say the servers seem bitter  if you dont want to be here then stay home  so dissapointed  came here for years but never again 
if you appreciate middle eastern food an  or persian food  you will  love  pars     the owner is always in the back cooking up an amazing and consistently great tasting meal   by far  they have the best hummus in town   pars puts pita jungles hummus to shame   all of their meat skewers are great but the mahi mahi is out of this world   he also cooks amazing zeresch polo  rice with barberries  and everything is so flavorable     although its hidden in ne scottsdale  its well worth the drive and wait 
postinos central originated from postino wine cafe in arcadia  this quaint spot is home to many locals of all types and ages    the environment has a soft ambiance with a more upbeat feel  diners can choose their own wine from the wine racks or order by the glass  you havent experienced postinos until you indulge in their selection of pick and choose bruschettas brought out on a wooden slab  my favorites are the brie   apples with fig spread  the fresh mozzarella with tomato   basil  prosciutto with figs   mascarpone and the warm artichoke spread bruschetta  the panini and soups are also wonderful and they have just started serving brunch on the weekends until 1pm    dont miss out on their monday and tuesday nights special  for  20 00 it includes one bottle of house wine and a slab of bruschetta    i would highly recommend this place for a date night  night out with the girls or gathering  definitely one of my favorite spots in town to sip on wine and take in the scenery while enjoying a mimosa on the patio 
finally a bar in phoenix that understand mixology  great drinks   bar staff is friendly and atmosphere is great 
open late  great service  yummy sushi  ayce 
breakfast buffet at paris was pretty good   but for me buffet once per trip is enough   lines and waits  too much for me  not worth it   i did like their pastries  tons of choices   how much can you really eat though   bacon  eggs and all the regular stuff   not bad compared to other places 
i just moved here and was in desperate need of a color and cut  found this place on yelp  read the reviews and they did not disappoint  i was very nervous but lindsey put me at ease  i found the most amazing person  lindsey  she listened and understood how i wanted my hair  she covered my gray  the color turned out perfect   and the cut was exactly what i wanted  i am so happy with the result  everybody in the salon was very friendly  the only thing is if you want to leave a tip you have to bring cash they dont let you add it to your card  best place ever  will tell everybody about this place  
i was in town for a family emergency and i was trying to find a healthy place to eat nearby  this place had some good reviews so we thought we would try it  unfortunately it ended up being a giant waste of money  it really was way too pricey for what it was  we ended up spending  70 for what was essentially deli food on an ikea plate  the water had floaters in it  the coffee tasted like it came out of a keurig  it was just not worth it at all  2 stars for the decor and overpriced tiramisu 
this place was great from the start  rey is my salesman and if you come here ask for rey  he definitely looked after me through the whole deal he kept checking in on me making sure  i was ok with the car and the deal  once rey and i reached a deal  rey handed me off to ed  i got the same great treatment from ed  he explained very clearly he made sure i knew what i was signing up for and he also made sure i was ok with the deal  as i was signing the papers ed mentioned i could get a lower payment than rey and i agreed to  sure enough ed call back three days later and my payment went down  a lot not just a few dollars  this place really looks out for their customers  i will recommend this place to everyone 
our boy logan had his first boarding experience here and things went well  he seemed happy and healthy when we picked him up and we were so impressed with the staff and how clean and bright the facility is  they were very accommodating to his medication and special feeding instructions and our anxious new parent calls  thank you guys for taking such good care of our baby 
i love it  the hawaiian theme really works here  the drinks are super strong and the bartenders are great 
had some great rolls here but the pink lady was our favorite  look forward to coming back  fyi the tempura ice cream is amazing
sushi was great  loved the cucumber salad  all around a really good sushi place  def going back sometime 
great service and friendly atmosphere  for the girl on the go  they always meet my needs and provide the resources i need to run my business efficiently  timely  helpful  and they treat you just like family  very convenient and competitive prices too  plus its a great neighborhood location  thank you 
they really did an amazing job  my wife is so impressed  our main walk through was so dirty and they made it look and feel like a brand new carpet  we nice crew and friendly as well  will for sure use again in the future 
very nice looking restaurant  staff very nice  starters excellent  then we came to the mains  where do i start   my wife had the hake  looked nice  but the whole dish was immersed in a soup type gravy   sauce  as soon as meal was delivered  the mashed potato that the hake was sitting on began to dissolve making it  not a very pleasant experience  i had the fish   chips   not the right choice  the batter was just a soggy mass  no crunch at all  i would say that it had been left standing for quite a while  or the fat it was fried in was not hot enough  if the chef cant get this very simple dish right  then it should be taken off the menu    please do something about the  size of those chips  far too big  chips should have a crisp outer  these did not  please try a bit harder  i like the venue   would like to return 
the worst hotel we have ever stayed at  we live in barstow so we go to las vegas often  we also get hotels in n hollywood la etc all the time and this was the worst hotel experience yet  there was bed bugs or some kind of tiny black bugs all over the room  it was overall just dirty and unkept  it lacked pride for sure  maybe the employees arent happy  there was at least 3 long brown hairs found just on the bathroom sink alone  you could easily find multiple really dirty spots that have clearly been missed for days or weeks  the clock  radio didnt work  at least one lamp didnt work  there was only one chair  there was a fridge but no microwave  the tv was garbage  worst tv i have seen in a loooong time  there wasnt even any fruits or vegetables at all provided with the breakfast that comes with room  who doesnt have fruit in their continental breakfast   lol  when we went to the pool the towels are smedium white ones lol and we took the last two that were out and a group of three came to the pool within minutes to find no towels available 
i made an appointment to get my hair cut here with brandy after trying a couple places in pittsburgh  brandy listened to what i wanted and gave me an amazing professional yet stylish hair cut that is perfect for my lifestyle  i plan on coming here for all of my hair needs  the salon itself was very clean and it was a very nice environment to be in 
get your phone fix here   fones gone wild     kimbo fix my iphone 7    quick service and friendly   thank you ill come back next time when i get my screen cracked   get itt here
mexican food especially tex mex is my absolute favorite  i have traveled all over the country and even mexico to find some of the best tasting mexican food  pacos tacos is by far one of the best places in the country  i truly recommend you make the effort to try this delicious food
first time here  service was good and fast  food was excellent   tacos were big and my bulgogi was perfect  no kids menu  but when we ordered they offered kid size for us   great place and we will be back
good food  kind service  quick service  juice smoothies are refreshing addition to typical middle eastern menu  casual dress 
pretty standard five guys in peoria  im a giant fan of their veggie sandwich while my friends love the burgers so its a definite win win when we go in  im also a super french fry fanatic and grab the cajun fries here any chance i get  service is typically good and the food is pushed out quickly which i really appreciate  stop in if youre in the mood for a burger and some great fries 
i always wanted to try this restaurant but was even more intrigued when i saw the mixed reviews  overall  i dont understand how this place doesnt have at least 4 stars  sure  the service wasnt the best ive had but there wasnt a single beverage or dish we ordered that wasnt absolutely perfect  every detail down to the napkins have been thought out to the t  i encourage everyone wanting to try this place to ignore the nit picky reviews 
i love this place  clean relaxing nice staff  they do an excellent job on pedicures   pay attention to detail
came here a second time and i still love this place  i ordered the bannock bannock again which is still delicious but i feel like this time they made it fatter  also  the first time they didnt fold it so i had to guess how to eat the thing and i guess right because the second time i went  they folded it in half   also had the mac and cheese which i really enjoyed  would i order it again  probably not but its something worth trying   i tried their parsnip soup which was good  the main reason why i ordered it was because of the pumpkin seeds in the soup  i was disappointed with the pumpkin seed because i thought they were going to make the seed crispy but it was too soft for my liking  the soup itself was delicious   the sweet potato fries here are good but they added too much salt  i enjoy my sweet potato fries with a bit of salt and pepper because i think it enhances the sweet taste but they went a bit overboard with the salt   the roast duck poutine pizza was a disaster in my opinion  i never really enjoy poutine pizza but with that aside  the duck was way to dry  the fries reminded me of kfc fries  nothing wrong with that for those who like kfc fries but i dont like kfc fries   i guess im not the kind of girl that enjoys just putting anything on her pizza   for dessert  i tried the smores and its not that great  the graham cracker was a bit soggy and there wasnt enough of it  it reminded me of a lava cake  go for the tart if youre craving dessert   another highlight of the meal was the mighty canuck  i absolutely love that drink  the glass is sugar rimmed and theres a sugared orange chocolate candy on top of the drink  i also tried the back forty  i think thats what its called  and theres too much cucumber taste in that   service was still great  they refilled our water whenever it was half full and took away empty plates  also  they didnt charge me for the back forty and kindly replaced it with the mighty canuck 
i came here with my boyfriend for a snack  from the outside  the restaurant looks really sketchy  however  the interior was very cute because everything was mismatched in a good way   the service was a bit slow but i didnt mind it considering the prices on the menu  they have a huge selection of food here for a very cheap price  we got fried calamari and wings  the wings were average but the fried calamari really hit the spot   i would definitely come back here for some cheap eats 
oh  yeah  its chinese food alright   pretty authentic   hey the chefs and wait staff are all chinese    cantonese    just had the beef chow fen  and it taste exactly like the  10 one i get in ca    but it cost me  23    oh well  its in bellagio  with people gambling with  25 chips  so i guess that kind of price cannot be avoided 
great hotel and casino   considering i always stay here for free  comps    would have been  600 per night   the rooms are modern and very nice  with lcd tv and upscale materials   got to watch out for the snack bar   they charged me for something i didnt take   took a while to clear that up   location is not as central   next nice casino is about 10 15 minutes walking distance away   i like the pool the most   its 3 pools in line connected by a narrow stream  so you can swim straight for a long time   they have free  iced bottled waters  the buffet here is excellect   better than bellagios  similar food variety  much better quality   as for the casino  i like the slots   as some have mentioned  the table minimums are very high   you can find the cheaper  40 tables  but those maybe the ones with the machine card sorters  which i dont like    someone on the craps table was playing with about  1  2 million worth of chips   rows of white  5000 chips    just saw kobe bryant there 
just went to brick for the first time   the food  we delicious and our server manny was amazing  polite attentive    definitely will be back   
this place is really delicious  usually pretty busy but worth the wait  i havent tried anything i didnt like   my favorite is the fried pickles okra  and they make a darn good burger and fries  intimate and special environment   perfect for a birthday dinner with friends   try to man a table in the back by the fireplace 
first time coming here  it was amazing  i usually hit up ra sushi down the road from this place but i think this might be my new sushi spot  the workers were very nice  the food was very delicious  the roll royce roll waa to die for  you definitely need to try this place 
loved this place   i think i prefer nurses doing injections as opposed to doctors they seem to know the tricks   lol  wonderful job with the dysport groupon i purchased and i will be back in the fall 
dr vrenon has been my dentist since 2005   i have a huge phobia with dentists   before dr vrenon  i needed xanax just to go to a cleaning or exam appointment   he is very gentle and such an amazing dentist   i needed some major work  and he has always treated me very respectfully   he is the only one that i trust to work on my teeth 
i have only eaten here three times  but all three times have been fantastic   the pizza is amazing  some of the best pizza i have ever eaten    the service is great  and they have a great beer  wine selection 
the food here is very good  but it is a little overpriced   i would probably rate the food about 4 out of 5 stars     the service here is the worst   we have eaten here three times   every time we have had different wait staff  and every time we regret eating there   the staff is snobby  rude  slow  and condescending   if the prices were reasonable we would put up with the torture of the service people  but for what they charge it is not worth it 
first  let me start by saying this bad review has nothing to do with our meals  which were delicious   my brother took our families to mortons last night and we were seated in a private room   my husband and i arrived first and we told our waitress to please put all of the drinks on a separate bill which we would pay   she said this would not be a problem   everyone else arrived and we proceeded to order drinks and food   everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks   as we were finishing  i suddenly noticed our waitress had given the bills to my brother    we were seated at opposite ends of the table      i got her attention and asked for the bill for the drinks   she said my brother had already paid both bills   i told her that we had said we wanted the bill for the drinks   she shrugged her shoulders and said   sorry  i got confused    then she left   my brother wouldnt let us reimburse him and i didnt want to make a fuss at the restaurant   however  this is not the type of service i expect to receive at a top restaurant   no attempt was made to correct the error   i was angry at the mistake and angrier at her cavalier attitude   good food doesnt make up for bad service and i dont think ill be back any time soon 
front desk staff gets an a  for cheerfulness and efficiency  but someone needs to school the housekeeping crew  first room i checked into had a used soap in the shower and the grout was moldy  second room had crumbs under the entertainment console  but after traveling all day i was too tired to complain about it  windows open  which is nice if you dont mind highway noise  wifi is fast and free  i found the rooms to be average sized  this double queen has fridge  micro which is handy 
this was my first visit   as far as cell phone stores  this appears to be the gold standard   its obvious they train their people to the max   as soon as i walked in a young lady extended her hand and cheerfully gave her name and asked mine   compared to two other cell companys stores  one of them just lets you wander in and wait to see if someone finally recognizes you and the other makes you feel like you are an insignificant number   the sales people are unusually professional  kinda like robots  but nice robots   all are friendly and sincere and extremely knowledgeable    the place reeks of well done training   i was there to look at a new combo smartphone  notepad called the samsung galaxy note   the poster in the front window promised me they carried it   the young lady greeter let me roam and in less than a minute 2 young guys approached me and identified themselves as being samsung specialists   that was interesting  i dont think i ever saw salespeople who were specifically trained in one product   they both had the product i came to see in their hands and proceeded to corner me  in a nice way  to show me how it worked  including taking a picture that they photoshopped into a cool picture of me skydiving   this is one cool phone  er tablet  er  whatever it is  but whatever it is i cant seem to be able to live without it   not good for the store that there were only a few other customers  i wonder if anybody knows they are there  but good for me that i didnt have to wait forever to talk to somebody   the two young guys ended up taking me to the sales counter so i could get an idea how much mac  cheese i would have to eat to afford my new toy   this is a cell phone store that does what they do at a professional level  isnt it sad that i have to say that  because so many retailers dont even have a clue what customer service even means 
to get this out of the way up front  the storefront picture here appears not to be the tempe location  maybe its the mesa place   the tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the mill ave nightlife   there is barely a sign on the building  the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme  the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter   it looks like a bar with a few 2 person tables and thats all     until you accidentally discover that the bar  with barstools  is actually a  kitchen  with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar  passing the restrooms  you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar   we ate in the kitchen  bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room   the employees seemed to all guys  with a distinct aura of all being bikers  but they were super friendly and acceptably attentive   assuming the food is made from scratch  the 20   30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable   you can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers   at  6 50  my oggie pasty was a good value   the crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty   i learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that i am not a fan of rutabaga  but thats not their fault  the amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket   the brown wine gravy was yummy   the place sends a confusing message  it absolutely looks like a college dive  and i probably would be there all the time if i attended asu  but its quite a hike from campus  its not scottsdale funky  yea     and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place   its a curiously quiet place  none of the ribaldry you would find at an irish pub  the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70s and 80s    bottom line   its rare to find a good pasty in this area  and these are good   as the rating states  its a ok 
i have been at bar louies a few times   happy hour is hard to find a table   happy hour boneless chicken is the best  bbq    hot and i have lunch the next day   tues  they have a special  5 00 burgers with fries or tots  gotta luv it  all wait staff is so friendly great happy hour or just a friendly drinking spot  must go see for yourself 
came in for my mmj card and saw dr weingrow he was so awesome be not judge he is friendly   i came in and they say hi and make sure you know every step of the way me keep you in the loop  it was awesome to get in and out in 46 minutes 
being an ex manager myself this is a great place to live  my wife and i have lived here for two years and are very pleased with not only the place but with management  mr  santos and miss jessica  whom are very professional and stays on top of things  your made to feel like family here  the atmosphere is great  respectfully yours  happy campers
the black mole chicken tacos are the best ive had in phoenix   ive eaten black mole from mexico city to the yucatan  and these will rival any of them  except for our aunts in mexico city 
when we stayed here last year we got the room with the fountain view  wow      stunning     watching it from your room is amazing and romantic  especialy when the tv is snyced with the fountains and its playing andre bochelli       watching it from outside is alot of fun to  a must see   music is amazing though
ill make this short but a friend from work has been talking about how i need to check this place out because its the best burger joint ever    and she was right     burger bar is hands down the best burger ive ever had   i ordered the atlantic salmon steak burger with onions  jalepeno bacon  light mayo  zucchini    it was the best    i am gonna try the kobe beef burger next time   
the luxor is just getting alittle to old for me  dont get me wrong i love the online deals they send me  very cheap rates  lax was okay  i would go back to the luxor  o ya i did enjoy the chris angel show 
hands down best nightclub ive been to so far in vegas    i was very impressed   its huge and the decor is very nice   they hooked us up with a table cause we had a solid group with us   a gorgeous club for sure with gorgeous people  badass to how they had tables to gamble if you want to put down a bet  amazing place i will be returning again
we ate here based on a comment from a friend   not my cup of tea     1   to the manager   your windows face west   get some sun shades  it was brutally hot  uncomfortable  and too much glare and we were just sitting  i cant imagine how hot and sweaty the service staff has to be and they have to look in to that sun to wait on people   they could use sunglasses    2   if you dont like paprika and spicy breading   dont eat here   it was on the chicken  the fried pickles  the fries   i thought everything tasted a bit  scorched  as far as the breading  but the inside of the chicken was moist and not over cooked  which is normally how chicken comes out to you    the salad was good   a cooling food on your tongue as you eat the breading   wont be back   too bad they dont offer a non spicy alternate 
i had high hopes  alas  not the case  service was extremely slow  took at least 15 minutes to get our beer and then my beer was flat  took it back to the bar to tell them and the bartender tried to tell us that it was a nitro beer and supposed to be that way  ive had this beer before  many times in fact  its the beer of choice for me and i know what it should taste like  our server was nice enough to take it back and take it off the check  food was ok  missing some components on the sandwich that were on the menu but not on the actual sandwich  fries were good  i like the atmosphere and decor  but that wont go far if the food and bartender are not up to par 
my favorite sushi place in las vegas       i go here any chance i get  i live on the opposite side of town   but it is definitely worth the trip      theyre always busy  so prep for a lil wait       but if you like sushi its worth the wait      
i had the beef tikka and the chicken samosa    it was fantastic       so much flavor  great portions for the price  the staff was lovely  very excited for their first day if buisness  i will definitely be back for more   
i love this shop and often treat myself to something nice  they stock a lovely range of hemp clothing  socks and nomad clothing  i love it because its different to the usual highstreet stuff  they are also environmentally aware  stocking jewelery made from recycled materials and the bags they use are made from newspaper  i appreciate that  its not something you see enough of  go and support a small local business  p s  the staff are always very friendly and chatty
loved the food  had to wait for about an hour but given it was a friday night it was understandable  the environment is great  busy and bustling just like a thai food joint should be  recommend the khao soi but all the dishes are great  the green curry in a fresh coconut not only looked good but had great taste  will come to this place again for all my thai food cravings  highly recommended 
great steaks   good desserts even better service 
beautiful designed hotel inside and out  a lot of attention to detail  stayed in the terrace one bedroom  fantastic view facing the strip  derrick at the front desk was very friendly and helpful while checking us into our room  our hotel had a japanese soaking tub  what a relaxing amenity  we will only stay at the cosmo when we go to vegas  fantastic customer service and a modern hotel 
bottom line  dont waste your time  horrible  poor service      lets just say we showed up at 6 20 pm and told they were running behind and we would have to wait a bit for food  which ok  we drove all this way we can wait no biggy  we set up our  own table   sat and waited  twenty minutes passed  we watched the waitress serve two other tables  refill drinks and polish silver ware   the whole time we sat parched with no service and treated as unwanted guests   after seeing the waitress giggle with her co worker numerous times as we sat unattended  we finally had enough of the poor service and walked out the door  i am sure they didnt care and were rather happy that we left because it was one less paying customer to deal with   that will be the first and last time we ever try jakes especially with my out of town family members  thanks for the great story that we can tell over and over again 
i am a big fan of japanese food   with all the reviews   i got to try this place   i have to say  i am not overwhelm   hands down a place is fun and welcoming   if you are with a big group of friends for some beers   this is perfect   the grill black cod   10 stars    melt in your mouth   one of the best i had rest of the items is only average  ribs   soso tuna tartar   below soso takoyaki   very far off marks   the one i had in osaka is 10 points   they are around 4   i expected to be high 7 or 8     noise level is very high   in case you are bring young ones 
first off i have to say this is a buffet and my rating compares buffet to buffet land or cruise  i seen the low reviews  it tried it anyway  there was a lot of choices  food was hot and filled  waitress was attentive and friendly  all in all it was a good buffet meal  they had roast beef  crab legs  lunch and breakfast options   use the my vegas app to save 
an iceberg lettuce pile with very little else and cold gyro meat on top makes for a huge disappointment  one tomato slice  three kalamata olives  a tiny amount of feta that would hardly fill up a mouses belly   it was barely edible and far from enjoyable   just because youre running a dive doesnt mean you have to serve crappy food   m tg s should think a little harder amount the concept of  salad    additionally  the pork souvlaki was super full of gristle   the floors and covered with food and the place  bathrooms included  is generally filthy 
this little mom and pop sushi bar is just the kind of place that needs local support  i love this place  it is just the way i envision traditional japanese sushi bars to be  no glitz  no hip coolness   just a comfortable family run neighborhood place to get a great meal in a friendly atmosphere  the food is fresh and very tasty  they have a sushi roll for each state in the country   their fried rice is super tasty  very comfort foodish  service could be a little better but all in all i think this is a great little place 
great food  great drinks  great service  with a great view   i should have written this when i still remembered the bartenders and our servers names  and what dishes were my favorites  instead  i simply have to say that i had wanted to try lago for quite some time  and i was very happy that i finally did   the caveat  as always  with lago and other great restaurants on the strip is that you pay a premium for occupying valuable real estate  even if its only for an hour or two  the delicious  16 cocktails add up even faster than some of the tasty tapas 
opening caveat  i am just realizing that i need to take the yelp categories more literally  three stars is a ok  and thats what im giving little tonys  my previous reviews of other restaurants suffered from grade inflation      in terms of little tonys  we had a perfectly good meal late last night  service was attentive  from both the server and the manager  and prices were good  we happened to arrive late enough to benefit from the nightly happy hour from 10 p m  until closing  in terms of food  the meatballs were fantastic  tasty and hot  temperature wise   with plenty of red sauce  the calamari was edible  but much too large and rubbery for my tastes  the 9  new york style new yorker pie was acceptable  too much crust and not enough gooey  mozzarella y  tomato y middle for me  that may be in part because when i lived in new york city  no pizza place served 9  pies  there was always tons of middle relative to crust  still  little tonys 9  new yorker was dry  it tasted good  but it wasnt an east coast  tri state area pie   i think thats just the problem with having lived in new york city  when you leave  you judge pizzas  and bagels   by degrees of disappointment  eating at little tonys  you will leave well fed  but you will not leave thinking youve had an out of body experience that landed you in new york 
soggy cold pizza   tastes like cardboard    total crap   was staying with friends and they only live 3  4 mile and we got the food 3 hours later    bitter sauce  strange aftertaste    tasted like raw dough    total waste 
my daughter  daughter in law  and i came to jeffre scott by way of reading reviews for getting makeup done on yelp   we were having a family portrait taken and wanted to be sure wed be happy with the outcome   did we ever make the right call   charlton  travis  and joanna welcomed us and made us feel so special   the makeup was fantastic   they were teaching us as they applied the products they have really nice lines  ie  kevin aucoin  and exclusively carry a line out of amsterdam that is great   it can be a little pricey  but so are the lines at the department stores  without the personal  more private attention   its well worth it  and i never felt pressured to buy   jeffre scott is the place to feel pampered and pretty   do yourself a big favor  and let charlton  travis  and joanna work their magic 
great place if you are looking for huge pieces of sashimi for a great price  their rolls are not the best ever but they are good  there rolls are big and the pieces are big too  if you have a big mouth this is the place  if not then you might need to cut each piece in two  great place for the price 
very refreshing place to eat  i am glad i came in  the wine was great and the the food was excellent  they have rabbit on the menu and the lady down the bar ordered it  when it came out it looked good  she said she liked it  clean new restaurant in the heart of downtown mesa  gotta come back 
this place was awful   pulled the bait and switch tactic  we called to verify they still had vehicle from website  they confirmed  we got there and they were like buzzards standing on wire waiting for ppl as you pulled in  immediately approached us and we told them what vehicle we were here for and then brought us inside for info  took our keys and vehicle around back for inspection  after 30 min we still hadnt been shown that vehicle or any car  finally they said we are cleaning up a car to show us    at that point we said we would come back another time   of course the little sales girl ran off to get sales mgr who tried to befriend me thru my daughter  i  firmly asked for my keys and vehicle  they put up no fight  when walking to our car the sales girl apologized and said another person was there buying the car we had drove all the way there for  i will never return to this dealer and would give negative stars if i could 
been to a lot of these reflexology places and this one is fantastic   i listened to reviews and went with the 90 min massage which was great    got my own private  section  room and the masseuse was fantastic  he would ask about the pressure and even told me during the foot part of the massage that i needed to cut down on my sugar intake  ive never had someone actually tell me their findings of the painful parts of my foot  it wasnt painful per se   but the part that hurts talks about the inner working of your organs  so it was really cool he suggested to cut back on sugar    im totalling coming back here when in vegas   
terrible service  went here with my family an i ordered a gyro  the pita bread was more like calzone bread  barely any sauce  2 tomatoes  and disgusting red onion  i asked the waiter to take it off the bill  which he did  but he gave me major attitude  if i had not been with my grandparents i would have probably got in a verbal altertcation with him  but i guess i have to feel bad for the kid  being a waiter in fountain hills  anyways stay clear of this place 
this is by far the best asian food weve had for such a long time   thank you to the owners for making such delicious food and providing great service 
my friends and i are here in vegas working from out of town and were looking for a sushi dinner  we went on yelp and found this place  the reviews seemed great so we tried it out  we sat down and ordered and the first thing i asked for was a side of yuzu sauce because i do not like  use soy sauce because of health reasons  they told me no that i couldnt have it because its too expensive   too expensive i asked  ok  so can you charge me for a side of it  they said no  but brought me a very small side of it  enough to dip three pieces of sushi in   not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray   when i asked for more  they all of a sudden ran out   we then ordered the yuzu yellowtail off the menu and lone behold more yuzu sauce appeared   all of our sushi rolls came out  with the thinnest pieces of cut sushi i have personally ever had   they were basically just rice rolls   this is not what i call sushi  this restaurant should be called rice rolls 21 not sushi 21  we should have just gone with our first yelp review which was sushi house goyemon  they had awesome sushi and great service  bummed we did not have a good experience 
were snowbirds whove been coming here for 7 years in spite of the old owner because of the great music  real dance scene with young lindy dancers and some great senior dancers   now under new owner and chef and the food is fabulous   more pricey than in the old days but you get what you pay for and every meal weve had has been worth every penny 
if you are looking for a cheap  clean room  this is definitely the right place  the casino per say is not great  but it is the only place i found a 1  roulette and a 5  blackjack that does not have a perpetual shoe  stay away from those    dealers were okay  desk staff was nice  the room was great for a 35  room with two queen beds  its not on the strip  but the parking is free and there is a free shuttle every now and then that drops you on the strip and that you can take later to come back to the hotel  not bad at all 
two piece and a biscuit       my partner and i decided to dine at pino this evening as we live nearby and heard some really nice things about the restaurant  my partner called ahead at around five pm and made a reservation for eight oclock  arriving on time we were left standing at the hostess stand for nearly fifteen minutes before someone came to seat us  while waiting the female bartender asked if there was anything we would like from the bar  we decided on two light beers     the server was nice  however we waited for at least ten minutes for the bread plate to come out  and awhile longer for the calamari  salad and finally the main course  my partners plate had to be sent back due to it being practically raw  when he requested well done      after nearly two hours   1 40min  we were more than finished and eager to go home  on the way out the bar tender called out in a husky voice  sir  you forgot to pay your beer tab   the service was slow and not very hospitable  the plate  the steak was delicious  unfortunately my partners was less than mediocre      unfortunately we will not return to pino any time soon due to our experience  if you decide to try pino then i suggest arriving ten minutes late and eat an appetizer before you get there    
jupiter artland is a strange and wonderful place  its one of those places that you cant help wondering how they manage to survive  for one thing its next to impossible to get to without a car  and on initial inspection it doesnt seem to have much going on to sustain interest  but dont be deceived   vanity project it may be  but this is a veritable wonderland of mystery waiting to be discovered as you walk around the grounds   arriving through the wonderfully ornate gates gives you a hint that something special lies ahead  the narrow road winds through the woodland estate  with the occasional passing place  the same road leads in and out   something they could do with remedying at the earliest opportunity   until suddenly you emerge between two huge grassy mounds  part of charles jencks magnificent land forms installation  for me the main highlight of the place   after this the road deteriorates into an unsurfaced track until you reach the car park   again something that needs addressing urgently  the car park itself is located quite a way from the entrance and shop  although there is disabled parking a little closer  the warm orange painted bonnington house is glimpsed through hedges and trees as you approach the main courtyard   theres a cafe here serving coffee and lunches  and a shop with a select assortment of artistic goodies for the more discerning giftaholics  and from there you are free to take off in whatever direction you like along the woodland paths  where some amazing pieces of contemporary art await discovery  get a free map from the shop where you pay your entrance fee  and set off into the unknown  its an adventure akin to entering wonderland  and you can wander to your hearts content  discovering all the secret places and pondering the significance of the placement of the artworks  which have all been sited in accordance with some geomantic plan    after the jencks landforms  i think my favourite was the amethyst grotto  a highly energetic space that i couldnt stay in for more than a couple of minutes  but there are many artworks to choose from  and a walk around the estate could easily become a great adventure for children   or adults who can recall that sense of childlike wonder 
this zizzi was the first place where i found pasta in squid ink sauce  and ive been a fan of that ever since  sadly  it wasnt on the menu on this visit  but i did have a nice linguine with king prawns    it was early evening on a thursday and the place was packed  i guess it was the pre theatre crowd or something  but they didnt have any tables free  however  i only had to wait ten minutes or so before one became available    the waiter was very helpful with food intolerance issues and recommended the pasta that i chose  however it was the only pasta dish that i could eat so id already bookmarked it  in retrospect  i wish id picked the sea bass in paper instead  as then i could have had the special starter  which was king prawn skewers in garlic sauce  but as that would have been a total crustacean fest  instead i opted for a portion of garlic bread   i quite like zizzis   there are better places around but theyre fairly dependable on the italian food front 
its been a long time since ive been to banns  but as i had a couple of hours to spare and happened to be at this end of town  i decided to treat myself  it was early  so the place was pretty empty so i was soon ensconced in a seat by the window   having so many yummy veggie   vegan things on the menu  its hard to choose what to eat   its such a luxury knowing that you can eat practically anything on the menu for once  i eventually settled for the thai fritter of broccoli and marinated tofu starter  followed by stir fried veg with udon noodles and smoked tofu for the main  washed down with a large glass of chilean carmenere   a red wine that until recently was mistaken for a merlot  according to the wine list  im not sure that it was the correct choice for my meal as i found it rather too rich for my taste  but it was an excellent wine nonetheless   everything too delicious for words  especially the main course which came topped with the biggest slab of tofu ive ever seen on a dish  however  i think i will still reserve my accolade of  best tofu in the known universe  for the hanoi bike shop in glasgow    so hats off to banns   still as good as i remembered  ill try not to leave it as long before my return 
wow  pleasance really rocks during the festival  ive been here a couple of times out of season  but that doesnt prepare you for the madness that takes over the place for the fringe  there are awnings  tents  stalls and even a couple of small venues jostling for position in the courtyard like a medieval carnival or something    take a deep breath before plunging in  otherwise youll be completely overwhelmed by the noise and spectacle    i found it a little hard to find what venue my show was actually being performed in as the ticket simply said pleasance courtyard  but as the performance time grew closer some helpful ushers appeared with big signs and started organising queues for the various shows  so it all worked out well   i loved the bar area towards the rear with its comfy armchairs  a nice place to relax between shows and fairly close to the loos as well  which was nice    one of the better organised fringe venues  this ranks alongside assembly and gilded balloon at the top of the fringe pile 
the food is delicious especially the signature french toast  however the place is hard to find they are not located at the address posted  they are off of goldwater and main street
i only spent about 15 minutes here  but they did everything right   the host was very friendly on both the greeting and the goodbye   the place looked clean   i ordered a yeungling draft  only 2 75  because i cant get it in michigan and had a shot of jack fire   bartender was nice   did not eat food let alone even look at a menu   so take my limited review with a grain of salt   only reason not 5 stars    5 25 for the jack was a touch high   had a solid looking patio and a decent amount of draft beers 
i cant sing this place enough praises  ive been patronizing this establishment periodically for nearly a decade  and ive never had a negative experience  the owner is an old soul  and he can be rough around the edges  but he knows vietnamese food  and really opens up once he starts to remember you  the food is always impeccable  this is still one of the best kept secrets in the burgh  and id give it six stars if i could 
an  everything  cookie with pina colada ice cream and a mud ice cream  it was so good combined  yum  i highly recommend those flavours 
i must say  i learned a lot at outrageous olive oils and vinegars   to make healthy  original olive oil  not the one on the shelf at the grocery store   is a very complex process using the right olives  at the right time and chemistry   deana  showed us all the right way to taste olive oil and vinegars  as well as pesto  and something alittle sweet   deana was extremely knowledgeable and explained health benefits as well   was totally amazed the complete difference in her product vs  grocery   i highly recommend you make a stop here the next time you are in scottsdale   this was our 2nd stop when on arizona food tour   outrageous olive oils and vinegars was an awesome place 
as a diamond guest  that means i spend way too much time in hotels  it was far below average  the biggest issues were the rooms  as they are like being in a dungeon with the darkness  not good  the biggest issues is the loudness in the rooms  you can hear everything   so if someone on your floor comes in late you will be woken up for sure  yeah thats quite bad  and the bar and restaurant are quite    not good  the bar had a poorer selection of scotch than places in the usa  how is this possible    and the food is average at best   the staff  however  is quite amazing and friendly  so there is that 
jesus the food is good here   super small place  make reservations no matter what   wow the food and service is simply outstanding   this is a foodie place bar none    so dont be a fool and stay in the tourist areas for food  come here  oh    did i mention its inexpensive  yeah    it pays to explore 
dont stop here if you need to make a flight   even if you feel like you have plenty of time   the place is mass confusion   nobody seems to know which table theyre waiting on   management needs to rethink their process   food and drink were decent but not worth the stress 
thank you god for stonebridge manor  we instantly fell in love with stonebridge  the environment was magical and beautiful  and the staff was so inviting  after attending an open house and choosing our vendors  stonebridge did all the legwork scheduling appointments  they made it so effortless and easy to plan our dream wedding during hectic work schedules  our wedding day went off without a hitch  it was spectacular and more than we could have ever imagined  thank you stonebridge manor for giving us the wedding of a lifetime 
i dont know why this place has 3 5 stars  i really loved this club  the atmosphere  the people  the staff  the music  were all amazing  3lau killed it  i i love him  ugh  i would definitely go back  another thing i loved about this place was you can actually dance without worrying about the space  not to worry about drop kicking peoples faces because theyre being rude af  cant wait to come back  i love life  i love 3lau 
i make better nachos drunk in my bathtub  cool music videos  though  decent location 
nice place for jazz   loved maureen budway last night 
if the bartender wasnt having a  bad day  the first time i visited vesper  id have given 5 stars for sure  quality quality quality drinks and ingredients  they arent bartenders  theyre drink masters or some other unique nomenclature  they made art with mint leaves  shakers  muddlers  and whatever else they used behind that counter    not your average vegas lobby bar  this place is super legit  they really take their time making superior beverages  so dont show up in a hurry  youll be dissapointed in the wait  rather than impressed with the result 
jjs is a staple for my office  its close  consistent  and well priced  their happy hour is also a great value  and goes later from 4 8 pm daily  beat that   4 house margaritas pack a punch along with the value  not a ton of flavor   but take a trip to the salsa bar and add your own  i feel like its healthier with less grease and maybe thats the flavor compromise  one of the best choices in the shopping center  by far 
chicago dog   italian beef  w  hot peppers    amazing  i dont understand the negative reviews  this place is a chicago food lovers machine  turning through an insane amount of hungry patrons per hour    order number 94 out the door 
cool park  lots of space to walk around and enjoy the day with family and friends  the only disappointing part is the size of the dog park  its relatively small compared to how large the park is overall and theres only one bench for seating  everyone is friendly and we will likely pack a lunch to eat next to the pond with the ducks 
i have been shopping with a second look since they were near thunderbird and they have changed quite a bit   they have alot of their own new items   i would recommend them as a shopping experience but not to people looking to consign   i am not saying they are being dishonest  i suspect they just receive too much product and they do not give you an option of picking them up they just decide what they will donate   i recently took in 50  nice clothing items that i paid more to have cleaned than i made on them   after their fees and donations i received a credit of  10   i spent more than that on gas to get to the store   in the future if i happen to be in the area i would certainly stop in  but would not go out of my way to shop there 
i dont trust anyone else with my kids   weve had a great experience with all the doctors but especially love dr  aaron   hes caring and witty which helps calm my girls when they have to go in for a visit  i cant get my girls to go see a doctor at urgent care or a hospital but they never mind seeing dr  aaron   the front desk staff are always polite  quick and helpful which means a lot when youre stressed out with a sick kid   east valley has seen most of our family through the teenage years and we will continue to send generations there 
the place is empty    the kids who work there are atrociously rude  this young girl who works there with strait brown hair  short and very skinny  has a baby face  was incredibly unkind to us  my friend was placing his order and she was  hostile towards  he is a really sweet guy  she asked me a question and i said pardon and she shrieked ketchup  mustard or mayo   when we were waiting for our meal they kept laughing and looking at us  was so unbelievably rude  i have no idea why they treated us so inhumanely  i asked her something about the sauce and she looked at me like i was stupid and yelled tzatziki and started talking about me to this blond chick  ive never experienced this level of audacious and cruel service in my life    our buns were cold and our burgers were covered with black filth  they seemed to snicker at us behind our back because they were serving us burnt burgers    their fries look disgusting and are loaded with salt  since the buns were not toasted they become soggy in a matter of a few minutes and i couldnt even finish this soggy mess of a burger and their deformed appearing fries that looked like they were diseased grossed me out    go to big boy burgers   their customer service is excellent and i dont mind the fact that they only take cash anymore because this level of horrendous behavior which really makes you feel humiliated and worthless is completely not worth being exposed to and to top it off the food is total crap  they do not care about providing you with delicious food or even friendly service   they joke around and laugh at you  i left despirited and i know i will never ever return there and will without hesitation inform people who i know  and i know a lot of people in whitby  also about my experience  i am also going to post on urban spoon just in case somebody misses this post  i believe in being kind to people and this behavior when combined with the abominable food just makes me sick to my stomach 
awesome   the sushi was delicious and the chef  s were so energetic and friendly  and funny  will go again   
plus another 1  2 star for the excellent service   we had the capreezy sandwich  chicken   beet salad and du gouda sandwich as well as  party tators   the tators were excellent and the sandwiches were very tasty  side salads are included so filling  too  the salad was ok but nothing too special   the place is adorable  very family friendly and a good place to hang out alone too since it has plenty of seating and different sections   would definitely go again next time we are in town 
if it is stolen or damaged in the possession of  levine it is your loss not theirs    i had several items in the january first 2017 auction   the auction house was robbed the night before and about  70 000 of my stuff was taken   i showed up for the  auction and there was police tape everywhere  i was informed that they were insured and that it would not be a problem   well i was never contacted by the insurance company for levine and my insurance company reported to me that in the auction agreement levine states very clearly that they are not responsible for damage or theft of thing given to them to auction   if you consign with them  make sure your homeowners covers your stuff   levine is not responsible and pay nothing 
went here yesterday for dinner  had the pork chops  red beans  mac n cheese  and corn bread    corn bread was soft and delicious   pork chop was thin and had enough seasoning on it for me    overall i was pretty happy with my selection  the waitress was friendly and id go here again 
wanted to mention that this location is run by great team of managers and customer service is great  manager connie is truly a class act    thank you   
amazing  it was an absolute pleasure conducting business with the owner        my husband and i were on a major budget when we decided to redo my parents house  after spending countless days shopping around  i found quality  service  and pricing of other flooring businesses were not meeting our criteria  and this place was our last resort  we were amazed the accuracy  professionalism  outstanding quality of work  and overall experience with this business  they were able to meet all our expectations and more  the owner was so straightforward and honest which i find amazing nowadays  so grateful    thank you so much    i can not wait to do more business with you guys in the future    
almost every buffet place in vegas is named   insert hotel name here  the buffet  so it was refreshing to come across wicked spoon in cosmopolitan  we got there around 11 am and thank goodness not many people know how delicious this place is because the lines were short  buffet price is ok  29 on sunday holiday weekend and my friend mention it was  22 on monday  my favorite was the prime ribs  bbq ribs  an assortment of ice cream which i helped myself to a triple stacker  choc mint  green tea  and chocolate   i like how they put some of the foods like chicken wings in little baskets so you dont end up grabbing so many that you cant finish it all and end up wasting food    the only complaint i had was the mac and cheese but i wont doc a star off because it wasnt horrible  just a little bland    would definitely come back next trip    
i loved having dinner there  but for lunch its not all that  there dinner menu is way better  i cant say dont eat there but if your planning on going here i highly recommend you for dinner 
be careful they charge extra dollars in the bill   i ordered my food yesterday from work  and in my break time i went to pick up my food  they messed up my order but other thing is they charge wrong amount in my bill  i m sure they did it intentionally by thinking most customer do not check their bills   they charged me extra  3 of my total  its not a mistake  its cheating i believe  i will never go there again 
i waited at the speaker for at least 2 minutes before someone came on the speaker  i ordered my food  carne assad fries  no guacamole and sour cream  i pull around the bend and there was a grey cadillac with a few people in it  they seemed to be friends with the drive thru person  they pull off within 15 seconds  i get to the window  it took at least 4 minutes before the guy came to the window to inform me  he put guac on my fries  meanwhile in my car  i can hear a female and other employees laughing and having a good time  my problem is  if they werent jacking around  they could have got my food right and not have me waiting in drive thru for 10 15 minutes  this isnt the first time  i work in this business  i know exactly how long it takes fries and meat to cook  horse play is great but not at the expense of a customer 
the food here is great  very authentic   the service however is horrible   two of us ate here on a saturday night  there were only two other tables and two waitresses  they both should be working somewhere else  preferably where they dont have contact with other people  their skills were really lacking for a hospitality business 
appetizers were ok  main course horrible   grilled lobster tails came out raw  they did bring another serving  these too were barely cooked    the halibut was similar to chewing on a shoe   for the prices they charge we will not be going back   it seems like everyone who goes there has been brainwashed to think they are getting a good meal 
dr  ortega gets 5 stars because she treats her patients with care   listens as well   however  the office is run very  very poorly in regards to filling prescriptions correctly   to top it off   today  monday  i called after not feeling well all weekend  and their phones were out its not the first time this has gone on im thinking maybe they dont want to take sick patients at all   i see the dr every 3 months for lab work etc    when im not feeling well  one expects the drs office to pick up their phones so i can get an appt   i drove over there and was told they were unable to see me today  over booked  and was also told to go to the er                         no the er is for emergencies not for possible bronchitis     then to top that i was told that  this is  not a walk in clinic now that blew my mind if their phones were working  i wouldnt have to  walk in  to be seen  i am digusted and the office staff should all be dismissed   this is the wild west dont get sick  
this place is the best corner store liquor place i could ask for  the staff are friendly and its always a pleasant experience  its a bit pricier than woodmans or another grocery  but id say its worth it for the convenience and experiencec 
my first breakfast in the city of montreal was spent here  it was a superb choice  i highly recommend the cinnamon chai tea as it was excellently made   i ordered the ham  egg  and cheese bagel sandwich with a side salad  the salad took a little getting used to but the bagel was a trophy in and of itself 
this mall isnt very good   many stores and most major tenants are closed or closing     one good point is at macys since they are closing up right now    feb 2015 theres great sales   the mall definitely needs to attract more stores and refresh or revamp itself  would not go back to this mall
save yourself some money and time   do not go there  they take literally 5 minutes to cut kids hair and if you point to them that hair line is not even they tell you  its just a curl   horrible service  pretty expensive for the quality provided  awful experience 
i just finished my second visit here and for the price it is still a good place to stay  some of the other casinos on this intersection are showing their age  but nyny is keeping up pretty well   i will probably stay here again if they continue to keep the promos going 
amazing selection and great staff  friendly and helpful is the way to go  i appreciate how the clerk took the time to let my wife try on many pairs until she found the right fit 
stopped in for brunch on a saturday while in town with family and we were not disappointed  i had the huevos rancheros  the pork was tender  the spices were perfect and not overpowering  and the portion was very generous  we sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive  i also had a sour cherry mimosa which was great  will definitely be back 
super friendly employees  even better cider  a gfer who misses beers dream  love the fighting elleck but watch out it will creep up on you  
i cant wait to come back and eat here  i just had drinks and they were divine  pic is banana infused bourbon   the atmosphere is great  this may be my new favorite watering hole 
terrible service  thats why ups is always a negative case study example for mba degree  terrible horrible 
i wish i could give them a zero star  service is terrible  i went to that store for the first time  they told me they only provided the most expensive car wash which is 140 dollars  and the guys has super rude attitude  terrible terrible terrible   
a very nice place for the money  the staff was very friendly and helpful and the accommodations were pretty good  its a somewhat older facility  hence the 4 star rating instead of 5    but it was very clean for what it is 
i came here with a friend and ordered a blt  w  o the bacon  and the chocolate chai latte in the evening  awesome that they serve breakfast all day  i love breakfast anytime of the day  the blt was simplistically good and the chocolate chai latte was perfectly delightful  their decor was scenic and almost  lounge  type of atmosphere  my friend and i were very comfortable  the staff were polite  the reason i gave it 4 stars was that there were some weird people around  we left around closing hours while we silently passed by a staff trying to wake up a possible drunk  stoned customer who had fallen asleep at one of the tables  thats downtown brampton for you  other than that  i would gladly come here again in the future   just not around closing hours 
met with jordan this morning    he was on time and super efficient   he fixed two wheels with curb rash and they look brand new   did both wheels in an hour     will definitely use him again and refer everyone to him   thanks jordan 
like all the reviews have said it   this place is the best shwarma place i have been to   very fast service and the taste of the food is amazing
im from chicago and this is definitely not chicago style  i should have gone to tacos el gordo  i was so disappointed 
we shared a stone crab appetizer  never had these before  they were okay   we were told that these were frozen from last season  since the season starts in october   we just didnt see the big deal with them    the highlight of my meal was the 2 lb  lobster  which they cracked for me   it was the best ever  and my wife loved her halibut dish   the spinach was terrific  also   all in all  a very rewarding and pleasant experience 
best italian for the money in vegas   we have tried 20  italian restaurants in places like palazzo and the wynn   la scala has several specials every day  a good wine list  great service and reasonable prices  so what more could you ask for 
was here on a monday after the lunch rush with a group of 6 other friends and we were squeezed into a small centre table when they were booths and we were a large group   they took a while to understand what we had wanted  which was very clear  and had to repeatedly come back and ask for clarification   when we ordered our first round  food came out relatively fast and tasted very nice   the sashimi was delicious and so were the wide assortment of meats and appetisers   however  as we went on  the food started coming out slower and slower to the point where we had to continuously remind the waiters of our food   by the time we had finished  there were significantly fewer people in the restaurant and many empty tables   at first  dessert came out relatively fast but as time went on  our table had ordered a few more desserts and they were completely forgotten   unfortunately  they also did not have the creme brulee at the time   once wed paid for the bill  we were waiting for the change as well as to give tip  but they totally disregarded that   we had to physically go up and remind them as they handed over our change and as we tipped them    we had ordered one plate of beef tataki but the server was giving us five  and we had told them wed only ordered one   the server simply said   let me see your ipad    we then showed her our ipad and she walked away looking extremely annoyed at us      all in all  the food was decent  decor and atmosphere were good  but service needed improvement   wait times were very long  especially when there were few people in the restaurant and many chefs on hand  five of them could be seen in the front of the restaurant    not my first choice  probably wont be back   if i could give them half stars  it would definitely be a 1 5  5
ok  so now every time i come to vegas i have to come to soho  the quality and imagination of dishes is comparable to the best sushi places on the strip  the atmosphere is friendly and service impeccable  i compare it to my favorite places in los angeles  i will always come here at least once every trip to vegas  john     ill finance a restraunt in bev hills if you want    
the actual doctors are amazing  it is the annoying employees on the  retail  side that are so slow  they seriously take forever to take care of customers and its seems like every time something is wrong finding my insurance when i have been here several times   and i came in with my husband and the lady was extremely  nice  to my husband which i thought was very unprofessional  i think vision works needs to come up with a faster system and teach there employees about the fine line of flirting and customer service  never coming here again 
first lets start off with the service  waitress julie b  was awesome  she was very warm and very quick on the welcome  she gave us our menus and our drinks were on the table in seconds  she gave us a little time to check out the menu then came to our rescue to tell us the best things to get  boy was she ever spot on    my wife and i started off with the intermezzo salad with the balsamic vinaigrette  i dont know about you  but i am not a salad eater  but this salad i could eat all day long  the sweet vinaigrette  and the home made mozzarella really set that badboy off  julie then ran off a list of her favorite items until we told her to stop at the pizza  we ordered half capriccioso and half intermezzo  and from then on it was nothing but lip smacking and finger lickin  i have had pizzas in ny  chicago  sf and plenty of other places in the us  but this little corner restraunt in charlotte is the best i have ever tasted  im not just saying this  try it for yourself  the crust was perfect y crispy and not too thin  nor too thick  they make the dough by hand  and all of the ingredients are fresh  you can taste the freshness as if you were in the garden when they pick  the basil and tomatos  after we downed the pizza it was dessert time  we got the crepe with bananas  strawberrys  and hazelnut choclate sauce and that immediately put me in heaven and didnt want to come down    if you havent been to this little hole in the wall spot  then please go  you will be back  you will find yourself forgetting about papa johns 
so ive been hearing a ton of buzz about this place and finally had time to check it with my girlfriend  this being an old italian place that has been remolded into some lively  warm  and inviting  i do admire beckett for trying to give people valus for money  using great local food   ironicly a friend from a local farm happen to notice me there while at dinner  while preparing is simply and comforting  i had for an app the sausage and grits whilemy gf had the grilled cheese and roasted red pepper soup  the sausage was fine and grits could have been more creamy for my taste  the grilled cheese was melted but i thought the soup to be a too sweet  yes i know roasting red bell will increase sweetness  for my taste  main courses were chicken and dumplings and the osso bucca  the chicken and dumplings were great  dumplings were light and sauce was nice but i wanted more chicken flavor and the raw celery overpowered the dish  the osso bucca was a different story altogether  the spatzel was good  seasoned nicely and light  the roasted root beg was nicely carmelized  the osso though was tender but lack a sauce  within five minutes the meat dried out  not saying bone dry but it wasnt lip smacking like it should have been   everyone seems so love this place but im not really blown away by it  i understand stand no cutting edge food is here but i really want to be happy after i leave and didnt get that sense after becketts table 
i came here for breakfast and really enjoyed their fresh breakfast  i also do like to have less choices and it was pleasing to look at their minimalist menu  the quality was good but the price was great for the portion 
there is nothing special about infuse cafe  everything is just very main stream  the teas which are the highlight here taste the same as tea  iced tea you can get at starbucks  they just have a fancy infuser which make it seem cool but the credit for that should be given to the infuser manufacturer  the service is great and quick  however the seating area is limited  not a good place to have a private conversation 
it is probably the best sport bar in the gta  the location and tv setup is as good as it gets  their food is also really good  they do need to work on their service though  waitresses seem to be confused a bit and run all over the place 
lets be honest  how many other bards and lounges in the city with this quality of space and a massive patio have no cover    
thank you  youre open right behind my house  now i can walk or even crawl to acquire the best french toast ive had in years    if you havent been here already  go here  they have a healthy side and the naughty  happy side  ive tried almost everything  theyve added some new things which is always refreshing   breakfast  lunch all day  errday   this place is going blow everything around it out of the water  hands down  super friendly staff  always clean atmosphere  i am so happy 
do they really even care about the reviews here  the staff is the most unfriendly starbucks staff ive ever encountered  all the reviews about this location are extremely true unfortunately i waited way too long for the staff to even acknowledge me and i was the only person in there while they were talking amongst themselves   almost every single staff member made eye contact with me knowing that i was waiting for someone to help    im sure they will be happy to hear that i will never be returning to this location which is a bummer because is the closest one to my house  crap way to start the day 
snippy  rude service  so bummed out because i usually love coming here   my girlfriend forgot to tell the barista we wanted our coffee iced  the girl pretty much made us feel like idiots and i watched her while she started talking about us to her co worker and i could read her lips saying  well  whatever  huffing and puffing that they had to remake our drinks  mind you it wasnt even that busy and we said they could just dump the drinks they made over ice  but they wouldnt listen to us just kept griping  the coffee is awesome  the place is cool to hangout at but wow   way to make your regulars feel like crap  at least say it when we walk away  
1 star because the food was good  but everything else was terrible  first thing they tell us after we made a reservation was that we had a certain amount of time before we had to leave because of the amount of reservations they had that night  are you kidding me    servers looked miserable  kinda slammed our plates down  turned right around and walked away  even other people that were helping the server didnt seem friendly at all  we felt like they hated that we were even there  service was slow  i will definitely never come back  i know they probably dont even care  but i hope it gets better for whoever else goes here  seems like it has awesome reviews but come on   why did good customer service go out the window lately  
i guess compared to the dmv id call this place fun  but i wouldnt describe it as enjoyable experience for me  i saw it on tv and it looked intriguing enough to give it a try  i lasted about 5 minutes and i was bored  and in a bit of pain   perhaps im too germ phobic  but landing face first in the co mingled sweat of hundreds of people was a bit much for me as well   next stop was cvs for a full body scrub down with hand sanitizer 
my friend and i are doing a great cupcake adventure  we are trying every cupcake place in vegas  and cupkates was the third bakery we tried  we were both super excited after reading the reviews online and seeing the website  sadly  it was a let down    to begin with  it looks nothing like a bakery  at first  we thought it was a boutique  but then we saw the mini cupcakes  we bought a dozen with six flavors  it was kind of disappointing because we like picking out what flavors i want  but we only had the option to buy the 12    there are two positives about the cupcakes  first  they are adorable  second  they are incredibley moist  unfortunately  that is where it stops  the flavors were very generic  and we could not tell one flavor from another  i think ive had grocery store cupcakes that tasted better  so far cupkates has received the lowest score  and we wont be going back    i can see how cupkates would be great for a cupcake tea party for little girls  but if you are an adult looking for a yummy cupcake  i would probably try somewhere else 
cute southern comfort spot tucked away in the venetian  the drink menu is awesome   probably  10 15 cocktails  many in mason jars  as well as an extensive beer and wine list  the dirty dog ipa was delicious     we split biscuits  homeade butter and jam on the side  as well as mac and cheese then each got an entree  i got the short rib with cauliflower mashed potatoes and string beans  my coworker got the shrimp and grits  very heavy food so be prepared   we had a 7pm reservation on a tues and it was pretty crowded so i suggest making one 
great food and customer service  will come back again    good ice cream too      groupon for mayo location   thank you
amazing restaurant  great food  great service  great ambiance   nick  our server  was the best 
car wash was great   got my windshield fixed because of chips in glass   auto glass express did a great job   kyle and katie did an amazing job  
this was one of the first places i dined at when i moved to phoenix and i was quite impressed  the green curry tasted very authentic and service was impeccable  its a must try 
not a big fan of chains but this coras is definitely an exception  tried a few around the gta and have to say best experience by far   friendly staff  yummy food and very accommodating  never been disappointed with my visits here  the menu is standard for all coras but the food at this location is always tastier  plus  love the add on options   like fried onions with the home fries which was first suggested by a server here  the etobicoke location had an issue with providing a booth  though there were many empty   stating they were for larger parties   never an issue here though  the only  ve is the long line at times   but its worth the wait 
new to the area and was looking for a good thai place  its the type of place youd probably drive by based on the outside  but i read the excellent reviews and decided id give it a chance   excellent food  we had pad see eow  yellow curry and cashew chicken  would recommend them all  and dont forget the thai iced coffee   so good
a good find during my visit to montreal  at this place you will find a choice of fried fish and fries  no complicated choices to make  everyone at my table ordered something different and we liked our food  i dont eat fried food often but was still pleased with my purchase 
bluf  i was full when i left  but felt like i paid too much   i went to big ben one sunday night primarily because it was within walking distance of tremont music hall  where i was going to a concert later that night  i ordered a steak and kidney pie  a glass of crispin  which happened to be on special that night  conveniently   and a slice of their sweet potato maple layered cheesecake    the pie was all right  but i discovered i wasnt a big fan of kidney  definitely shouldve gone for steak and mushroom instead  the sides that came with it were fine  but nothing special    the cheesecake  on the other hand  was very good  however  im not sure it was quite worth  8 a slice   in the end  the food was all very filling  but nothing special and not worth what i paid 
this place is the worse horrible customer service and fraudulent  dropped a package off there prepaid for fedex to pickup and they never delivered   they even charged me 1  to drop off a package   it sat there for 3 days before i finally had to go back and get the package and take to fedex myself   beware do not go there you will be screwed  
it was an amazing experience  the seafood was fresh and food came out quickly  i recommend this place when in vegas 
fun tasting menu experience   by no means perfect  but worth the  100  price given the quality of the ingredients and great flavor combinations   i wrote more about the food in the captions of the pictures  but the definitive highlights for me were the foie gras  the beef  and the dessert  so amazing in both textures and flavors   let downs included the scallops  the duck  and the bread   crab was decent  as was the butter  cant believe it was made  the same afternoon     the setting was pretty fantastic  with glass walls right next to the capitol so you can see the building lit up at night  elegant and dim  but not too dim   with great service   each person who presented the courses walked us through what components were present in the same even cadence   some minor quibbles  on the scallop dish it was obvious that the fingerprints had not been wiped off the dish  which was somewhat off putting  also  the timing of the courses varied dramatically  with some long pauses and others that had a dish right after another   not sure what happened there   overall  a great experience  though my bf thought there wasnt enough food  and would come again in the future 
15 bucks for pancakes   are they out of their mind   no   they were perfect   i have dreams about those pancakes 
great truly spicy lao food  as you may or may not know  laos is culturally very tied to parts of thailand  but has its own rich heritage  and the food shows both the similarity and the differences  the food here is delcious  love the sticky rice  love that the papaya salad comes with fried chicken    what a great combo 
when were in town we like to come here for the breakfast they have the best pancake ever its always cooked perfectly light golden  taste so yummy    we also get the breakfast buffet and thats pretty good too  the steak special is also really good   cooked perfect  oxtail soup is the best  but you have to get here early 
moving from hawaii my husband and i finally started missing home and its amazing food  we went to another hawaiian food place and the food was a 3  10 at best with some not so nice servers  when we came here it was really busy but the staff was friendly and handled the line well  guess theyre always busy and i can see why  not only was the food delicious the portion sizes were amazing for their prices  and it also tastes exactly like home from the kalua pork to the chicken katsu all the way down to the macaroni salad  definitely will be coming back for more
i tried it out because of the good reviews   i got the full pedicure   25   the nail and cuticle work were fine  but the callous removal was not   the full pedicure includes this  but he did not give my feet the attention or time they needed    and i left with feet that were still a little rough    all he would have needed to do is actually look at them while he worked instead of talking to his peer who was working on someone next to me   disappointing   came home and finished them myself    what a waste of   
when leaving the hoover dam  we decided to look for a quick bite    since the town was so small  we didnt think we would find anything interesting or decent   we found the dillinger on yelp   and it seemed to fit the bill  after reading the reviews  we decided to give it a try   the other reviews were spot on   the service was very friendly and knowledgable  the dillinger was exactly what we were looking for on our way back to vegas nothing too fancy  just a good beer and burger 
my boyfriend gets his haircut here and so i am writing the review for him   he went back to this place after a few years of being gone and he had forgotten how great this place is   he said he wouldnt go anywhere else again   highly recommend 
amazing jerk chicken  peas and rice  mac and cheese all excellent   this is authentic jamaican food that is just like jamaica  
the las vegas defense has been wonderful  they have been by my side throughout my case and have really put me at ease  very professional and knowledgeable  i would recommend them to anyone who needs legal help  i would not have wanted to try and manage my case without them 
nice atmosphere   new concept in wine drinking  they have great wine selections but need more staffing  i was asked how much would i like to spend as i walked through the door and that was a turn off  not sure if i will go back  thx  dr md
would highly recommend metropolitan 9    i had a great time    visited the roof top bar which sure adds a lot of character to the place    the view is beautiful and the wines and food are excellent   a very special  thanks  to olivia who works at the bar    she was so personable and made our bar and dinning experience an amazing one    she is truly a very dedicated worker and i was very happy to meet her    she attended to all our needs inspite of being so busy she made sure we were having a great time    thank you olivia for making it a great evening for us     sincerely dr md
highly recommend a meal at onoir   the experience starts off in the small bar when you walk into the restaurant   thats where you look over the menu  place your order and they answer any questions you may have   they also have you out your jackets and anything that may create light  cell phone  watch  etc  into a locker    from there you line up outside the door to enter a mid room   you put your arms on the shoulder of the person in front of you and walk in a line into the mid room  the mid room is there to ensure no light enters the main dining room    once everyone is in the mid room and its dark the server takes you into the main dining room and guides you to your seat     the food itself is excellent   you have a choice of two items  appetizer  main or desert  for  36 or all three for  42   all of the food everyone had at our table was excellent     highly recommend a visit and will return 
very very good  i got takeout lamb mughlai  fresh and tender  i will stop in again  the location is fairly easy to get to and parking wasnt a problem 
feb 2016     gross  both in racism and filth    had to ask the maid for spray to wipe down the fridge and then was accused of trying to  keep it from the maid  or     stealing the spray    tried to reason with the fake manager and had to walk off from her rude tone and threats  got my refund  guarantee you that  just cancel your res and go down to the tuscany  its great  foods great  rooms are  effword  awesome  smoking or non smoking  dusty curtain closet not included  this extended stay is terrible     
the food here is adequate  the drinks are fine  the service is decent to bordering on non existent depending on who is serving you  its a nice space with a lovely back patio  but the clientele are what keeps this restaurant on my do not ever go in streetsville list   every time i have attempted to relax on their patio with a drink and a bite to eat  as a woman alone  i have been harassed by the customers of this place   the last occurrence was so egregious i left near tears  i have not been back since  but on previous occasions when i have been with my husband we were bothered by the patrons    people playing music out loud on their phones and just being generally very rowdy and rude    it is unfortunate this place attracts who it does  i watched  disappointed  when this building was midtown restaurant and it closed because nobody appreciated it   it has been through a few changes since then  all going under because the only people who it draws  fairly or unfairly  is degenerates 
i really  really want to stan for a restaurant in the 905 but they just keep missing the mark  this place is new and ill give it another shot  but i dont think theyve found their niche yet   is it a gastro pub  fine dining  a club  not sure yet   the service was mixed  server was definitely eager to start  but mispronounced just about everything we ordered  both wine and food  some more training might be in order   as the evening wore on  he completely forgot about us for long stretches at a time and let us sit with empty glasses for 15 minutes  he was however prompt with getting our bill and settling us up   we ordered the bang bang shrimp since we snuck in for happy hour just before 7 00  which was a good dish  deep fried  breaded  butterflied shrimp in a sweet and spicy sauce with some cooling arugula on top   for mains  my husband ordered the duck confit and i wasnt terribly hungry so i tried the grilled octopus with russian salad   all my instincts told me to just go with a typical pub dish but we thought wed give the stuff punching up a shot   the duck confit was inedibly salty   to the servers credit  he actually gave us a gentle warning about it beforehand     the duck is marinated in salt for 24 hours  which gives it an    interesting taste  id recommend you eat it with the red cabbage slaw      there have obviously been complaints   tone the salt down on this one  guys  i didnt eat most of my grilled octopus because the three bites i attempted took a few minutes a piece to chew and swallow  if youre going to serve octopus that rubbery  at least give me a steak knife   the russian salad ended up being my dinner   basically a creamy beet and potato salad  nice concept but woefully under seasoned   i saw burgers  poutine  and fish and chips going to other diners that looked really great and ill return with the hopes that this place will fill a need in ssauga for better than average pub food with a nice beer and wine selection  it could use 50  more canadian wines  a  5 tawse riesling at happy hour was the highlight of the experience  in an upbeat atmosphere 
i purchased a chevy 383 stroker for my project from chris  being my first project car  i had reservations  chris made the process easy and explained everything to me  from the start everything said he would do was done  delivery was on time  the motor was great  they even offer a dyno package which i recommend  it was a fun experience    this is my first review ever  of anything  i felt compelled to leave a good review after the post sale service i received  the motor seemed to have an issue with it  after having the project sent to chris  without hesitation he took care of the problem  thats customer service    they build great engines  have excellent post sale service  and the prices are fair  you get much more than you pay for at 5 star   great company  great product  most of all great service  i will buy the next engine from them and if you need a new engine chris is your guy   thank you chris 
i absolutely love the ambiance of this place  the bar area is very large  and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot  a solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back  it doesnt generally get very crowded  even on friday and saturday nights   so dont expect a south side type of environment    all that being said  there is a reason why this is a two star review  even though this place doesnt get crowded  it takes a very long time to get served  i have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar 
my daughter and i had a mother daughter a package as mothers day gift   we both had swedish massages and we both had hydro facials by esthetician bandt   we both left feeling refreshed and very relaxed looking forward to our next visit to finish our package  thank you we both needed it 
this sally beauty supply is located in boca park right next to target  i love that i can go to target and then stop over to sallys  its a smaller store but they have an array of hair care products and a very large assortment of beauty products  i have been going to this store for a couple of years and each time i come in for one thing but end up buying more things than anticipated  the employees that work in the store are always helpful and ask if i im looking for anything in particular and go out of their way to find it for me  a couple of days ago i went in for hair color and the guy that helped me was really awesome   his name was jarret and he was very professional and very knowledgeable about hair color  he recommended a hair color to compliment my skin tone and my personality  i also picked up some nail polishes as well  i explained to jarret that i needed a moisturizing lotion for my hands they get extremely dry now that its cold outside and they are cracking  he was able to get me a hand lotion that smells amazing and works very well  i will definitely be going back to get more stuff in a week or so  if you want good products and service dont think twice on coming to this sally beauty location 
my second time staying here and it was a blast  i went on a quick get away with my hubby and not only did we win there we loved the room  we have stayed there previously in the new tower deluxe room and it was nice as well  we just enjoyed the nostalgic feel of the pyramid rooms  although it was a bit more noisey and the wi fi was not the best luxor needs to update their wifi a bit  will be staying again 
i needed a spare key for my lexus  the dealer told me it would cost around  450 for the key and programming  i called lockout services based on their great yelp reviews  i spoke with jimmy and gave him my vehicle info  he called me right back and gave me a price which was less than half of what the dealer quoted  we set an appointment for the next day  he showed up right on time  jimmy not only cut my new key and programmed it  he reprogrammed my valet key which no longer worked at no charge  jimmy was very friendly  knowledgeable  and easy to work with  i will use them for all my locksmith needs and would definitely recommend them to others 
food was good  a bit generic for tex mex  but tasty all the same  the drinks were top notch  service was good even though a bit slow  i wasnt a huge fan of the ambience and the blaring 80s  90s music  but overall worth a stop if youre in vegas 
charla was nothing but sweet  warm and knowledgable  she made my first time so comfortable that i found myself planning all of my other treatments with her  she has an eye for naturalness which is important to me and is very gentle with her applications  im so glad we found each other  a  
great food  love this place  have tried about 10 different things on the menu  everyone was a winner  there are people that i do business with that are from orlando  and they insist that we go every time they are here 
absolutely fantastic  as good as it gets  i am totally and completely addicted  will be a regular 
they staff was very friendly and reassuring  i have a 90lb hyperactive pit bull who absolutely hates the vet  she was there to get her stitches removed from a leg surgery  they told me it could take anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes  i took less than 4  i downloaded the yelp app just so i could leave these guys a great review  if your pet end up there  they are in good hands 
omg this place is so good  best persian food in town  the service is great and its vegetarian friendly too 
this is seriously the best pizza place in town  were glad we found it  the pizza and wings are so good  theyre consistent and definitely put love into their food 
quality beats quantity     this store has the highest quality record collection i have seen   they keep shoppers updated on their newly received new and used records via twitter and facebook status which helps to know what is in stock   this alone keeps them at a higher rating than other record stores in clt 
ive eaten here multiple times and sometimes i really enjoy it  and the half off bottle of wine  and sometimes im not as pleased   i have enjoyed the bagel deluxe roll     their tuna  maguro  ngiri seemed fresh but there wasnt enough of it   it was a very thin slice of tuna on a large piece of rice    just not exactly what i was expecting   the atmosphere is nice and can be quiet on the right night   
this location really let me down today  i have been here before so it really surprised me  let me tell you about it  they had just opened so i was excited to be their first customer  the staff was working on a big togo order  so i felt like i wasnt appreciated as a customer  my tacos were thrown together and the pinto bean juice wasnt even drained so it caused my tacos to be all mushy and my tortillas were falling apart  when i asked for salsa the guy put a lot on it  so it looked like i had more salsa than chicken    i was a little sad because they should have  given the same respect and service  to me like they were giving the togo order  just because i didnt spend as much doesnt  mean my food should have  been rushed and given horrible service 
i was super impressed with this location  it wasnt messy and clothes werent thrown everywhere  i could actually shop and not feel like i was stepping on or tripping over clothes on the floor  the store was set up great  if i wanted black dresses i found different styles of black dresses in one area  red dresses were all located in one area too   you get the idea    great selection of clothes plus awesome prices    my only complaint is that i felt the dressing rooms could have been cleaner  its okay to vacuum or sweep the floors staff  why would i want my feet to touch a dirty floor 
came on july 4th  how americana is that    had another fabulous time here  i brought my nephew who had never here  he loved it  staff was great  the fans and misters were working hard too  this is a place to have fun  eat awesome food and shoot some golf balls 
red lobster has never let me down  the baked potato soup was very delicious  the service was great  very friendly server who was checking up on us constantly and making sure we had everything we needed  i will be back
my new favorite pizza spot   the white top pizza is amazing   i add chicken to mine to make it even tastier  the blood orange lemonade really hits the spot on a hot vegas summer day  cant wait to try a new creation of my own from the build your own menu  
i was sick for 2 days after eating from this restaurant  never again  the food was delivered about an hour after i ordered it and it was barely warm   i ordered a chicken entree  a noodle entree and egg rolls  the egg rolls were good  the rest of the food was average and they use a lot of large pieces of garlic in their dishes  not even an hour later i was very sick with stomach problems  it took me 2 days to feel better after i ate from here  ill stick with my usual chinese spot from now on 
ive been here a number of times and there are always lots of people eating here so keep that in mind because maybe its just me thats not impressed  the staff is fine  the decor is a slightly strange mix of industrial and tuscan but thats fine    the real problem for me is the food  ive never been to an italian restaurant that is so obsessed with fried food  even though the menu doesnt specify  almost every entree ive had has been battered and fried  the only difference is they throw a sauce and a few vegetables on it  also  or maybe because of this   its really salty  salads are just so so  not a lot of fresh ingredients here 
this used to be the irish heritage center but was bought by aherns and renovated  the top priorities for me when choosing a wedding reception site were  1  convenient location for my guests  2  classy  comfortable space  3  really good food  its really a glorified dinner party  isnt it      and 4  competent staff  aherns is all of these things and they made our reception this past february truly fantastic   lucy is the no nonesense  very capable manager  she essentially served as our personal party planner before and during the event and took care of everything  communicating with the other vendors  dj  photographer  florist  etc   and making sure the party continued to progress so we could just sit back and enjoy our guests  aherns is their own caterer and can do either a sit down meal or buffet  or cocktail reception  with almost endless entree options  we went with the buffet and an open bar so guests could enjoy as much or little as they wanted and it worked perfectly  i think we were pretty low key but did have a few special requests and they were professionally executed by the staff   there are two banquet halls of different sizes but they have separate entrances and bathrooms and a service hallway runs between them so you wouldnt even notice if another event was happening during yours  the halls are already very elegant so we didnt spend any money on decorating other than flower centerpieces but the space could certainly accommodate any over the top additions you might want 
i love breakfast sandwiches  i dont know what it is but i just cant get enough   their borderline wrap is great   its scrambled eggs  cheese and your choice of meat wrapped in a tortilla and served with salsa  i substitute breakfast potatoes for the chips  who eats chips  anyway   and always leave so satisfied  its a pretty small place so try to time your arrival either early or late to miss the crowd 
there are a number of specialty ice cream stores in cleveland  mitchells  in my opinion  is by far the best  its delicious and chocked full of ingredients like fresh fruit  cheesecake  chocolate chunks  etc  the frozen yogurt  sorbet and milkshakes are also so satisfying  theyve really stepped up their game in the past few years by offering homemade whipped cream and choosing local ingredients whenever possible   plus whoever trains all those teenyboppers who work there is awesome because their customer service skills are incredible  i also think the prices are less than other specialty stores but the product is of a better quality    this place of course attracts a lot of kids but theyre usually supervised and dont stay long  even when the line looks gigantic  you wont have to wait long  they also have pints and ice cream cakes  pies for sale 
meh   i dont get the stellar reviews   its fine  but its loud and there is almost always a wait for some reason   its overpriced for breakfast food   the food is fine  but i wouldnt say fabulous   the staff is always in a rush   for me  the noisy environment and the price keep me from going back 
do not go to this cleaner if you expect the service they promise you on the phone   they almost ruined my wedding due to their incompetence       for our wedding my husband and i flew to las vegas   i needed to get my wedding dress pressed  not cleaned  just pressed  and i called master cleaners the week before we were to leave   i explained that we would be flying into vegas on a friday and i needed the dress pressed no later than 10am the next morning   i gave them the dates we would need their services  which happened to be good friday and that sat   and they said no problem   they promised they would be able to get the dressed pressed and ready by 5pm that same day   we flew in and headed straight to master cleaners   once there we were told that their pressers were not available due to the holiday and would not be back til monday   obviously monday was not going to work for me since our wedding was the next day   they absolutely refused to help us even though they had promised to do so just a week early   well after running around to two other cleaners that were also not accepting business for the holiday and running up a very high taxi meter we decided to go back to the hotel and try to press the dress ourselves   thankfully my husband to be knew how to use an iron  i thought they were decorative doorstops    we managed to press the dress fairly well   moral of the story  watch out for any promises master cleaners gives you 
best wings ive had in charlotte so far  cajun ranch is amazing   
so i needed to update my review     the last time i came i enjoyed it okay but wanted to try it one more time with more of an open mind  this place is hyped up so much and i couldnt understand why    well now i do  i ordered my food on the phone for pickup  food was ready when i got there im less than 10 minutes  the service was excellent and everyone was friendly  for me that goes a long way  i got the kids meal with pulled chicken and cilantro rice  excellent choice  it even comes with a drink including the speciality drinks  i appreciate that  dont limit me to fountain drinks im here because i want to try what makes you stand out  they allowed me to sample them which was great  my favorite was the purple one   it has a hint of cinnamon     very appropriate for the winter  and the food was just enough   if you are not super hungry you will do good with the kids meal  i had a little leftover  my favorite sauce is the orange and yellow i mixed it all in the rice and chicken  delicious          it was so fresh and flavorful but beware as the sauce can be a little spicy which i like   so although i was trying not to join the hype of this place i have   nothing beats excellent service and excellent food with a good price  try them out 
i just got a hot tea and to be there with friends  gkkd easy service and welcoming atmosphere
be prepared to wait even if you are the only customer  but its worth it  the food is made to order and tastes homemade  i love the refried black beans  my husband and i usually share the sampler platter   we love the variety  the food is interesting  for instance  a pickled cabbage slaw is served with all dishes  the plantain chips  stuffed pepper  papusas  and ceviche with fresh chips are also good  the only thing i havent loved was the onion chicken  i definitely recommend if you are in the neighborhood 
this place is the best local pizza weve found   everything is always hot and fresh   also love their tally tuesday special 
called and had a tech out to look at and fix my garage door within 2 hours   ct  the tech  was quick and professional   thank you 
thrifty has an interesting business model   they advertise low daily rental rates which on the surface are enticing   in reality they are misleading to a renter who is used to looking at a per day fee that includes all of the additional fees and charges included with a normal rental   in any case  i was a business renter trying to keep my travel expenses to a minimum  but because i was visiting 4 different properties over 3 days  100 miles  i had reserved navigation to get me from phoenix to north scottsdale to tempe   once i got to thrifty  they told me that they had given all of their navigation units away   mind you this was at 8 00 pm on april 19   i had made the reservation on april 6   the only solution was to ask me to take a seat and wait for a unit that might be returned   wtf      i was left with no choice but to leave the rental compound with no navigation and no compensation for the obvious error on the part of thrifty   oh wait  they did offer 10  off on my next rental   hahahahahahahaha     like that will ever happen   boo to thrifty and the unempowered counter staff   you got my trip off on the wrong foot and i just wanted to share so that others can make a more informed decision about what rental car company they want to deal with 
yummy        i loceeeee thier hot n juicy sauce with their boil shrimp its so good and so spicy    im not really big on crawfish at all so i never really eat it or order it when i go there 
weve going to grimaldis for the past 2 years or more  i cant say enough about audrey  she anticipates our needs and always have a smile and of course  our drinks ready  if it wasnt for her i dont know if we would continue to be patrons there  the pizzas good but the bartenders even better  thanks audrey for all the service youve put in customer service 
was walking in the neighborhood and thought id get a quick bite from this restaurant  looked over their daily special and decided to get the steak dinner with black pepper sauce   i have to say i was surprised with what i got  the portion was more than generous  steak was done on point with the black pepper sauce  and with the dish i also got rice   two eggs and side veggies  steamed broccoli   i left the place with an empty plate and got their hong kong style tea   i was glad that i spent less than  16 including tax and tip  couldnt ask for more for a simple  delicious  and affordable dinner  i will be going back to try their other dishes 
found 2 pair of slacks  black and grey  as well as a brand new pair of dress shoes for  19 63   that truly cannot be beat   never would have i thought id come upon such an amazing find   i now have a new perspective about the goodwill and i will most definitely be coming back 
super yummy greek salad with chicken   perfect size to fill you up and its literally the fastest  fast food  ive had 
their food is great  my friends love eating here because they have amazing flavor filled original pizzas  however that doesnt work for me  so sad to see there are no gluten free pizza options  come on please add this to the menu  so many other places now do it like 800 degrees  which is down the street  when i saw you didnt offer gf we opted to eat there instead so i could enjoy some tasty pizza with gf crust 
from all that id heard about the food here  i was quite disappointed  the best thing about the dinner me n my friend grabbed here was the blue moon   which is hard to get wrong  we ordered chilli fries and the capone  nothing significant worth mentioning about the fries  the meat in the tall boy had a good flavor to it  thankfully  service was poor as our server was rough and kept practically throwing things onto the table while serving  wouldnt visit the market place spot again 
saturday night at sandbar was an interesting experience   im not sure ive ever seen so many people who looked alike in one place   ok  maybe i have   i have been to axis   radius    this place was wall to wall people   there was an overabundance of girls with the same  edgy  hair cuts  colors  who looked like they had the same tattoo artist   that comment actually holds true for the guys as well   i lost count of how many ramones t shirts i saw  and then there were the  keep calm and carry on  t shirts some guys were sporting   i see that saying on mugs a lot  so i was entertained that it was the shirt of choice for picking up chicks on a saturday night  and was left wondering if these guys even knew the origin of that saying     like so many others places  the bouncers seemed to be the hottest guys there   i can honestly say this place is not my scene   it almost made me miss the sandbar in scottsdale   i never really liked that place  but i did have some hilariously good times there 
a few months back  my friends and i stopped by majerles on a birthday pub crawl   it was a saturday night  and was not really crowded  yet it was apparent that the two very young blonde bartenders were struggling to keep up     although half the bar was empty  it took more than 20 minutes to get the bartender to take our order   she made us repeat the order twice  and still failed to get it right   it was a mixed drink  a beer  and a glass of water   i was the one looking for the water  it was hot and i needed hydration   of course she brings everything over but the water  and as she turns to walk away i try several times to stop her  with seemingly offensive terms as  excuse me   and  miss    while she continues to ignore me  i throw my arm up in the air  waving my hand  still trying to get her attention   finally i start snapping  which instantly gets a response   i ask her  nicely  even though im seriously annoyed at this point  if she could please get me a glass of water   you shouldve have seen the look this girl gave me   straight out daggers   she pours my water  slams it on the bar and says  dont ever snap at me again    turns around  and storms off   i was so stunned  i actually was speechless for a solid minute  and anyone who knows me  would know rendering me speechless is quite the feat   apparently i have a lot of nerve asking for the water she forgot to bring in the first place     i drank my water and we promptly left   with attitude and service like that  i dont know how this place will survive  but best of luck to you   ill be busy visiting the surrounding bars where i can actually get a drink  sans the ridiculously bitchy attitude 
this place is awesome  if you love chocolate this is the place for you to go  on top of that  their regular food is actually quite good and both all of their chocolate and non chocolate foods are good  the only complaint is that their tables are too damn small to use  theyre just annoyingly small  thats the only thing this place needs to change  their breakfast and teas  coffees  hotchocolates are to be had with every meal  regardless of time of day 
if your are looking for a breakfast place that is somewhat plain  but easily accessible with good food  this is a place to go  when searching i expected a place with  harvest  in its name to trend toward health food and grains   but this is a good solid place     my wife had the harvest omelet which had mushrooms  peppers  onions  tomatoes and spinach   no meat but they have meat omelets as well  she really enjoyed it   i had the bacon or sausage skillet with the sausage option   in addition to the main ingredients there were two over easy  my choice  eggs on top   being gluten intolerant all i missed was the toast  no biggie     the servings were generous and neither of us could finish our meals  although i did cherry pick the sausage pieces our of my remnant portion making it unsuitable for a take away box  their menu which is posted on line is extensive and should have something for everybody who wants a hearty breakfast    the service was prompt and courteous   when we arrived  late again  it was seat yourself so we had no trouble getting in   they had filled up pretty well by the time we left  but it doesnt seem to be a place that typically has long waiting lines   something we really appreciate as my wife has knee issues     the decor is somewhat plain  but if you are looking for a place for good food at a reasonable price and not an art gallery this is the place 
typical 7 eleven  i came in to buy a prepaid visa gift card  but they dont sell any over  200  my american card was giving me issues   good news  i ended up with 2 rockstar energy drinks  they were 2 for  4     
right next to las vegas airport  great location if you are coming or leaving   the food was very good and the service was average  basically a nice restaurant for dinner 
black cod lettuce wraps  calamari with jalepano  garlic yellowtail sashimi  and bubbies green tea and lychee mochi   we stumbled on this place after yelping  and it doesnt disappoint  the staff is great  and sit at the sushi bar for the best service  and great suggestions 
service was absolutely horrible   a group of women came into the bar on a saturday night to grab a drink and we were all charged gratuity at the bar   ive never heard of this before  i think most bars should expect to have separate tabs as you order your drink separately and the time it took to get a drink was beyond lousy 
we went here for our monthly girls dinner back in the summer and was overly impressed  the food was wonderful  first off bread and pesto was brought out to the table  we shared a few tomato basil salads  with freshly made buffalo mozzarella  and everyone raved about the freshness of the cheese  i had ordered the veal special and i wasnt disappointed with the meal even though it was quite pricey at  27  it was a meal worth paying that much for    we can get quite rowdy as the wine starts flowing  and ill mention there were good selections of half off bottles of wine on thursday nights  and the server only added to our great time  as a thank you we got a few complimentary desserts to share    the atmosphere isnt quite lively but its a quaint quiet place to go for a romantic dinner  we were probably out of our place with our group of 10 but it worked out great for the night 
we like the variety and taste of dishes at chilis  the only downside is their cleanliness  most of the time i feel disgusted looking at how they dont cleanup the dining area  its a mess on the floor and also the way they handle food 
spacious salon and always had a good hair cut 
my husband and i were married in the victorian chapel at chapel of the flowers on feb 12th  the staff was very nice and helpful  the chapel grounds are very pretty  lots of pretty scenery for pictures  my husband and i didnt have to worry about anything  we were picked up and led through the ceremony then straight to pictures  my bouquet was done so beautifully had 18 red roses  the package i had came with 6 roses but i wanted a huge bouquet so i bought a different bouquet 6 rose bouquet is very nice as well  with black ribbon  everything ran so smoothly  i couldnt have asked for anything more   i was afraid that their fleet was going to be crappy since most of the chapels in vegas have old limos and small itty bitty chapels but this place is just gorgeous  if you want to have a small wedding without the glitz and glam of vegas then this is the place to do that 
it was ok they sent us to our room there was a naked man in the room    back to the front desk for a new room   the new room was nice and the bed is soft   does not have a refrigator or microwave        the pool is across the street you have to walk for ever   the trucks for the hotel unload right beside the  fence and have  to smell and hear semi trucks all day and beep beep beep everytime they back up   it is so loud you can not even talk to each other   they need to put a 12   20  foot wall around the whole area and make a garden area around it  the area would be nice if they  closed a few  service roads and changed there traffic so you can relax and enjoy the pool   the buffet was a one the food tasted like they opened the cans and put it into the pans no home cooking or flavor at all   the desserts were all store pies and cakes and cookies it was really sad   they should just give you the buffet for free with the room   the best things were krispy kreme   auntie annes  mcdonalds  
this review is for the pool bar service   been here quite a few times and love the place but the pool servers are totally inattentive  we use the pool a lot and make at least six visits each year   the servers sit at the end of the bar and chat to each other and pay very little attention to the people at the pool wanting drinks and food   we have had to get out of the pool walk to the bar and ask for service   we talked to the servers but they gave us attitude   come on guys get your act together 
if you go to romados dont wait for a fancy place but for excellent food  this is by far the best barbecued chicken place in montreal  saint hubert  scores and other are great places for chicken but romados takes it to a new level  if you can call before you arrive you will avoid the lineup and will get your chicken faster  the sizes of the portions are unreal and the complementary  pastel de nata   portuguese custard pie  and small bun make this meal a true portuguese experience  i keep returning to romados as the service is also amazing  a little trick  while they are serving you at the counter make sure you place heavy coins on the wooden tip box and your portion may even increase  ehehe  if you buy portions for parties dont be surprised if you pay for 6 chicken and they give you seven  romados is the best charcoal barbecue chicken in quebec 
another great discovery   i ordered cupcakes to go for my birthday and decided to sit down a minute and enjoy one or two on the spot  all the flavours were delicious  moist and not overly sweet   its been so hard finding great and moderately priced vegan cupcake in montreal   i hope they add macaroons to their menu soon  i look forward to going back again so i can try their cookies and carrot cake   i cant wait to take my non vegan friends  just so they can experience these delicious treats   highly recommended to vegans and non vegans 
1   good soup  2   ok sandwich  3   too expensive   and again  too expensive  4   slow service  5   annoying layout and seating options   and the last time there  one of the dudes behind the counter barked at my colleauge when he tried to return his tray to the counter area when he was done    hey buddy  the trash is over there    really dude   come on 
bryan is awesome  he is very friendly and he is very thorough and patient  he does a great job and he will not let the vehicle go till he thinks its perfect  i will always return to him and refer him to people i know or meet  he is a family man  with a great passion for what he does 
took some friends from out of town here for a happy hour and sat in the bar area for cocktails and to enjoy the view   ambiance is great  service was a little slow but the cocktails were great  i enjoyed the chocolate old fashion which was amazing 
i have been going here for my annual eye exam for last 3 years   staff is friendly and dr  mumford really takes the time to go over everything and explain everything and address any concerns i have   i never feel rushed or pressure to buy   i feel like she is one of the few doctors ive been to that actually listen to the patient   everything is neat and tidy and they keep their equipment up to date   love this little gem   highly recommended 
the best part of this place  besides the friendly  up beat  information staff and great coffee is that they serve their iced coffee in a mason jar with crushed ice   love it
seems people either love it or hate it  were on the love it side  their are lots of burger places in the neighbourhood but my girlfriend and i agree this is one of the best weve been to so far 
this place just opened  and id say skip it  fish was pretty fresh but way undersized  not enough fish in the rolls  salad dressing wasnt very good either  overpriced for what it is 
michael the tech  guy was very  professional  polite  and clean  my a  c unit needed a tune up  and he also fund some issues with the unit  he gave me a quote for the extra work  but i was never pushed to do it  michael explained to me with details every question i asked   i recommend alaskan home
now  let me preface this by saying this is not going to be your least costly experience shopping  but it will provide you with the most variety of unusual gifts and decorative items   we come once a year from out of state to shop  we have family here and a sister who used to live near the  store is who introduced me to the black lion experience and it has been a love affair ever since   this store consists of several different booths in an old k mart store  one booth may be full of antique purple glass bottles and another all sports memorabilia  the selection is wide and varied and could easily take all day to see    i cant tell you how many times i hear  thats so  cute  where did you get it  to which i reply  black lion  
have you ever went to a place and you are like where in the world is it  but when you roll up your like  oh this spots gonna be good i just know it   well yeah i got that feeling after finding out about this exclusive spot  they have delicious big margaritas go for  8 per and  5 per during happy hour  they have margarita flights which i highly recommend for a group of friends theyre 3 for  15  the fresh salsa had a medium kick and good flavor   house made chips were bomb just needed a touch of salt  some of the best chips and salsa ive had in awhile id honestly buy it to take home  for my food i got a steak burrito that was topped with queso and ask for them to put a little guacamole in the burrito for a few bucks and the fresh guacamole makes it amazing  ive been there twice now back to back days after first trying it with friends who also loved it  they got the quesadillas and they were huge 12 inches 
order the chicken parm with the two sides both pasta and you got two meals  the portion size is huge  but for  16 im not complaining  this place is so good i took my family here when they came to visit and theyve taken me there ever since  the only thing i didnt care for was that you have to bring your own beer or wine  i just wish i could order it there however now i know  this is honestly one of the freshest  most delicious chicken parms ive ever had and ive had a lot of italian food from all over the country  this place isnt classified as an italian place but it couldve fooled me for sure  the cajun grilled chicken sandwich is bomb as well  i can see why this place is known so well by locals i look forward to getting my chicken parm there soon 
came in for a happy hour on a wednesday which mean 20  off the entire ticket   staff was very friendly happy hour apps were solid  mac   cheese balls  flautas  chips and salsa  and they had sonoran white chocolate   staff was extremely friendly and attentive  have a great patio and some indoor space for those really hot days 
fun sports bar with tons of tvs and can get extremely busy  also food is a little better than you would expect at your typical bar    watched game 1 of the finals there with an out of town friend  wait was crazy for a table  hour and a half   but found space to stand at the bar until a few spots opened up  both had a few beer and burgers which were really solid    maybe a few more bucks than your average sports bar but due to the quality of the food and space i think it is well worth it 
let me start off by saying this  i dont like their large  regular  cupcakes  ive never eaten a whole one but even split in half  theres too much icing in relation to cake and the cake itself seems a little drier in this form   but  their mini cupcakes are wonderful  each bite gets you a perfect mix of icing and moist cake  get a whole bunch  they come in the cutest boxes  and share them with friends and coworkers  i dont think ive had a flavour i didnt enjoy  but i could have a vanilla  vanilla any day of the week  they also have weekly special flavours  theyre not all winners  but there are a couple ive had that i wished were permanent    smores and pumpkin spice come to mind   if you have gluten intolerant friends  you should get to know this place  their gluten free cupcake is so good  you wouldnt know it if they didnt specifically tell you it was made without gluten   and finally  to the reviewers below who said their cupcakes werent different from store bought  regardless of flavour  the biggest and most important difference is that prairie girl uses real eggs  real butter  and not the crap they put into store packaged food with unpronounceable hydro whatever ingredients and a best before date a week from now   its okay to indulge every now and then  and if you like cupcakes  prairie girl is a good place to do it 
we had  guacamole with fried tortilla and yucca chips   pork rinds  handheld caesar salad  steak tacos and gobernador tacos  you assemble the caesar salad wraps in bibb lettuce leaves and the bacon is amazing  the dish was a standout for me because its notably different    everything else was really great   just the right amount of flavour and fresh  fresh  fresh  i can see some people finding it plain or boring  i e  not spicy or salty enough  but for me  this is simple mexican food at its best  and its something we dont get enough of in this city 
excellent and fast service  we bought a 2004 accord which came with one remote key  the previous owner also changed out the ignition switch  so the remote key only fit the ignition  not the doors  backseat lock or trunk  i bought a blank remote key online  levi cut and reprogrammed the new remote and also made two door keys  which was cheaper than changing door  trunk and backseat locks   price was reasonable and service was fast and friendly 
love this place   flavours are so creative and fun     came here for the first time a week ago and there was a huge crowd already hanging out outside   gelato flavours rotate so theres always lots of options  and lots of reasons to keep coming back   staff were super nice in letting me try tons of flavours 
my wife and i have been looking for a good italian place in the area for some time  another couple took us to dinner at pasta brioni  theyve been going there for years and raved about the place    the bread served before the meal was very good and warm  much to my liking   before the main meal  we ordered a caesar salad  the salad was good  but nothing exceptional  the salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal    the pasta and pasta sauce was very good  i went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese   the dish was very good and had lots of food    after filling up on bread  salad and our meal  we couldnt go for dessert  but split one  we had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell  with hazlenut with whipped cream  the dessert was really good  i couldnt have eaten the dish by myself  but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side   nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area  the decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening    service was very good  the waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner   i plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes  
the staff is always friendly and helpful if you need to locate an item   there are many great items to choose from here and the prices are very affordable  i think the one exception is some fruits and vegtables can be a little expensive for the amount you get  i normally dont shop for produce  depending on the time of year  they have some real good prices on blackberries and strawberries   i would encourage you to try the flat bread or pita bread with tjs hummus and the pizza dough and sauce to make your own pizza at home   tjs also has a wide selection of wine and beer that would fit almost any budget 
we went to jade palace on a thursday for lunch   purchased an nice bottle  of pinot grigio to go with our choices off the lunch menu   we had moo goo gai pan and chicken lo mein  they always have excellent food  service was beyond excellent  the two staff members kept an eye out for our every need   in fact i am going for p   u of the same food choices right now   need i say more 
this postinos could be might favorite place to hang out  but no espresso machine   what gives  i go to the postinos on central and they have an espresso machine  in fact  i went the central location today  i was informed that they are the only location that has an espresso machine  come on executive management this is the 21st century   now in reference to jason castro the manager at the kierans location   he was fantastic  he went out of his way to gratify my needs  the waitstaff was amazing as well  i would like to return to the kierand location on a regular basis  but wil probably limit my visits until they receive an espresso machine 
root canal    the word even evokes a shudder of dread  it dredges up a very visceral response so many of us have to childhood fears of pain and scary noises  the dentist office now  as an adult  isnt much more fun  happily  some places are at least more comfortable than others    ive had a lot of dental work done  a whole lot  truth be told  i was pretty worried when i found out i was going to have to go in for my first root canal   but after being in a vicodin haze for over a week  it was time to get this tooth fixed   happily  the folk at copper star dentistry got me in to the office within a day  a conflict in my schedule  not theirs  and had me on the way to pain free within a single visit   i cant recommend this place highly enough   excellent dental care 
the other reviewers arent lying  this place is truly an easily overlooked gem in the phoenix area   its certainly not much to look at on the outside  but as soon as you walk in  you can smell how good the food is going to be   truth be told  the head chef caught me sniffing the air when i arrived  and laughed a little when he saw the big grin split my face   the menu is expansive   there are pizza  sandwiches  calzones  seafood  and various pasta dishes   i had the pasta giovanni  a combination of sausage  chicken  and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce   full and flavorful  as well as perfectly presented  i had a hard time not just devouring the whole thing   my friend had the linguine special with sun dried tomatoes and spinach with olive oil   it was a far more subtle dish  but no less wonderfully composed   the dish was not overly oiled and spinach tasted delightfully fresh  always a plus with spinach  the frozen stuff sucks    as we started to slow a little  the chef came over with a plate of bread pudding for us to try   now  im not a desert person normally  but this was wonderful   far more savory that just sweet  light and fluffy   a perfect final bite to end a wonderful meal   it even turned out our server was one of the owners  and she told us a little bit about the place   throughout  she was very attentive to us and in no way overbearing   overall  this is a fantastic dining experience all around   one of my best so far in phoenix 
they are the best  reaper everything   good quality and good price  very happy to find this place  highly recommend to every one  helena k
excellent food  great view  and service with a smile   we always eat there for breakfast every visit to vegas  this last visit  we ate there three days straight   the pancakes  crepes  are as good as it gets and the chicken sausage is unbelievable   where else can you eat right on the strip  people watch  have a view of the bellagio  eat excellent food  and be pampered by caring  knowledgeable staff 
first time  last time  french fries were soft and way under cooked  pizza was tasteless and meatball hoagie was just strange tasting  after taste is still with me and not in a good way  so disappointed  still looking for a great place  i have learned the hard way  because people go and the place is open doesnt mean its good  save yourself 
just called and they held my aarti party indian cookbook  i stopped going to b n in cranberry  they never have the books im looking for including my cookbook  so settlers ridge it is  longer hours  bigger store and the books i want  its great 
tasty tacos  i like the bbq chicken tacos   the fish tacos  the simple food is always tasty   delicious  i also like the bbq chicken burrito  the chips are good too  the outdoor patio is nice in the fall   right by the light rail   they have a tiny parking lot so park on the street if you can 
i have been here several times over the years and they do an okay clean for the basic  7 99 price  if you are looking for a clean exterior this fits my budget  i am happy with their service and its consistent and good for the money  i think they must have improved from previous years  my car looked better after and that is all i wanted  the staff tries to be fast and efficient 
cute little wine   beer place  we only had drinks here but it was a nice summer friday night   they had a live music band  we liked the drink choices for local brews and wines by the glass  the menu looked good but we only had drinks  there is a shortage of parking because you have to park on the street  cute old house 
ranjit is such an inspiration for his guidance in developing a meditation practice  i spent time at charlotte meditation and feel like the seeds are sown for learning how to breathe in and relax your mind  this practice helps you reconnect with yourself   the time in meditation shows me that our thoughts are not all powerful  they are a choice  how we deal with stress is ranjits guidance and he is very patient  especially in helping you deal with problems  i found the time very productive 
in a word  outstanding   the staff of charlotte pet sitting is professional  thoughtful and wonderful to work with for any pet sitting needs  i have been a client for almost five years and i love knowing that my dog is well cared for and secure with these dog walkers  i have tried different services and this is the best one for my dog   my anxious dog is not the easiest to handle  but the staff handles him with care and is very responsive to any requests  even last minute phone calls  i appreciate having such a great group of people to rely on when i need help 
honey blond ale was good flavor and easy drinking for an ale  i wish the atmosphere was not so loud  honestly felt like you had to shout to be heard inside on a saturday night  seemed like some of the regulars took over a corner so expect to go early and claim seats  ate the food truck food for dinner  it was okay but nothing memorable  outside brewery it resembles an office park but inside more of a warehouse feel 
we enjoyed the fabulous food at blue taj  especially the chicken tikka masala  we shared the vegetables samosa which is delicious and savory  the chicken tikka masala curry is perfectly seasoned and delicious  the garlic naan is savory and hearty  the white wine albarino is awesome  they are super busy so plan on a reservation or waiting for a table  we had a reservation but they were packed so we waited about 10 minutes for our table at the bar   it worked out because we were able to eat outside and it was a perfect fall evening  parking is in the garage nearby and its usually easy to find parking 
great food and excellent service  i would definitely order from here again  we ordered pick up and the person who took our order went above and beyond to ensure we knew where the restaurant is  without us even asking  and was at the door to welcome us when we got there  he made our dinner during our montreal visit feel like home  thank you 
review is specific to the buffet   visited last night   had several items including the mongolian bbq   woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible case of food poisoning   been laying here all day unable to get out of bed for the most part and making trips to the bathroom all day     food was marginal at best for a buffet   tried it because it was close to my house   wont go down that road again 
i had the fortunate opportunity to attend the winter beer fest in january thanks to winning tickets from yelp  this place is a bit out of the way  but i was lucky to have a vehicle since my mother currently lives in las vegas  i love beer and my mother knows that  she too likes to knock em back  so it wasnt difficult convincing her to come check out this event with me  we had several options for seating when we arrived and i noticed the shuffleboard not being played in the side room  so we decided to play a couple matches with our beer tastings  the servers were extremely friendly as well as the bartenders   had the chance to try some joseph james brews which i had never heard of since we dont get their beers in portland  the stout was awesome  my mother hadnt ventured out much in stouts and now she is a fan   we had a blast playing shuffleboard and tasting beers  i think my mom even had more fun then me       for the beer lovers  this is the place to go    thank you again yelp 
very happy to have found this shop  been to other quilting shops in the area  but this one is by far my favorite  great selections  great prices  and very friendly and helpful staff  christmas goose is definitely going to be my go to shop 
i am so happy to have found this place and i will definitely be back   many times   i spotted this place on my way to get my haircut and decided to drop in for lunch   my plan was to grab food to go  but once i took a look at the beautiful decor inside i decided to stay  and im glad that i did   the service was excellent and the food was so flavourful that i almost lost my self respect and licked the plates   i had the vegetable samosas appetizer and the chicken saag with plain rice and garlic naan   the chef  owner was very sincere and welcoming   i thanked him for the wonderful meal and wished him much success for the future    if you are a fan of indian food then you are in for a real treat here 
if i could give this zero stars  i would  the salesman who came out to help us started by arguing with my father about the condition of the wheels on the car we were looking at and whether they were ground down  which clearly they were  when my father backed off and said that he wasnt going to argue with him about this  the salesman just said   have a nice day  and walked back inside  i know exactly where i wont be buying my next car 
service is always great  great decor  clean and the food is delicious  brunch  happy hour  dinner    you just cant go wrong  we do miss the unlimited mimosas on the menu though 
i stopped here with my mom and friend before seeing a show at the state theatre  it was by far the best bar service i have ever had  the bartender as very attentive and knowledgeable  there were lots of choices for beer  i would highly recommend this to anyone and hope to go back soon 
food was terrible  la tacos steak was over flavored and the guacamole is like soup  it tastes terrible too  i wouldnt recommend and wont be returning 
this place is a gem  its clean  the service is great  the food is delicious   our family has been there several times  we had the sopapillas  fry bread  with beans and cheese  its a generous portion and the beans are made from scratch   just like my moms frijoles  the menudo is just tasty  theres equal amounts of hominy and tripe and the broth is delicious  what makes this establishment special  its  family owned and it shows on the quality  of the food  service  and are exceptionally nice people 
pita jungle is definitely one of my fav restaurants   ive been here countless times over the years and it is always a great experience   there truly is not a bad thing on the menu   some of my personal favorites are the hummus trio with chicken  turkey pesto lavosh wrap  and the black bean burger   they def have the best hummus ive ever eaten   everything is very reasonably priced and it is an extremely laid back atmosphere with very fast service   if you go during high times expect to wait  but it is always well worth it   if you want to try a variety of dishes go during their happy hour and try their  1 or  2 tappas   you can order a whole bunch   never had a bad experience here    i would highly recommend it to anyone 
really good  the calamari was the best ive had in a while  bring your own wine though 
we found this place by accident but are very happy we did  everything was excellent from the authentic food  to the drinks  to the service  our waiter was very accommodating  made great suggestions and even brought out an authentic herb for us to try  very reasonably priced as well  has an adorable shaded patio you can dine on  we will definitely be back 
lv has a overwhelming number of outstanding restaurants to choose from  tired from all day at the trade show and not wanting to wait anywhere we decided to eat at our hotel  phils italian steak house was the best offered at ti    the place was only 1  3 full but they still gave us the  do you have a reservation   routine  looked over their reservation book to see if they could  fit us in  once seated we quickly decided on the prix fixe evening special  the starter caesar salad was very good  dressed perfectly it had the lightly salted white anchovies instead of the typical too salty canned ones    my petite filet was excellent  cooked as requested  nothing to complain about with the accompanying steamed asparagus and whipped potatoes  creme brulee dessert was also very good  service was efficient but impersonal  nice but you can do better 
its a nice place to have dinner with group of friends because its very spacious  the owner is very generous  there are two choices of rice   white or bean  also there are two types of water they serve   cold water or hot tea  i would recommend the hot tea  in addition  they serve side dishes and they are pretty good  if you ask for more  they will serve you more  the food is pretty good and enough to fill you up 
if youre looking for something quick and affordable  then jipbap it is   its a type of korean food that is fairly popular in korea  i heard  and the idea of the food is easy   rice on the bottom and your choice of meat  vegetable  and sauce over the rice   in my opinion  the sauce is too much so i always ask the kitchen to put less sauce   the portion is fairly okay but if you got a big appetite  then youll probably need to order two   the staffs are very friendly and nice and will help you explain whats in your food in case youre unsure what the menu is all about   
amazing food and service    good bye ritz and hello camby and artizen   see u very soon
honestly some of the best sushi you can find in toronto thats not tucked away in the small menu of a fancy joint   i live really close to the place and dont think i wouldve found out about it or tried it otherwise  its just not in a very prominent location  and as a result  is never really busy  so of course i was really surprised by the quality of the fish  the menus pretty extensive  with some dishes you dont normally find at most uninspired  teriyaki bento  sushi places in toronto  there are some specials on the walls that change once in a while  and there are some dishes whose fish combinations are  chefs choice    its definitely more expensive than your usual sushi place  but the quality meets the price  the fish is always fresh  and dishes like the chirashi don has a good fish to rice ratio  even their non sushi dishes are pretty good  like their udon soups   its a small place but cozy  and again  with its hidden location ive never had to worry about not being seated  if youre ordering take out there are some magazines and books in english and japanese to keep you entertained   or if youre like me you can eavesdrop on the waitress and sushi chefs bantering in japanese       id come more often given its convenience  but the price of high quality sushi in toronto forces me to make it more of a luxury 
ive always wanted to go here because there arent that many chinese dessert places downtown compared to the selection uptown and in richmond hill  markham area   my friend and i shared one of the mango desserts with sago and it was great  we also got a dish with ice cream  tapioca  popping boba and grass jelly  i like popping boba in my frozen yogurt but it just did not go with the other things in this dish     might just be my taste  although my friend did think the same   overall the dessert selection looked really good and other customers desserts looked quite appetising   the staff here are really casual     almost too casual  when we entered  we couldnt tell who worked here and who didnt  after we ordered our first dessert we wanted the menu again to order more  and after we finally got someones attention  she looked like a deer in headlights and really unsure of what to do   just come over to our table first instead of standing there and then we can tell you what we want from you    im not usually picky about service but it was kinda annoying here  i will probably still come back here to try more of their menu  though 
i took class twice with leena and i wish i could recommend her but i cant  once i took class with her when she taught at a yoga studio in las vegas and another time i took class with her on the strip  i was a dancer with one of the production shows   i did not really enjoy my classes with leena as i felt her classes werent challenging at all  i wasnt looking for an advanced class  just a good stretch  and i didnt feel like i benefitted physically when her class was over  i have taken classes with many other yoga instructors in las vegas and feel that there are far better teachers around 
id recommend getting your reservations early as the place is quite small  i had ricotta herb dumplings in a shiitake mushroom broth  it was amazing  id recommend this place for a date night  and if you want another drink after the robin room down the street is great 
im wavering between 4 starts and 5  the food is simple  rustic and heavy  when you are in the mood for something filling this hits the spot  i really like the chicken dijonnaise  more  for the garlic mashed potatoes than the chicken  in winter they have warm cocktails served in mugs that warm you right up 
the staff is friendly and they treat their customers like family   the prices are great   i couldnt afford a med and they called the doctor to get it switched to something cheaper   i wouldnt go anywhere else  
awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good  fun night   walking in  this can be extremely deceiving  its dark wood and somewhat old school  but it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner  where the real fun comes is when you step out back  they have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back  tons of tvs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months    overall this is a really cool bar  locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown  the area has tons of restaurants but thomas street offers a full menu as well   a must go if you live in charlotte 
i love sushi   i think this is a great modern restaurant in a hip and up and coming area of the city   for starters i stopped by the bar to wait for the rest of my party   i had the cucumber crisp martini and it was so good   the bartender cautioned that it was mostly vodka with some muddled cucumbers and a little simple syrup  so that makes it not too sweet   it was so refreshing and a great start   the bartender was also fabulous and had i not been meeting a big party  i would have dined with him at the bar top     when our party all arrived we were seated and ordered a variety of apps   the calamari and beef tataki were my favorites   the calamari is flash fried with sauce drizzled on the top   it has a touch of spice to it and heat on the back end  which i loved   the beef tataki was seared perfect  but it did have some cajun type spices on the outside which i wasnt crazy over   but the sliced cucumbers on the plate with it were amazing   they were drenched in ponzu sauce and if i had been at home i would have licked that plate   for the main course i chose the christmas roll  topped with shrimp and avacado  and also a few pieces of nigiri   overall the food and service was great   everything is decently priced and in keeping with other sushi restaurants in the city   the atmosphere is great and we went on a sunday  which wasnt too crowded   but during weekend nights i can see it getting quite crowded   overall a great place for food and drinks 
i go here with my mom and sister all the time  great food for vegetarians  i recommend their chili paneer  dry  and veggie manchurian  gravy  as well as their corn soup 
i went on a sunday evening in october with friends before we saw a movie at the tiff after dark festival  i was with 2 guys  one came later than we had planned so we waiting for him to order   i ordered the fried fish  with rice and 2 sauces  and the sweet potato tempura  both came quickly and were extremely delicious   some things i would improve    the initial service  when ordering drinks  they asked us 6 times in 15 min    when we ordered drinks it took them that same about of time to bring it   other than that i liked the atmosphere and the vibe  would def go back 
they installed the floor and it took twice as long as they estimated  i figured it would be worth it because perhaps they were being thorough  since installation one month ago  there have been a couple of issues with the flooring  all of these supposed warranties they offer unfortunately mean nothing when the representatives at best buy dont call or show up when they say they will  at least six phone calls to them and the flooring is still damaged with no sign of it being fixed   we have been planning to replace the rest of the flooring in the house at the end of the year  safe to say we will not be using best buy flooring 
so now that ive been to stacys a few times  thought id review it  all in all  its a great place  seems to me a little on the pricey side but you also get a decent amount of food so its a wash    their bbq items are wonderful and the barbecue sauce is out of this world  i was slightly disappointed on my last visit though  i decided to try the fish and all i can say is it is a barbecue joint   it was a bit over cooked and they were out of tarter sauce which is a huge bummer is youre ordering a fish   chips type deal and they were out  the girl behind the count was more than apologetic and offered me ranch instead  which much to my surprise  was alright  i will still happily continue to go to stacys keeping in mind to order the barbecue stuff  i was told the catfish was outstanding though 
the quality of the fish here is pretty good but you have to be willing to pay a little extra  i would actually rate this place between 3 and 4 stars    i have been here multiple times  consistently the sushi has been good  rolls are good as well  ive ordered their massive party combos for large party  its pretty worth it  it gets pricier to eat here with decreasing   of people in your party    i wish they would charge lunch cheaper or have a special price during their low times  keep regular price for dinner   there are lots of space for seating  they also have private rooms in the back for large parties and also a tatami seating    service level is ok  sometimes really good  sometimes average  overall a chill place to hang out with friends or dinner with family 
terrible  average food   deep fried chicken  fish  etc in a taco  shockingly bad service   asked for the corn to be cut in two but apparently this is too hard for the kitchen  got our order wrong  and musics loud af as well  they even had the audacity to slap a forced 18  gratuity on top of the  380 bill  for 6  as well  far better options around john  dont waste your time 
wow  just wow  came here at about 10 pm  i didnt even go to any stores  the mall walk is just brilliant  there is so much to look at  the fish tank at the end is just incredible and the talking statues is one of the highlights of the mall  you can spend hours in here just wandering around 
i went to this nail salon on the recommendation from previous yelp reviewers  my daughter and i came from out of town  i get pedicures frequently and my feet are always in good shape  they only spent about 15 minutes on us and this was without anyone waiting  the massage was very short  we were disappointed and would not recommend this salon if you want a good quality pedicure where they pay attention to detail 
i was going to go to hollywood suits in california  but luckily stopped by this recently new store that open a month ago  they have an awesome selection of suits  shoes  and shirts  the owner sammy is a genuine guy  he used to have a business here a long time ago  but closed down because of the bad economy back then  im glad hes back  great service and same day alterations  the suit deals include 3 shirts  3 ties  3 socks  and 3 pocket squares for free if you buy 3 suits  you cant beat that  if you roll through  ask for sammy  nice guy 
my brother orders from pie snob for every holiday gathering  i was a little hesitant at first because i can bake a little something myself   i really like the caramel apple and regular apple pie  though i have not been to the location  i am told its very clean  try them out and im sure you will enjoy   they have definitely become a hit with the fam 
as a college student i spent my summers working as a press operator for gm  im truly loyal to gm cars  the experience from the receptionist to bobby the salesman who sold me my beautiful car was great    the finance department was quick with minor wait times  my whole experience was great  alex showed me how to work all of the digital que in the car  gage told me to feel free to come back with any questions  i love my car and i couldnt wait to show it off to the world     tina
very nice establishment  spacious and no waiting   will be returning  all the ladies are lovely 
when you have 90 110 minutes for dinner     saturday evening  we were advised by hostess that she could seat us but it would be about 10 20 minutes before we could place an order  we placed a drink order that took about 20 minutes to arrive  dinners followed about 45 minutes later  about 80 90 minutes for two adult  and one childs dinners for to arrive   my chicken tortellini was good  adequate portion for the  14 50    my wifes  14 chicken phg  named after the restaurant  was maybe a single 4oz seasoned chicken breast and a minimum any accompanying else of with a small side of spaghetti  soup or salad was also included   had it not been for the  12 off  enjoy  entertainment  punch card  it would have been a 2 star review   theyve been open about a year  i counted maybe 3 servers  many empty seats  the hostess warning that the kitchen was backed up was absolutely true    hostess was friendly  empathetic  waitress was visited table to take order  deliver another drink  and serve dinner then the check    they have issues  some potential  but some real logistical issues  ill try again in 6mos or so to see if its improved 
michael minas pub 1842 is an amazing pub restaurant  the peanut butter crunch burger is amazing    the bacon jam mixed with potato chips on the burger is just heavenly  i would highly recommend those whose are staying at the mgm hotel   casino to stop by for a bite to eat  the lobster corn dogs are also equally tasteful and delicious  this is one of my favorite restaurants located in the mgm  i have been a regular several times now when staying at mgm 
had a great lunch there     the mussels by far were the best ever  service was great    a bit noisy even at lunch but ill take it 
get rick    the man knows hair  hes been cutting hair for over 30 years   i went in this morning and needed a trim but wanted to keep my length  he told me no problem and went to it  it is been some time since my hair has looked this nice  the man has a wonderful personality  and a very loud voice  i have incredibly sensitive ears and it kind of hurt with his volume  but the haircut is well worth it 
we waited 20 minutes and finally got our waters  then waited another 20 and our server never came back to take our order  they were all standing around talking so we threw a 10 on the table and walked out and went to hayashi  we were seated and served right away  dont waste your time at tomo
shyeet man  id give this 0 stars for cookies   my mom  bless her loving soul  surprised me and had 2 boxes delivered to me on my bday  chocolate fudge and chocolate chip  yup she knows me best  chocolateislyfe  im a 22 yo uiuc student   numberonepartyschool2k15  hosting a bday party  id like to think im a kind and sharing person  i left both boxes open near all of the alcohol  now heres the disturbing part  the chocolate fudge cookie box is full and the chocolate chip box still has 5 cookies left     how    i thought to myself  these cookies were sooo     subpar  taking a bite of what looked like delicious soft chewy cookies resulted in bland disappointment  they were so sad that even drunk college kids didnt want them  10  10 sadness would not buy again   cvs has cheaper and tastier cookies available    the 2 stars  1  for presentation  good job  happy eyes  wow  2  the delivery girl was a qt3 14 and super nice on the phone 
my favorite happy hour spot  great food  exceptional service and wednesday you can get a pizza and a bottle of wine for  20  and the pizza is fantastic  if you havent been to stella  give it a try 
much improved experience  great food  incredible service from brittany  a lovely evening  much better than our last brunch experience 
the food is great and you cant beat the price   the service was out of this world   if you are looking for medeteranian food this is the place to go   dont bother with the big box stores its not the same as a restaurant in the back of a grocery store 
this place was okay  most of the reviews rave about the korean chicken and as a first timer thats also what one of the employees recommended  i mean korean chicken at a hawaiian restaurant  i guess  it literally tasted like my moms  vietnamese  chicken but sweeter  which of course isnt bad but i was really expecting something amazing  especially with all of the reviews  the portions are very generous  however  you will have to share or have lots of leftovers    which is always nice   i wish this place had katsu but it doesnt  their spam masubi was meh  seaweed was too hard to bite through  also their mac salad  mac salad  super generous portions but super bland  youre just eating mayo  
have been big fan since the opening and eat here 2x per week  but  if you are going to serve salads one way in the store and another when placing to go orders the customer should be told  flat grilled chicken is different than a chicken breast   tossed if different than not tossed  large pieces of vegetables are different than cut up small  aja chopped salad   just saying it should be consistent
great food  great drinks  not usually prepared to handle any sort of crowd early in the week so youll wait fooorrreeevvveerrrrr for food and refills    but the servers and bartenders are really nice so it makes up for it   and dont have to go to the bathroom ever  the smell is nauseating in the basement  even with the stinky bathroom is gets 4 stars  i recommend everything  never been disappointed with an order  especially the pulled pork sliders 
i like pizza  correction  i love it  it is my favorite food group  if i could eat it for every meal and not blow up to the size of the stay puft marshmallow man  i would    deweys does an amazing job  at pretty much at everything  i kind of want to live there  we got two salads  the house salad and the peppercorn ranch  only order the large if thats all you are going to eat for a week or if you are sharing with three other people  what im saying they are huge  both were dressed perfectly and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious    then the pizza  it was so good  we split one large into two specialties  also a great feature of deweys  we got the ryans inferno and the edgar allen poe  four thumbs way up  the toppings are interesting  not your basic pep  mush  which i know they have  but why bother  i can make that at home  the huge whole pieces of roasted garlic was the highlight  and please reheat this the next day in the oven  it doesnt deserve the microwave  thats just mean   the only negative was the wait  we went at about 6 30 on a friday night and it was jammed and a 45 minute wait  so we put our name down and went next door for a cocktail  came back and had another cocktail  great beer and wine selection  and watched the performance through the window of young eye candy tossing dough and entertaining the kids until our table was ready  we were told that if you come between 6p and 7 30p its just going to be crazy like that  but will clear out after that  so plan accordingly  and enjoy 
i love this place  the service was great  the food was great and the wine was great  its great  i think the bartenders name was christopher and my group of girls were all in love  i cant wait to go back and enjoy the patio  its a little out of the way for me  so i often forget its even an option  i need to work on my memory 
the watershed is located in a pretty nice area and sits right on the side of a lake with great views  the inside is wide open with high ceilings  a bar and a pool table  everything seemed to be fairly clean and our waitress was friendly enough  there were a couple things i found off putting though  i went for breakfast on a sunday with several people right as they were opening    1   when we were seated we were given dinner menus and then no one came back to the table for 15min  once someone did finally come back around we asked for the appropriate menu only to be given the dinner menu again  we were eventually able to get the right menus though   2   there are no condiments on the tables  not a big deal in itself but when you only see your server once every 30min you realize how nice it is to have salt  sugar for your coffee  etc  also note we were one of 2 tables in the entire restaurant   3   i actually made note more of when we placed our order and it took 1 hour for the food to come out  most of the order was just eggs     4   multiple orders were wrong  some of the group i went with asked for things like no cheese or no onions but none of that happened   5   pricey  my order consisted of 2 eggs  1 tortilla  a handful of diced potatoes and 2 strips of thin bacon   11 easy   6   the server never returned      those were the main problems and as far as the food    just okay  watershed has a lot of potential that they are doing nothing with  i dont see myself returning here again 
when i found the walnut on highland building would be open this summer  in time for me to move  i couldnt believe my luck  id been living in an old house a quarter mile away in shadyside and always dreamed about what a great location that place under construction would be  and when i found out it was not only pet friendly      but also affordable  i knew i didnt need to look anywhere else    moving in  i was not disappointed  the apartment is spacious and well appointed with appliances  i particularly love the open kitchen  the building utilities are great as well   washer and dryer can be paid with a credit card and the gym is full of high tech equipment   this is my first time living in a managed apartment and walnut capital has been great  all my requests are handled quickly  the common areas are kept clean  staff is always friendly  and they even throw parties for the residents   finally  the location is amazing  access to great bars and restaurants within stumbling distance  bus lines right out side to downtown  close to the main roads  but yet still fairly quiet for city living    i highly recommend this building 
ive never been so disappointed  we ordered two chicken burritos  got home and found that there was a breakfast burrito and some mystery meat and onion burrito  we ate some of each  then brought them back for a credit or refund  no one spoke good enough english and they wouldnt do anything  needless to say  they lost a customer who used to go there 3 4 times a month 
i just took my doggie the second time for grooming and it was another great job  i have a 90lbs husky chow mix so he has a lot of fur to clean  thanks for a great job 
i loved it here  everything inside is so modern and flashy  enjoyed the balcony and the view  room is clean and the bathroom was beautiful  worth every penny 
we just came back from this place tonight  we really enjoyed our dinner at this tiny ethiopian restaurant  the food was full of flavour  they offered extra injera for no extra charge  we had the veggie combo and a lamb dish which turned out to be a little too much food for us  we are stuffed right now  and the cost   31 including tax  it was really reasonable for the huge portion we got    the 2 staff were so nice  food came out fast and we were impressed with the quality of it  we will be back   disclaimers and other notes  decor is basic  but it seems like they have outdoor seating  we would have taken it  but its too cold tonight  they did not really have dessert options and there is no alcohol  so you may want to opt to plan drinks  sweets into your evening outside the main meal  this is not food that poeple eat with utensils  a lady near our table suggested many times to the owner that they must get forks  and when he tried to explain his cultural tradition  she was all  ya  but you really need forks  it was kind of hilarious    enjoy 
i think this is a cute little place  we got pizza and a dessert to share and both were decent  the service was good and the price is fine considering that its in yorkville  i cant say that the food is particularly special but the pizza tasted very fresh  as in the vegetable toppings   the dessert was somewhat disappointing because it didnt look awesome nor did it taste amazing  however  i would come back for their pizza again and maybe a different dessert 
im a huge fan of joe fresh so naturally  i loved this store  is it more amazing than the joe fresh inside a superstore  not really  as a matter of fact  i find that you can find more items on sale inside the superstore than a free standing joe fresh store  i would like to see them start selling their cosmetics and accessories at these free standing stores   i cant wait for the joe fresh on queen st w to open because that location would be the most accessible for me 
i just checked into this hotel 2 nights ago   i am a loyal costumer of the sls in los angeles  and i am very disappointed to be here at the vegas sls   the staff at checkin are a little deceiving  they pretend you got the room u wanted  but in fact its not  i had to wait for over an hour to get my room key  after changing rooms   the rooms are so poorly designed  it is a  new hotel  but it seems very old  the elevator buttons dont function  the ac in my room was worse than an ac in a motel room  it has peculiar smell  cleaning is terrible  i always make a note in hotels to make sure it is cleaned  based on my note the cleaning was terrible   i had tissue papers under my bed sheath   had to wait over an hour for a tooth brush   i will never go back to this hotel and i absolutely do not recommend anyone to go here   i think they opened a year early  this place needs a lot more work to be functional   i go to vegas for business once a month  at the minimum  i have been to all the hotels  almost  i will never go back to the sls motel 
this place is great  the food is really good and spicy if you want  the drive up is really helpful as well  i do wish they gave more rice than one bowl but thats not too big of a deal 
someone that lives in mississauga had recommended the place based on their experience near them  glad to have listened  very friendly service   well priced   delicious food  we had a couple of the different burgers  short rib tacos  tuna sliders and swordfish tacos   we all thought it was great  we ended it with the cookies and ice cream   just amazing soft cookies  we will definitely go back 
worst valentines day ever  thanks to this stupid hotel  its old creepy owner and its staff  i just dont have the words to describe how bad our experience was here  i really have no idea how this place is still in business  the place is old and dark  it definitely could use some renovations   painting  flooring   cleaning and most important  some customer service  i just dont know how people can pay so much for a place thats not worth it  where their all inclusive became a  sorry thats not included  where you are paying for the room and when you ask for your change they make you sign a receipt for your own change  how stupid can that be   and beware if you want to call and ask for water because they will deny it to you  i mean what hotel in the whole world does that  specially here in canada   where water is free   and to top the whole experience  their  luxurious pool  faded our swimming suits paint away and theyre ruined  do you think they would pay for them      so guys  spread the word   if you have the money to spend in a luxury hotel  go to a real one  save yourselves and whomever comes with you such a disgusting time coming to this crappy hotel 
the quality of customer service here varies and ive never had someone sound happy to take my order  several times i have gone inside and my order is not called out and they leave it at the counter along with other people orders as if we are all going to automatically know who its supposed to belong to  i once ordered a drink and sat down and talked to my my friend and we were unaware that our drink came out bc they didnt call it out  i only come to this starbucks because its close to home but lately ive been thinking about just driving out to a different district and ordering where they have higher standards for their employees  ive been to this starbucks way too many times to give them another chance    for some who are confused  this is not the starbucks inside of safeway  this location on yelp shows the drive thru starbucks
i have visited this clinic maybe 4 times  i called a few days ahead of my appointment to reschedule  appalled at my experience with susan     when i could not pin down an appointment time fast enough for her she stated she was  having fun playing this game  after the appointment was made  she ended the call  goodluck to you   a strange  rude and poor experience  gave 2 stars as all other staff were quite pleasant 
horrible business ethics on technicians   had made an appointment for my two bedrooms and two area rugs to get cleaned   went over the details over phone my their call center receptionist  she stated that their was a special of  99 00 for two rooms and that it was perfect for my needs and that the other carpets where to be  42 00 extra  i also mentioned that i live on the second floor on my condo and it has an elivator  she said that it wasnt a problem and they would be at my home between 3 6pm   day off my appointment i get a call at 3 40pm stating a  crew  was enroute  upon arrival i greeted the young men and wasnt given a business card nor did they wear shoe covers or take their shoes off  they then randomly split up into different rooms and met up together with wisepering and more wispering red flag   to say the least i wasnt comfortable with them after that  one guy then makes a statement that its going to cost  75 00 before they even start anything due to they would have to use a portable carpet cleaner and its a second floor condo unit  and im looking minimum at  269 00 with all the extras  red flag   at this point i told them that price is not what was agreed on and they both started talking sideways on their receptionist stating she has no idea what she is talking about and that she is new and knows nothing about nothing  wow   talk about disappointed in a company that is one  represented so poorly by untrained young men  two  have abrasive techniques on sales and service along with their soft skills  three   have such lack of respect of a fellow employee  little to say i asked them to leave and have a manager call me  also  note that they didnt attempt to leave me a qoute or any numbers to do what they where presenting  proposing to me   last red flag   conclusion  ive been in the technical service industry for 15 years and i see these type  guys come around more than id like to admitt  stay far away from this company  and further hope you can find a more local company that cares what product they send to your home 
horrible horrible shipping service  ordered three textbooks from amazon  free shipping for two of them and one required the normal shipping price  was expecting to have them shipped through fedex or ups  and was surprised to see ontrac  which i had never heard of   i begin school out of town next week and the textbooks were pricey  and i still have not received them   ontrac tracking says that it was delivered this afternoon to my front door     weird because there is nothing on my porch and i never heard a knock or the doorbell  none of my neighbors have received it either   i emailed their customer service and received a relatively quick reply  however she just explained that my issue would be sent to the more local ontrac representative and they would get back to me  i just want my textbooks  who knows where they are 
what a treat   got a facial and pedicure as a gift from my husband thru a travelzoo voucher and it was one of the best experiences of my life   yujin is a fantastic aesthetician   when you go to a spa  often times you get 1 person to do 1 service and another person to do the other services   i had yujin for both and cant recommend her enough    now that the secret is out  i may never get another appointment    my facial was perfection    extractions and cleansing and tightening all happened without any skin irritation or redness   the pedicure was impeccable   she even reprimanded me for going to a typical nail salon and getting my heels razored off  i know its a no no  but it really does make my heels smooth for the first little while    i appreciated her concern for the long term health of my feet   and the spa in itself is just beautiful   dark wood and yet inviting and the tea in the waiting room    delicious   really  it is 2 thumbs up  way up 
seriously enjoyed a nice meal at this very cozy and romantic little house on the corner of davenport   its not cheap  thats for sure   for my husband and myself  a bottle of wine  2 appetizers  2 entrees  2 desserts cost us nearly  200   too bad we werent there during winterlicious to get more bang for our buck  but having said that  im still glad we went on an october evening for a date night   i had the lobster bisque   it was a little watery  not as creamy or thick as i had imagined it would be  like a clam chowder or other bisques ive had  but it was still flavorful   i ordered the seared scallops for my entree and it was delicious   nicely charred scallops that were accompanied by their sausage risotto   for dessert  i ordered the milk chocolate cheesecake wrapped in phyllo dough   that was rich and delicious   highly recommend something as unusual as that for dessert   we had fine service and a good time   2 thumbs up 
this place is amazing  the hot sandwiches and breakfast are delicious     the chocolate chip cookies are so yummy  i am taking some back to ca for my girls   this is not fine dining  you order direct at register where you are handed a buzzer   you pay before you pick up  when your food is ready your buzzer will go off  pick up is from counter where you pay    linda mentioned subway below    umm noooo    this is way better    they also have soups and salads which i didnt get a chance to try  pricing is super reasonable 
good food  but ladies do not work well under pressure  the only friendly and polite worker there was the guy who was bringing out drinks and bussing tables 
i had initially wanted to consign items here and had nothing but poor service and continued trouble with staff in addition to be very poor in communicating with me  i would not consign anything or buy anything here  i consign many unneeded items and have never had such poor customer service from staff and management  they are very unwilling to go extra mile for customers in addition to being rude  i am completely disappointed in my decision to choose this store  i will be consigning elsewhere and suggest others do as well   i agree with a previous reviewer staff is cold and there is junk all over store and way overpriced  agreed  mis managed  
we have tried several clinics for our maltese  there were always things we didnt like  not any more  we found dr rachel through another vet clinic  quotes for cleaning chesters teeth were astronomical  the non anesthetic method did not work at all  that was a complete rip off  a lady working at another vet referred us to scottsdale animal healthcare because she use to work there and knew they were reasonable  it was  and a complete blood test was included  dr rachel is so thorough and knowledgeable  she has given us lots of great advice and we just love the clinic  they are open on sundays  which is convenient for many people 
the food is great  we love the chips and quesadillas  i had a salmon salad that was really good  ive not had anything that wasnt tasty    the location is great  midtown clt is a fun and growing community next to the river and the greenway  there are condos and apartments popping up everywhere  and there are great places to eat  parking is nightmarish on this end of midtown  though  the trader joes garage is a real disaster of civil engineering  the reason for the low score is that the service has always been terrible  weve put up with it because we liked the food but it is consistently bad  one of the reasons you decide to eat at a mexican restaurant is for the chips and salsa you get from the beginning  today  they kept telling us for an hour that they were  waiting on the chips  to be made  it seemed like joke  like we all knew there were no chips  w e never got our chips 
dave has saved my jeeps life on multiple occasions  always gets me in right away and is friendly honest and helpful 
having just been in italy  we were afraid to try the new italian restaurant and pizzeria in the neighborhood  boy are we glad we did  this place is intimate and the staff is excellent  the bruschetta and pizza were to die for  and the gelato was amazing  we will be back  often 
ive ordered bbq sauce from mcb many times in the past  they used to have great service   not anymore   now  they have young management that puts themselves before the great business it once was    when a boy calls you  maam   i e    john   over the phone and hangs up on you  after youve given him every opportunity to act like a business man and send your dang bbq sauce you ordered over a month ago  women like me crawl through the phone     even their web certificate is expired  so its not safe to input your credit card info through their site      dont bother 
this establishment must have undergone major renovations within the last three to four months  if you go to their website  modern room pics are a true representation of the room we had and the hotel was reasonably priced and chill   the section 8 motel nearby is nowhere near the same level  although it purports to be   i truly enjoyed my stay at siegel  it was clean and comfy 
sushi is good  fast service  never a long wait  close to my house  i come here pretty often  im kinda plain when it comes to sushi  cali roll philly roll spicy crab and shrimp tempura us my favorite 
love this place   will definitely be back   the place was packed    i could see why  great food  atmosphere    friendly service   the only down side is that my side of rice was pretty plain  but the rest was fantastic   sometimes the service was a little slow  but again  they were packed     the floors were very slippery  they should really do something about that    i wore heels   had to walk very carefully so i wouldnt slip 
good food but a bit pricey for the quality  i cant understand why happy hour is limited to the bar only  its very difficult to engage in conversation at the bar when you are with more than one person   too bad as i know of several groups that go elsewhere because of that    my group included 
probably the worst service ive experienced in a very long while    20 minuets   for a cafe    took forever to be served  after asking 3 people to assist   manager came over after and promised the food would be out shortly   took even longer to finally be served   avoid if youre hungry or have even the smallest time issue 
fantastico     the absolute best pastrami in the valley     really     better than any     great subs  husband had the italian  son had the  george  it was fab    the flavors    the meat    the breads    the lettuce    the dressing     everything was fresh and fab    i had the pastrami     new york style  wow      mom had the greek salad which was great  shared some cannolis etc  and the napolean piece  sweetness was perfect  did not feel sooo rich that we were bloated  just the perfect flavor and perfect amount of richness  love the atmosphere     loved the store 
or no stars  what business closes before the time they say they close  i drove down here for nothing 
im giving this place two stars because the prices of the meals were way to over priced  especially for okay food  i got huevos rancheros and    never again    hahaah  i will say that the server was very nice though  i got the melon margarita which was delicious  and he let me try the banana margarita too  soooo i might go back to try the different flavored margaritas which are pricy too  but thats about it 
not sure why  but i was expecting this place to be really good  i was disappointed right away  we ordered chocolate milk  which tasted horrible  maybe rotten  we asked for different drinks  which i asked for sweet tea and got a green sweet tea    which is actually very good  so im not mad about that  the guy was very nice  they served the food on paper plates flimsy paper plates and plastic utensils  wasnt a fan of that 
a couple months ago i purchased a groupon for a four hour cleaning  to be honest i really did like the lady that came  but i dont feel like she did a very good job and she was slow  she was really nice and friendly though  so they had automatically scheduled me for a biweekly cleaning  i didnt want that so i canceled them and as i was canceling the last one the pop up was saying something like  nooo dont go  well give you 50  off  so i thought why not and went ahead to schedule an appointment  with someone else   so i got an email less than 24 hours then my appointment and in my email it says i booked two people  so it charged me for a full price cleaning with my previous lady and the discounted with somebody new  then i go to cancel the one i didnt book and it charged me  15 because it was less than 24 hours  so anyways  that made me angry  and theres no phone number to call  the refunded my money  but i will no longer be using their services 
trent did a great job   he was professional and our durango looked great when he was finished fixing our dent   i would highly recommend him 
i  soooo strongly  do not recommend this restaurant  after three attempts to get two sandwiches i was finally able to get the wrong order again  when calling the restaurant to get the right order through  i was met with a very professional  very well trained scoffing and laughing hostess  i wasnt aware that cooking burgers  or at least getting an order down over the phone was something us plebeians would not understand  horrible customer service  horrible kitchen staff  this place was once a great part of this neighborhood  but not anymore 
i bought a new bike online that needed to be assembled by a professional mechanic  i did not want to want to lug it to a bike shop so i searched for a mobile shop  luckily there is one here called las vegas mobile bike repair  i cannot stress enough that this is the way to go for your bike needs   nate was very professional and accommodating not to mention his overall friendly nature  he explained to me what he was doing without me prompting him for information  i cant think of too many professionals willing to do that  the assembly was done in less than an hour without any tweaking needing to be done after the test ride  very efficient  one last comment was that the price was very reasonable  no buyers remorse here 
so caleb is probably the greatest yoga instructor that ever existed    as a newbie who isnt in the best shape he made me feel totally comfortable and it was a great workout  i would totally recommend him to anyone  advanced  newbie whether in shape or totally out of shape  hes your man 
ordered delivery  staff are courteous and the order came fast  i was delighted by the quality of the food  very fresh and authentic 
we have gone 3 times  my husband likes fish tacos i ordered a beef and cheese burrito   twice the burger was burned so bad i thought someone was playing a joke  the tortilla was dry and breaking apart   the home made salsa is good 
love this place  i have done dinner and brunch and every thing has been spot on  staff is friendly  only downside is it is a bit small  so seating can be difficult at times  i am becoming a regular  keep up the great work 
great place for lunch if you want something quick and easy  all american food and speedy service  i love the jumbo burger and fries 
we rented a cabana in tower three and were immediately greeted by christina who introduced herself and let us know she would be serving us at our cabana for the day  she was pleasant  professional  and extremely accommodating  she helped make our time at the cabana experience exactly what it should be   relaxing  christina came by our cabana and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our time there  the signature should be proud to have her on staff  my guests were very impressed with her as well  thank you christina 
some friends and i tried skinny petes out today   we tried the muffulleta  the cuban  and the evil mr pork chop   all three were really good  but the muffulleta and the cuban stood out the most   the bread always makes or breaks a sandwich for me  and the ciabatta on the muffulleta was great     we all had the pasta salad as a side  and all of us liked it   overall  a nice edition to the neighborhood 
service was stellar  food was excellent  atmosphere was killer   all in all this was a great experience   it got even better when our bill was actually less than we had budgeted 
everyone keeps complaining about the piercer  nick  but technically he is doing his job  he just did my second ear piercing and he did great  he moved the placement by my request and he gave me a helpful opinion  his girlfriend was there but thats how it is  i didnt really care  she didnt really say anything until i said something to her which makes sense since shes just chilling there  it was 9 oclock at night so it wasnt too busy  only as much as you would expect a vegas tattoo shop to be  im glad i went there  better than going to claires like we all did at 7 years old     long story short  its very clean  the staff works with you  and youre in and out as quick as you can be 
stumbled upon this place  while in downtown phoenix turned it out it was their soft opening  its just so happened to be the weekend of the national championship  great weekend to open  i asked for an old fashion and then bald headed bearded man didnt even have a muddler but he still made it happen  best of luck it looks like this place will be a good hangout with friends
been seeing dionna for years and not sure why i havent posted a review till now  anyhow  its very hard to find a stylist that truly knows scissor over comb and doesnt rely on clippers  she is an artist that truly knows how to cut and style hair just using a pair of shears and a comb  this is coming from someone has asian centric hair and its hard to find someone who knows how to manage different textured hair  i like the fact that she utilizes the skill and technique of major recognized salons and she and her group are always going through continued education classes  the salon itself has a clean urban  modern industrial feel  they provide scalp massages  sometimes wine water beverages  and never let you walk out with hair trimmings everywhere   very comfortable professional environment    in my past life i had been exposed to years in hair and fashion environment and my experience with dionna and her crew are very industry educated  reasonable  and reliable 
as far as basic fried fish and chips goes knock need has it down  yes  its a total dive hole in the wall and if you dont like the ambience get it to go   better than other local city chains   they batter their own fish and if someone asked me where to go for good fried fish in the phoenix area it would be knock kneed  where they get the lobster part in their name i have no idea 
their automated carwash rail rammed my car into the one in front me when it reached the end of the line  and they refused to accept responsibility for the damages  as instructed  my car was in neutral  and i was not controlling it in any way  when the other gentleman and i went to speak to the manager  he immediately denied any accountability and showed absolutely no concern for either of us  when i called back later trying to explain the situation in hopes of getting the issue resolved  the woman on the line did nothing but make condescending remarks and offer me the corporate phone number    i am truly baffled by how a business can be so irresponsible and care so little about its customers  and on top of everything  my car was still dirty   edit in response to comment  no  my car was not in drive  and your security camera footage should show that  the issue is that you apparently have no safety controls to prevent cars from colliding in the event that a car in front pauses before exiting the facility  looking through other reviews  i see this isnt the first time youve damaged peoples cars and refused to accept responsibility  in fact  i see that multiple people have had the same exact problem  i dont think we all forgot to put our cars in neutral  its less expensive to blame the customer though  isnt it 
we were traveling from the bay area to az staying in henderson along the way   great greek was recommended by yelp and we were very happy with it   some of  the best greek food ive had anywhere  including east and west coasts  and  as is usually the case  at a very good price   various nice touches in well know dishes   excellent pastry  filo  on the spanakopita that was a part of my mezze plate   kebab chicken  is the yellow from tumeric   was particularly moist and tasty   the wife  very discriminating  and son were pleased as well 
wanted to try this place as the availability of hot pot in town is very scarce  the menu is easy to follow and has good variety  the waitress was extremely helpful clarifying any doubts on the menu  the hot pot was decent considering this small town but the serving sizes where small and expensive  at around 30 dollars a person better food could be eaten elsewhere 
we just returned last night for our third meal here  needless to say  its quite good   we were hungry when we arrived last night and selected our dishes from the small menu  we placed our order and asked to speak to the sommelier for wine suggestions  we selected our wine  and as she went off to get our bottle  our starters arrived  i dont know if it was because we were eating so late  10 pm   but the timing of the meal was a bit off to start    the wine arrived in short order and we tucked in to our first course  the lobster with crispy chicken skin  and the beef tartare  the lobster was delicious   perfectly cooked  plump bites  topped with a sprinkling of crispy chicken skin and a sabayon  there was some cumin in there somewhere  which was surprising and not altogether welcome  but overall the dish was very good  the beef tartare  im afraid  was grisly  the flavours were okay  but the texture was not  after the first course  we asked that they slow down the pace of the meal  and they happily complied  the service is good here  attentive and efficient    next  we received the main courses  scallops with french beans and wild mushrooms in a buttery lobster bisque with curry  indian spices again  but it worked better here   the scallops were sweet and tender  excellent  my companion had the veal sweetbreads  which he loves and orders whenever they are on the menu  anywhere  they came in a tasty yuzu sauce  he likes his sweetbreads to be really crisp  and there were portions that he didnt eat  but overall  he enjoyed the dish           one thing that is always perfect at les 400 coups  the desserts  do not  under any circumstances  skip dessert here   it is wonderful  we had  the green    yogurt  apple  pistachio  olive oil    you get the picture  totally interesting  fresh and delicious  we also had the vanilla cardamom mousse   also good  but if its your first time  get the chocolate pot de creme   its awesome     all in all  a good meal  i would have given another half star if yelp allowed it 
my fav ramen joint in montreal recently took a nosedive quality wise  so ive been eager to branch out and find a replacement  i think that this place could be it  really interesting flavour combos  tasty and varied broths and ingredients  friendly service   what more do you need    the broth is not as thick and cloying here as it is at yokato yokabai  so the soup is a lot lighter while still managing to be hearty and filling    my only feedback is that the menu is a tad confusing to navigate  it features a chart   but i fully intend to familiarize myself with it on return trips  the rice bowls also look awesome  and they have many vegan food options if that is your jam  the space is light and airy  with a large shared table in the center of the room  ill definitely be back to try other dishes 
awesome service and very kid friendly   charlie and joe were amazing helping me find what i needed while shopping with my 3 kids   i would highly recommend living spaces   great service  good prices and impeccable service 
found this hidden gem  had idly and dosa  loved the homestyle cooking taste  very courteous and welcoming owner  offered a yummy laddoo too  you will feel at home  update   returned for evening dinner  had shahi paneer with chapati  rice   raita  everything was so delicious and the homemade taste  i also had gulab jamun  super delicious  soft warm  just as you would make it at home    taste of las vegas is now the only indian restaurant in usa where in the last 20 years i have eaten twice in a single day   will come back again before my business trip is over
i hired modern west for surprise party last week  they were prompt  professional   knowledgeable and delivered excellent service  their interactive photo booth elevated the fun level of our party immensely  i highly recommend modern west   great fun great people great value 
average ambience  slow service but great food  the pho is one of the best in the valley  everything is fresh and delicious  if they could just step up their service and brighten the place up a bit it would make a world of difference  if youre just all about the food this is your place  if you want nice ambience and service you may want to skip this place 
i came here due to a free 2 night stay i received from a contest  it stayed in a executive suite with one 1 king bed  it also came with a balcony but the view wasnt that great  it has lots of room that included a kitchen and a whirlpool  everyone there was extremely nice  even though it was located a bit off the strip the walk towards da the strip wasnt bad just little less than 10mins  a 7  11 was right around the corner for a quick snack  i probable wouldnt want to pay a night there the next time i go to vegas but it was a nice experience  the hotel is strictly no smoking a major plus  ohh and do not buy those little cupcake bath thing they advertise  it sucks 
who doesnt like frozen yogurt   has all the flavors you might want and it is pretty spacious  with tables and couches with foot stools and outdoor seating  make your own yogurt out of one flavor or combine several  add toppings and pay by weight  the yogurts not yours  plenty of parking out front   can you tell im from la    theres usually a line  but it moves fast  i definitely recommend anyone who loves yogurt  or has taste buds  to stop by 
ive been to this yoga studio several times and im quite satisfied with the surface  its not the most fancy yoga studio out there but it does what it promises to do thats for sure  theres a variety of classes to choose from as well as some really great instructors    its a bit on the expensive side however  i know yoga is a growing trend and everything but id expect a space like this to offer competitive prices at the very least  also more classes on the weekends would help as well    the late class schedules are a definite plus for sure  i no longer have to worry about missing a class during the day because theres always one later on  thats a great feature  i use the app on my android tablet to keep up with the class schedules which is convenient  the classes are usually quite busy as well but i find it encourages you to do better and learn from people around you  also the customers ive experienced that frequent the studio are non judgemental and the space seems very casual  unlike some other studios ive been too with die hard yogies that get annoyed when you slip on your mat and disrupt their personal space    all in all  this studio is pretty great for what it is and id recommend it to everyone in the area  especially beginners 
im addicted to gravy so i always get the loco moco  its basically a burger patty   2eggs of your choice on top of the rice drenched with gravy   also have to try the lumpia shanghai  service is fast eventho everytime we come here theres a line     
this place was an accidental great find  we werent sure what we wanted to eat  came across this place and it ended up being a hit  we ordered the mushroom  added bacon  and the kimchi  added chorizo  and they were delicious  we even recommended friends to try this place as well  definitely returning when we are in toronto again 
the reuben was flavourful but on the salty side for sure  i tried the mac and cheese and tbh i can make better vegan mac  not sure if i would go back 
jessica is a true hair artist  shes passionate about what she does and i could tell i was going to like the cut even before she was done  which is not normal for me  she was willing to share tips for styling and also addressed my concerns that i expressed at the beginning about the condition of my hair and how to keep it smooth and less frizzy  shes quite delightful all the way around  i think i found my new hair stylist for life 
oh yes please    its just like the noda amelies but bigger  way more space   best tip is they have beer   wine for happy hour at the uptown location  
went here for brunch  pretty good place   the food was good and the service was attentive   best tip about this place  they have a bloody mary   mimiosa bar you just walk up and tell them you want one  its  5 total   
always a fun time    best tip  go during the day or early as possible  the later you attend the more amount of people and the more crowded and crammed it gets 
amazing    never been here before  but our waitress  sheraton  was wonderful  she was able to explain how all of the ingredients were local and where they came from  very well informed and very friendly  the food was delicious   took a little longer than you would expect at a regular restaurant  but this company is not about fast food   its truly about the quality and how everything is prepared  if youre in a rush this is not the place to choose  but a relaxing weekend brunch   this place hits the spot    best tip about this place  the coffee is served in bowls   just the size i like       plus  they are on the up   up with technology too   paid the bill on an ipad right at my table 
omg   all around superb    i had never heard of this place before  but had received a coupon for a free appetizer and went for brunch  the service was excellent  our waitress anna g was on top of everything  she brought our drinks right at noon  sunday   continuously checked on us and made us feel very comfortable  the manager stopped over a few times too to see how everything was going and was pleasantly friendly    the food was delicious and came out pipping hot  the app we got was the zucchini and eggplant chips   so scrumptious   the poached eggs were cooked to perfection and the drinks were splendid   best tip about this place  large portions   for everything  even the sides that come with the entrees are huge portions 
the mighty meaty is packed  but i love the philosophers pie with steak  olives   fetta cheese  good service and clean 
the building looks a little strange when you first walk in  but what an experience  david was a great teacher and taught my husband and i how to make a paperweight and a vessel  i made a bowl and my husband made a cup   it was an amazing 2 hours  were going back in a few days to pick up our glass  although  we were told that they would ship it to us  not sure how much shipping would cost   its pretty warm in there  but wear a long sleeve cotton shirt  itll keep the heat off your arms    dont mind the rooster that walks around    
youll be surprised by how tasty the food is here  my mom actually suggested this restaurant for me to try  we went there for an afternoon snack  we shared a ham and egg sandwich and escargot  with complimentary garlic bread   the escargot was surprisingly very good  both meals came with complimentary tea 
very hit or miss     im giving 3 stars because i either get excellent service or horrible service      the food is decent bar fare  just a little pricey    fun place to hang out  watch sports and place horse bets     when the service is good 
it was suggested that i could find bridal dresses and when i arrived it look like a close out sale  i asked where the bridal dresses and they didnt have any such thing  waste of time and gas 
i have had three cars serviced here  volvo  toyota  and kia   i cannot say enough great things about this garage   the garage is incredibly clean  and the mechanics are knowledgeable and friendly   this garage actually treats you as a human person and is very respectful of your car and pocketbook   never have i felt as if they were adding on unnecessary repairs   i will continue to take my cars into this garage for major service and repairs 
i was new to the area and needing an annual skin check  i found them on google  liked that it was a female doctor so i called and booked  i saw diana  i believe shes a pa  for my skin check and she was ahhhmazing  she has great bedside manner and was very thorough  the nurse that was with her was great too  they did my biopsy the same day and didnt make me schedule another appointment to come back for it  i would definitely recommend and will probably be back for aesthetic treatments as well  they also have a great selection of skin care products which is a huge plus in my book 
i cannot say enough about little friends  first  online scheduling and payment makes getting a sitter super easy and the appointment is usually confirmed within the hour  my sitters  mary and lori are amazing with my spoiled rotten pit bull  i know they give her lots of love and belly rubs when we are gone  she loves them and they love her  it makes me so happy to get texts and photos with each visit  it puts my mind at ease because i usually worry when i go out of town without my pup  i would highly recommend little friends over boarding my pet any day 
a solid 4  the service was awesome  the breading on the fish and the chicken was flavorful and crisp   the fish and the chicken remained moist inside  the red beans and rice was very very good   hush puppies had good flavor   portion to cost was appropriate   we will defiantly return 
overall a very nice experience   our server was very polite and attentive without being intrusive   the atmosphere was nice and family friendly   the games to play at the table was a definite plus   the beer we tried was good   the food  the pizza my daughter had was good portion and nice in flavor with the sausage tending to be a tad spicy   not a bad thing   the cuban tasted fantastic  the cuban was not a traditional one but its definitely a reorderable item   the burrito was nothing special but not a bad thing  the fries   especially the truffle fries   they are a slice of pure heaven   amazing    we will definitely return 
after reading the reviews i know that i am not alone in my experience  the support staff have preveneted me from making an appointment and i still have not been provided with the results of a biopsy the doctor performed while i was in the hospital  the only kind of person i know to do this is one who is arrogant and out of tune with the nature of his  her work  it seems that support staff has the opinion they are running a spa  resort not an medical office where there are life and death issues    the doctors who are responsible for setting the tone might consider that silly and petty staff may jeopardize their practice by being forced to face unecessary issues which at the very least would distract patients from a doctors hard earned place in the community  i know if i worked long and hard at earning a doctors degree i wouldnt want to see it jeopardized by an arrogant  incompetent support staff  perhaps their office manager would consider reviewing how his  her staff is handling difficult patients  who are sick and possibly heavily medicated  or challenges  being short staffed  having a bully run the office      of course  that would take dedication and compassion somthing this practice is seriously lacking although one might assume from their lack of change that the doctors there feel a false sense of pride when people are in desperate need of their care and feedback  on the flip side to that perhaps they are doing me a favor knowing that another specialist is probably more competent to treat me  there is one character trait that is dangerous for a doctor to hold and that is fear  it is always preferable to be treated by a physician who is confident and competent not a scared doctor motivated by personal insecurities  i dont want to be forced to feed a doctors ego  i mean i get it with certain sales professions or with teenagers manipulating adults but honestly i would not expect it from a doctor or his  her office   since being released from the hospital  banner dessert  results of a biopsy performed there and by dr  castro have never been provided and the aftercare  post discharge team called once and did not bother to leave a call back number  all that after they told me it could be some sort of cancer  lymphona 
i have been wanting to try this place for a long time  especially after reading all the great reviews  but my experience at sushi neko was average at best    i did the ayce  their pricing for ayce is fair and pretty similar to a majority of the ayce sushi places here in vegas  their rolls were delicious  and their nigiri had a good fish to rice ratio    my main issue was with their customer service  their staff is very friendly  but i had to ask multiple times just to get my water refilled even once  i didnt receive 2 of my orders  even after i asked my waitress about them    also  their mini honey toast dessert was very displeasing  i was expecting honey toast  and i was served a hawaiian roll that was drenched in honey and topped with some ice cream    all in all  i would definitely come back for the sushi 
as a lover of monta  their sister ramen spot in the southwest side of town didnt disappoint  similar to monta  its fairly small without a ton of seating  4 5 tables to sit families of 4  and bar seating   and ive only had to wait at most maybe 30 minutes    friendly customer service  4 different soup bases  shoyu  chicken   tonkotsu  pork   miso  chicken   pork   and a vegetarian bowl  they all come with a decent amount of toppings  and you can also ask for extra toppings  you can pick how spicy you want your broth  not spicy  mild  medium  and hot  as for their extra dishes  ive only had their pork belly bowl so far  and it was amazing  delicious  salty pork belly on top of garlic rice    ive come here twice already  and im glad to have a good ramen spot so close to my house 
after going to at least four different wedding dress shops i would have to say this one is a winner   the first store ignored me  the second one made me wait on a couch that looked like it had been picked up off of the street  the women in the third store insulted me when i told them that i was going to be wearing sandals at my beach wedding   needless to say i was pleasantly surprised at this place     1  the little old foreign  russian  german   woman who was assigned to me was hilarious and very truthful   when i hesitated at completely stripping down to just undies she was like  what   i have seen more of those than you can imagine   loose the bra    also  that is not good  get it off now   and  that is amazing and you would be crazy to wear anything else    she was very excited and wouldnt let me do anything other than check it out in the mirror   also she was very good  she had the dress that i fell in love with and bought by the 2nd try   2  the store gave me a 15  discount on both the dress and the veil after only 10 minutes of negociating   3  the seamstress was awesome and was able to get everything done in only 2 days   overall a great experience
exceptionally delicious  the staff is great  they have my daughter a free cookie once and now we always buy one  their prices are very reasonable and you can tell they use good quality ingredients  i highly recommend the apple fritter and snoogle 
if possible to give zero stars i would    horrendous in so many ways  google reviews speak for themselves but for some reason the star rating is still at 3 9 lolll what a joke of an establishment
this place is phenomenal   prices are awesome as well   they have huge portion sizing and the flavor of food is great   my favorite is the pad see u and the red chicken curry   they have great delivery if you live close or within 3 miles  service is excellent everytime we visit   give this place a try  
love love love this place   the pb lover with acai is the best   if you love pb and banana and gronala this is for you   super reasonable pricing  i eat these all the time super filling fresh and delicious 
absolouty love this place   everything is good especially corn beef hash   bagels are amazing   bakery is fantastic  we have been eating here every week   love it 
great food  great service  love the feel of the place  of course bacon jam is the best  we had mac and cheese which was amazing  burgers are to die for  gyro tacos and mushroom flat bread pizza was also just as good  very friendly place and servers who know what good foods to pick  drinks were par as well  visit this place you wont regret it     
very fresh with wonderful variety of sushi  sides  salad and grill items   it was our first time here and we should have followed rule  1 for the ayce   we ordered all of our favorite sushi and rolls plus grilled pork belly   it was a lot of food   when you order the sushi  they ask you how many   since it was my husband and myself  i said 2   but the waiter didnt mean individual pieces but orders so it was like getting twice the amount of sushi i thought i ordered   tip   next time  i want to have the feel of a whole meal from the ayce so ill only order sushi and maybe only one soft crab shell roll  because rolls are super filling  so that ill have room for a poke salad  seaweed salad  grilled pork belly  and must have lychee sherbet   its refreshing and addicting 
i havent been to this location in a while and i probably wont be back  i remember it being more customer friendly  i understand that its busy but theres no reason to rush your customers into an order then make them wait a few minutes while your trying to figure out the orders of the people already being helped  before i knew it the employees decided what i wanted in my burritos and they were all wrapped up going through the oven cause i wanted them enchilada style  thats when i was told that they only put the  toppings  on the side now  every other time ive been here ive been able to choose what goes into my order  i just wanted some lettuce and tortilla strips in my burrito  feeling confused i just went along with it cause i had a two for one coupon and was just looking for a quicker deal for dinner  saving a little bit of money it still came out to more than twenty bucks  with the food not being prepared how i wanted it and feeling unvalued as a customer is leaving me pretty disappointed in my choice of place for dinner
so ive been here a couple of times and was underwhelmed on each occasion   the first time my sister and i ordered their strawberry crepe which ended up being a crispy crepe scarcely filled with strawberry jam  really    the following time i came i was seated by the window which had a poster of their green tea red bean slush  so when i ordered it  i actually pointed to the poster  cant go wrong  right  after waiting a good 15 minutes  this place wasnt packed with people  for my drink i got a green bean slush    sigh  the waitress was apologetic and i couldnt be bothered to send it back   the drink itself was fine  in general  theyre comparable to other bubble tea places   just not what i ordered    im done with this place 
love the look of this place   high ceilings  exposed brick  distressed wooden shelves   bar counter by the window   they actually have two espresso machines so two baristas can work back to back on the drinks   its pretty awesome being able to see them at work  the guys are laid back  have that hipster look and no attitude    i had their latte which was great  the milk was velvety  a nice layer of micro foam though i thought it was a bit too much    theres limited seating in the actual cafe but there are a couple of tables in the foyer just outside 
 3 5 star review  the space is great with plenty of seating  theres a long communal table in the front  a few four seaters in the back along with another communal table  theres an patio in the back but the space isnt open   yet  waiting for the furniture  im assuming     i had the 5 ounce cappuccino which i found too acidic  sour for my palate   id have to come back to try the latte   the scones   cookies are from circle and squares so they have to be good 
yummeh   i was craving something sweet with my friend while we were walking through the path so he took me here   they have a number of mini puff pastries flavours so while i figured i should only have one  trying to be good  the worker advised that they sell the mini pastries in sets of four  well  i couldnt argue with that    ill take the apricot  sour cherry  chocolate and apple   vanilla pudding ones then   the pastries were all flakey and were like two bite puffs   the sour cherry wasnt really sour but did taste like cherry and i didnt care for the sourness anyway so that worked for me   i had the chocolate   cherry consecutively and thought that they should have a chocolate cherry puff   now that would be good  the 4 pastries were only  2 50   a great price  especially for a place in the path    note  they also offer savoury puffs 
our second visit here and this place will definitely be a prominent fixture in our trips to montreal   what i love about the food is that it doesnt try to get too experimental for the sake of being cool but still exhibits creativity  competency and most of all flavor      let me tell you about my bouillabaisse   it is a dish i love to order but is usually a bit heavier than i like in the end   this version was more or less deconstructed with outrageously well prepared seafood sitting in a thin layer of the richest most flavorful broth i have every tasted     my other half had a truffle gnocchi which makes you sit up an take notice of the difference between truffles and truffle oil   this was the real deal and was unusual in that the pieces were very small and delightfully light   we sat at the bar and enjoyed cocktails and banter with the bar tender which is just the way we like our upscale dining experiences   the sample of four creme brulee was a perfect end to the evening 
one of the few places i can go where i have several items i love  i have tried so much off their menu  love every one of them  so i stand there when i go in  staring at the menu  trying to decide  its made as you order it  no sitting under heat lamps and not at all greasy 
quick update  my nails did last me almost a month  which is standard for me since my nails grow insanely fast  they still looked really good toward the end  but did require a small amount of upkeep underneath  because im crazy messy   anyway  still the same rating  for the price  amazing  treat people how you want to be treated 
i love this place for its unique and inexpensive jewelry   i just bought a very interesting silver ring and pair of earrings for less than  60   no matter what ive bought here  i never see it on anyone else  unlike chain jewelry stores with their cookie cutter designs   ack     they have another location on state st   but this ones my favorite based on their bigger selection  layout and  not insignificantly  the ease of getting a parking space right out front 
former guu  japanese izakaya  if you are tired of sushi  which i cant  or try another type of happy hour with great snack food  heres the best  i love their kakimayo  oven cooked oyster with mayo on top  the japanese draft beer is very refreshing  my husband love the beef tongue a lot and the loud environment  ebi mayo is very goood    
beautiful small salon with friendly professionals who really care about clients and hair 
had a nice time at this wine bar and restaurant   the place is definitely hip inside   the food we ordered was excellent  especially the yummy  interesting appetizers    and happy hour prices are awesome   i highly recommend the skirt steak app and the crab  shrimp cake app   but im with the last reviewer   their food is way overpriced   we stuck with the happy hour priced appetizers because the regular menu starts around  18 for an entree   that is insane   not only that  im not a wine expert  but id think that a place that is a wine bar would have more by the glass choices   their one pinot was definitely not my fave   i switched to their house cab after my first glass     cool place  good choice for happy hour  but yowza  be prepared to drop some cash if you stay for dinner 
im trying to visit all the celebri chef eateries in vegas and i finally had the chance to try a wolfgang establishment   i picked this place because of the high rating on yelp and it seemed like a low key place to eat right before catching zumanity across the street at nyny    for some reason after taking a quick glance at the menu  the gf and i werent feeling the food  maybe because it was  bar  food and weve been eating earl of sandwich everyday since we got into town  it took a while to decide  but we decided to split the butter lettuce caesar salad and the entree of organic chicken  we also ordered the honey lime aid  perfect for those into sour drinks   the portions are huuuuge so it was good we split the food  very simple and traditional take on classic dishes    service is fast  theres so many waiters attending to you and some even dressed in suits 
wtf was that living gardens show about  it was the most boring shit ever  it was at the waterfall and apparently has multiple showtimes  3 ladies dressed up as trees or some shit moving hella slow to classical music pretending to blossom  i cant believe a crowd of 100  people actually showed up to watch it  just glance by it if you ever come across it  window shop for a bit  then head to the casino    ps  happy 100th review to me 
enchiladas   amazing  red  burro   amazing  cannot speak any more highly of this place  it is a little hole in the wall  or maybe i should say a house converted into a to go counter  but that is just the appeal of this place  you get some down home cooked mexican food  this place comes highly recommended 
great food  bacon is awesome   frittatas and kielbasa breakfast sandwich are a nice change of pace 
best buffet in the world  nah   i do like them but they are very pricey with that huge price tag  30  more than the next priciest vegas buffet      unusual delights we found are beef briskets  well done  best of the buffets   jumbo shrimp  as you cant find bigger elsewhere   lamb chop  disappointed with  68 pp and you still have to pay extra for the lobster  for that price you can get all lobster dinner for two in average restaurants  and yes stone crab  but after paying  3 for 2 claws in publix florida it is difficult to be impressed  and publix tastes better because it is freshly cooked   ethnic food are aplenty  all less than authentic  chinese  japanese similar in quality to bellagio but they do have spicy crab  and i enjoyed the porridge which is one of the best   mexican dishes there are quite a few and yes probably bacchanal has the best mexican dishes for a buffet  ya happy    family is very fond of the great pastry and little cute utensils they have for things    service is so so  it is xmas and i dont see any smile on the waitress face  so we paid someone else the tips  and they are not up to speed with cleanup and refreshments   dont forget to go there and put your reservation in  yes you cant reserve on the phone  and wait the next 2 3 hours  they might call you in 45 minutes  but you never know 
is this the best buffet in terms of presentation  quality of food  yes  is this the best buffet ive had  no   its brightest spot is pastry  which is not my thing  i would give it a 5 star  its meat section i would say is 3 star for me considering its price  it does have lamb but i would expect lamb chop  again for its price  it has roast beef and ribs but i expect steak  maybe it does but certainly not the grilled types i love   seafood selection  crab legs pretty good and i like that they cut it open so lazy people like me just take it out to eat  but that is about it  mussels too cheap for my taste  shrimp not so impressive   basically lacking the wow factor other than the pastry  i paid  50  maybe xmas is just the wrong time to have buffet in vegas 
we were first time customers of papa johns   taken in by the  better ingredients      tag line  we opted to try   not a good experience   the ingredients may be  better  but there was so little to the pizza it was shameful   we could hardly discern any taste to the product   price was  10 for a 14  2 topping pizza but a bargain is not what you spend  it is what you get   in the future we will get pizza from italian restaurants to get something with more substance and taste  
i love this place  its so cute  kind of like a serendipity  one of the best coffees ive ever had  i brought back the hot chocolate in a jar to give to my friends as gifts  they all loved it  i wish there were a place like this in miami 
my husband and i came here to look for a new car  not only did we find one  but we had the best experience thanks to preston and mark  they were so friendly and went over and beyond their job  even had my nissan armada washed while we waited for the paperwork   i will definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family
the doughnuts were definitely creative  the taste was average  just your typical doughnut i feel you could get anywhere  the service was really good  but because we came later in the day  most of the doughnuts were old or not available anymore 
i am not a buffet person  youd think that because of my picky palette that i would be    but no  i usually find the food very bland and mediocre   while  the food here was nothing special  it was a beautiful location  the cobblestone  and the tables  it had a great setup  one of the nicest of the buffets ive been to in las vegas  and ive been going almost every year since i was 3 years old   that explains the third star   the fourth star is because of the kindness and customer service we received  my mother is somewhat of a kleptomaniac  except she asks before she takes  she was enamored with the coffee cups that the buffet had  they were very cute  she asked the waitress if she could buy them or take them  etc  and the waitress said   one moment   let me check   usually  when my mom does this  we are given rude responses  when the waitress returned  she gave my mother a set of 6 coffee cups for free  we left her a great tip  and my mom was very happy   this was around 2003 or so  and we still have the coffee cups  i wish i could say more about the food  but its a buffet  thats about all i can say 
we bought a full kitchen set from the bethel park location  zach was very helpful with the entire process  the installation guys were awesome  even helping us to move our existing fridge to the basement    we had a minor issue with the ice maker the day of delivery that we didnt notice until later that evening  called dons the next day and they had a tech out the same day  dan fixed the issue in 15 minutes    very happy with our experience at dons appliance 
just missed the lunch crowd at 1pm  limited seating but service was very fast  sushi is really good  good came out very fast as well  ordered  sat at nice table by window   my food  3 rolls  came out within 8 10 minutes  i had a rainbow roll  spicy tuna   spicy salmon roll  all were very good  ill be back 
mel rocks this brow joint  i had been going to someone with 20 years of experience  but switched to melt and couldnt be happier 
happy hour is the best hour  kevin was amazing and he served us quality food  the flavors and presentation was everything   definitely coming back and that is why im giving them 5stars   
no bueno  i would not go back there
they take pride in guest service  the prices seem to be equal with most theatres  the employees are friendly and always smiling 
came here for a tea tasting  they also sell tea from a local proprietor   and found out i love this place   i am a bit of a chocolate snob  so the first thing i noticed was the white chocolate has a bit of yellow to it  this is good people   white chocolate that is too white looks that way because more fat and sugar has been added to stretch it  none of those cheap tricks here   i also like that its a small family business  owners are sisters  ruby jane was their grandmother   which i always feel good supporting   alright  enough rambling  onto the chocolate   what i had  white chocolate bark with caramel and toasted coconut   my favorite item    and one of the cheaper ones since it didnt have heavy stuff like caramel and peanut butter  most items are priced by weight    macadamia and cashew caramel nut clusters with dark chocolate   well ok  if you twist my arm   so yummy  and used whole nuts   white chocolate covered almonds   simple and tasty  would get these again   dark chocolate peanut butter cup  probably my least favorite thing   it was still good  but not out of this world   dark chocolate covered caramel   excellent caramel  but i like mine topped with a nice sea salt for the sweet  salty flavor combo  and their version didnt have that touch 
came here early on a friday evening for dinner   maybe we just werent in a rush  but i didnt see any problem with the service like others have mentioned   decent wine and beer selection  probably about  1 more per drink than im used to seeing  which for the atmosphere here was fine   it has a nice modern feel without crossing into yuppy   i ordered the baked ziti with chicken  which was really good   the boyfriend had a filet  which was good but drastically overcooked  he ordered medium rare  and it came out nearly well done   he decided after the first bite it was still good  so i cant fault them too much since we didnt complain and give them the opportunity to fix it  we also got a side of truffle tots  and you could really taste the truffle oil  i recommend those   overall  good place to grab a drink  food was good  and the atmosphere worth coming for 
considering i was given a completely different price then what they tried to then charge me double at delivery  i would have to recommend to never order from here  on top of that the staff was completely rude and could care less to apologize or try to rectify the situation  i truly appreciate that the owner took the time to respond  therefore i am giving you more stars so my review wont hurt your business   
great experience   dr  jesse and staff are very professional which has made my experiences pleasant and expectations met 
my hubby and i love spanish tapas   its hard to find a reasonably priced in los angeles or orange county california  so i was excited and we enjoyed all the food immensely  they were even very considerate of my hubbys shrimp allergy and made the paella with a chicken  beef broth   i think   next time we are in lv we will absolutely eat there  i also enjoyed because my daughter was able to eat a variety of things too 
tourists love this place  most montrealers think this place is average at best  unless youre a little bimbo who thinks youre participating in some  scene  by being there    the food is pretty good but the experience is ruined by idiot waiters making  5 an hour who treat the patrons like garbage  crowding them at the bar  ignoring them  and then berating them when they try to select the appropriate bottle of wine  which  i might add  i dont think any waiter in there could ever afford on their salaries    now i try not to judge a place on one visit unless its really good  so i gave it another chance and went back a few months later  same bullshit experience  then again  a few months later  for someones birthday  same thing  i was starting to think it was just me  until i asked around and most people have the same negative experience    its a bit of a shame  really  because the chefs are talented and the decor is pretty  too bad about the insecure waiters 
they did a terrible job and  customer service was  is very unprofessional  the quarts  counter top which was installed improperly is two different colors   the sink is falling in  the counter top was chipped during installation   there is water damage to my brand new cabinets and my drywall from counter top not being installed correctly   the counter top is not attached to cabinets   the owner signed a contract and did said he didnt know me and that we had no relationship   the owner wants me to pay the balance due because he said that the project was complete    i think not   pictures are available upon request   they get a h    no rating   evergreen homes inc  dba  39 dollar granite 
castle board game happens to be a great location for me because i live close to chinatown   they have a big space with areas in the front and back of cafe   unlike snake   lattes  you do not feel cramped on small tables   two of us were at the cafe on a saturday afternoon   the place got busy quite quickly but not to the point where there is a line going out the door   i guess it is because there are more gaming places in town now   they could use a little more staff because although the staff here are also knowledgeable  they have to also quickly attend to new customers walking through the door   we were being coached on games but they had to excuse themselves a couple of times     they have a good variety of games and i like how they have organized the games on the shelves as well   simple masking tape with names  but i appreciate it because it helps me narrow down quickly what games i want to play   hopefully they continue to expand their collection because there was one game we were looking for they did not have   we also had the key lime cheese cake   surprisingly  the desert was really good   they serve anything a coffee and desert shop would have also   in addition  you can serve yourself water flavoured with lime   it is something simple  but you are not waiting around for a waiter or waitress to fetch you water   the cost was was reasonable in comparison to other places   i would be coming back to this location more often due to convenience and its big space   note  do not think they have their liquor license   that would be a plus if they did 
ive been craving pizza all day  i am grateful you made the trip even though my hotel sends you away  i wouldnt of ordered had i known this in advance  im sure its stated somewhere and i missed it   im slightly sad because i ordered extra marinara sauce for dipping my garlic knots but instead i have two ranch dips   my hawaiian pizza is good  and hits the spot  while it doesnt look as yummy  brick house cooked  as the pictures  it does look beautifully crafted and clean 
i have tried to get on board with the food here many times  as my boyfriend orders it for work  i have tried many dishes but she feel something is lacking  i do like the spring rolls but mostly for the dipping sauce  i took my son to dinner tonight to try the dine in option  his meal was ok  the sweet chicken and mac n chz  but how could anyone not get that right   the staff looked annoyed  all of them  not one person smiling  took them 5 minutes of me standing at the front for one of them to drag themselves away from whatever they were doing  while i am at it  the lighting is awful  totally too bright and the track lights point right in the diners eyes  the food is not bad  its just not that great  and it is pricey  sorry   
quick with delivery and never mess up my order   great deals if you use the app
good gluten free dining option if you are  menu savvy   my husband and i dined here today for lunch   we had a great overall experience   we were seated promptly and our waitress was both speedy and friendly   the restaurant does not offer a separate gluten free menu nor does it designate any menu items as gluten free   our waitress was not knowledgeable on the subject either   so  if you have to maintain a gluten free diet youre on you own here   my husband and i ordered the grilled chicken risotto   it was delicious   loved it   so good   for dessert my husband tried the key lime pie   he said it was good  not great  but good standard key lime pie   i had the creme brulee  the only gluten free dessert option    i was a little wary after having a bad creme brulee at bernardins  but as it was my only option i went for it   the difference was night and day   it was very good and i was happy with my choice   one thing to look out for  the dining room is quite noisy   my husband and i were able to converse but it was mildly challenging   overall a great dining experience we wouldnt hesitate to do again 
i love this place  only been there twice  but everything ive had has been exceptional  crispy spring rolls  fresh pork   shrimp spring rolls  pho  grilled squid with vermicelli noodles   all absolutely delicious  cute little place  nice but simply decorated  the staff is courteous and attentive  currently one of my fave restaurants in charlotte  
we came here for lunch on a college visit tour  the place was overwhelmed and we waited a good long time  but our waiter was great to talk with  and treated us well  the owners mother  ya gotta meet and youre just going to love candy   even sat with us and treated us like family    this is a great setting  and the food was surprisingly good  well worth the visit if youre anywhere near the cwru campus 
went back for a second visit to get a toe polish change   to remove nail shellac   apply a new color  i cant rave enough about how great their method of removing shellac is  totally painless   100  effective with zero nail damage  another flawless application of shellac   i really like this place  however  like majority of nail salons the technicians speak in their language with each other   pretty much non stop  its a very irritating thing to listen to not to mention quite rude but otherwise this is an excellent nail salon   i will definitely return 
over the top vegas style  our range safety officer was genaro  awesome guy and super helpful  my wife and i did the early bird special where we saved 15  before 9 30am  we shared the four star general package and subbed out the browning 1919 for the mg 42  so we shot the mg 42  m 60  m 249 and m 240   all of the guns were great  but the best was the mg 42  although what we shot was expensive  its totally worth it  the experience was the highlight of our trip  there are other fully automatic weapons you can shoot even if you dont have a lot of cash to spend  we even went back later in our trip to shoot again 
 chia pudding  tables at outdoor dining area  beet burger
great italian food  the antipasto is a perfect starter and the linguine with clams is delicious  favorite local spot 
this place is full of surprises  i walk in and see a few products that i have not seen before  anyways this is my goto nutrition shop  never will i shop anywhere unless they dont have the product i am looking for  have i mention cheap  not going to mention any other nutrition stores but when it comes to cheap  this is the place 
pretty standard choice for thai in new town but heres the warning label just so youre prepared   1  beware the noise   its always busy and even if youre not loud when you come in  some acoustic quirk means you soon will be to be heard above the base level din  intimate tables for two may be better off elsewhere  2  starters are mostly overpriced   focus on the more generous mains  3  the waiters dont smile  though i think they aaalmost cracked this time when my very english dining buddy tried pronouncing the dishes in a thai accent    ill probably be back to satisfy my thai cravings when im next up north plus theres huge variety on the menu  if you can handle the above then its worth a try too   
what happens when edinburghs most deadpan bartender meets my most under the influence colleague on a thursday evening   it takes him half an hour to order a drink  thats what  they may as well have been talking different languages  well my colleague might have been  the bartender was mostly impassive   this is more of a food place  but we spotted a cocktail menu in the window so dashed in for a drink and some shelter from the monsoon outside  i ordered an old fashioned and thought it was a nice touch that he asked me my choice of whisky  out of two  but it was appreciated    i settled down at one of the high tables by the bar counter with another colleague who was keen for a bit of a deep   meaningful  and we pretty much forgot about the other two guys we were with for the next 20 minutes as we were deep in conversation  eventually we realised 1  our drinks still hadnt arrived  and 2  the other two still hadnt managed to order  confusion all round   i eventually got my drink which was unfortuantely quite watery  and im not sure what my colleague got but it didnt taste like any manhattan id ever tried  i think the other two eventually settled on beers  so it ended up being a good chat spot for me  but not the most successful drinks stop  hence the low rating for now  i should probably come back for food though and give it another shot  i would also urge you to mind the step up to the street right outside   as one of my colleagues learned the painful way in his eagerness to bundle into our taxi afterwards   
i simply couldnt have asked for a more perfect wedding breakfast than the meal we had here  we were a group of 14 seated in the beautiful semi private cage area where youre surrounded by golden lamps and lush dark wood carvings  my  now  husband and i are obsessed with asian food and we wanted somewhere with the wow factor to treat our nearest and dearest after our ceremony   so hakkasan fit the bill perfectly on both counts  my main concern was that it lived up to the hype  particularly given the steep price tag we were paying  i neednt have worried   we were treated like royalty  i think turning up in my white dress got me some extra love too hehe   and most importantly the food was both delicious and very generously portioned  wed chosen a set group menu of their signature dishes in advance and the only requirement was that the veggies sat together as its all served family style for sharing  i only wish i could have managed to eat more  we got through plenty of drinks meanwhile  mostly sticking to their gorgeous cocktail menu  then splurged on some japanese whisky flights at the end of the meal for a special treat  the staff were polite and attentive and the front of house lady in charge of our table took care of us extremely well  we hadnt quite hit our minimum spend by the end of the meal  miraculously   so they let us continue the party at their sexy bar counter  where the highlight was my maid of honours 5 cocktails in speech  we certainly paid a premium price  but im so grateful we got the premium treatment plus our guests were all blown away   its not an experience any of us will forget for a long  long time   
my third visit to this upmarket veggie place and ive always left nicely satisfied   previous times ive booked in advance  which youll need to do   its always busy   but they dont take bookings during the fringe so we joined the 30min queue out the door on a friday night    the menu has limited  5 mains  but interesting choices  an unexpected mix of euro  indo  asian creations  the previous hit and miss reviews make me think ive somehow managed to only pick hits  on this visit that was the ardrahan smoked cheese and tomato tartlet for starters  not wow but nice   and the more impressive chilli pancake stuffed with a mix of yummy beans  with grilled sweet potato  salsa and chocolate sauce  trust me  somehow it works      so thumbs up for tastiness  and i love the aubergine walled look of the place too  but not a five star because a  its pricey for what you get so more of a special meal  and b  the service is slow  but super friendly so just dont go if youre in a rush    ive pleased both veggie and non veggie mates with this place  and bonus hi five for the biodynamic wine on the list too   
really yummy food  it seems toronto gets an a  for their vegan food  i want to move here just so i can get the chicken and waffles at this place for breakfast every morning  havent got to try the lunch  dinner menu but definitely going back to try it  the unchicken was so good i had it the other day and am craving it now like crazy    love it   
i love this place  its great for in the winter or fall time if you miss flowers and to get away from the cold and muck outside  its really big for a place that is free admission  which i love and good for students    i will go again for sure  especially try and go in the summer time  flowers and plants here are so beautiful and look really well taken care of 
i did not realize just how far it is walking from the last hotel with air conditioning on this side of las vegas blvd to mgm on the 4th of july when its 121 degrees out    turns out  its really  really  re hee heealy f cking far   thankfully  theres the abc store on the way and it is savagely air conditioned  they sell ice cold beverages galore  theyve got sunscreen  tchotchkes  and the general hawaiian spirit that i love so much    did they have the thing i wanted  no  but they had so much more and probably saved my life that day getting in from the blistering dessert heat 
phoenix sky harbor international airport  the portrait of inefficiency    phoenix is a legit city  its bustling and friendly and theres no shortage of reasons to come visit  in fact i can only think of one thing that would keep me away and thats having to snail walk through security check points with not nearly enough security personnel and an incredibly outdated system    ive never been in a slower line anywhere  their machine takes forever to reset in between people  the security agents bicker with each other or general airport rules  and they have no idea how efficiently use their staff and equipment for the betterment of everyones experience and manner    beyond the total failure to be able to process what was actually a pretty short line of people through to their gates  the food and beverage options are abysmal at best 
great mall  cool shops  lots to look at  their stores are awesome and you can find a lot of high end stuff here  theres a fashion show every hour  hence the name  their gamestop was awesome  since i found a wii fit for my bf here 
was very disappointed to here the owner katina foster openly trashing her employees  very unprofessional
the secret is out and and the high ratings and hype is all real    its located on the 3rd floor inside the cosmopolitan hotel in an unmarked hallway  if you cant find it  simply ask anyone who works at the hotel and theyll gladly direct you    yes  the wait can get very long  especially if you come after nightclub hours  its packed with lots of late night eaters and drunk party goers   get the white pizza  its bomb 
first of all this place is extremely awesome  i love there tacos  and the employees are so sweet always nice and friendly  place is clean every time i come  everything prepare nicely and fresh       by far my favorite place to eat tacos
love it here  one of my favorite hotels in vegas  the nicest also  my girlfriend and i went here and we requested the highest floor so we got a room on the 60th floor the view was amazing we got to see the shows from tressure island from our room it was great  the rooms are very luxurious and bed you could melt in  serious  plasma screen tv in the room and in bathroom  vaulted ceilings very nice decor  the general casino area is very nice and with 25 dollars i made  900 00 on craps  it seemed like everyone was winning here too  i am a big pool guy  i love hotels with a good pool setup  so when we were going check out the pool we started walking along the pool and saw a bunch of kids and families wtf            but then i started hearing loud club music and it was 11 00 am  i mean you could feel the floor shake from the base  so i walked towards it then i moved some bushes out of the way and saw a huge pool for 21 over section with topless women  outside poker and blackjack tables  huge center bar and 50 year old men acting like 21 year olds throwing frisbees around  it exceeded all of my expectations  try the nice restaurant at the wynn for a romantic evening   alex  very nice but be prepared to shell out  1000 00 for 2  last night we were there i met flavor flave he was staying on our floor with his family  ugly bastard i might ad lol  all in all this hotel is 5 stars all the way would definetly go back                
decent enough drive through chicken  biscuits seemed a little dry the last time  but all in all not bad for the money 
the environment at this pediatric dental office was so fun  i didnt want to leave    the waiting room caught my attention offering a fun   friendly environment for kids  there is a small theater room to watch a movie while you wait at check in  a game area and colorful  fun wall art  the dental hygienist took her time and cleaned my childs teeth with patience   ensuring a comfortable experience  dr  cox was nice  quick with his examination   answered our questions  the office appeared to be well staffed   professional  in the operatory  movies are played while kids wait for treatment or hygiene  a separate room is reserved for kids who are not comfortable with treatment   need a little more privacy
booked a premium level car   was given a 46 000  mile chevy impala  crappy suspension  bald tires  squeaky passenger side window  also smelled like someone sprayed stuff to cover up a smoker  will never use this company again 
i went to this salon thanks to yelp  i was very pleased with the service and with the prices  i have searched for years for a decent hair stylist and hit the jackpot with ricky  everyone in the salon is friendly and the place is upbeat even when they are busy  it was the first time i got exactly what i asked for  ricky did an amazing job and actually listened to what i had to say  i wanted something low maintenance and he showed me a quick way to style the hair that i can actually replicate at home  they also handle all ethnicities of hair 
this place is horrible it feels like a free clinic  after 3 attempts to get blood work results   they called to cancel my appointment 2x with only an hours notice  i get to my appointment 1 hour early and as im checked in they tell me that its going to be at least 90 minutes from my appointment time  interestingly enough a panera lunch delivery arrived and a few minutes later they all went to a  nurses meeting   health care partners really need to take a look at the way this place is run  totally unacceptable in my book 
great sushi restaurant in chinatown  all of the ingredients were very fresh and tasty  we all had the ayce and it was totally worth it  the service was excellent also   well be back 
this is a great neighborhood gem  everything here is good  the crazy alfredo is my favorite  they tend to be really busy and sometimes the hostess can get into the weeds when it comes to seating people  but dont worry theyll get to you  its worth the wait    april 2017 update this is based on the rude customer service the  hostess  gave my wife over the phone when she was confirming a dinner reservation  heres a tip  if youre not nice to loyal customers you lose customers  we went to capos instead  everyone there was lovely 
great little neighborhood gem  a real mom and pop restaurant  everything is homemade and tastes great  the wife had eggplant parmigiana and i had the mussels  both great  had the fresh cheesecake  im not a real fan of cheesecake but this was really good  they have  5 corking fee which im sure well be using in the future 
this store offers you everything that you will ever need to make crafts or build something pretty  i am bummed that they put their holiday decorations on sale before the holiday even happened  this causes the items to be sold out fast  it frustrates me when i want to buy craft items for my 2nd grade students  everything is over picked    when there is a long line they only have 1 person checking people out  i thought ulta beauty was the only store who did this to their customers    the store has many items from decorations  scrapbooking  cake making and floral arrangements  they also offer wedding items if you want to go the diy route  and be creative  framing is also available at this location    they offer a teacher discount with proper school id 
huevos rancheros are edible but eggs are out of a carton so your only choice is scrambled  service was good but the food is not  not sure why charlotte cant get a good restaurant at the airport 
out of state buyer  my experience w   goldies was perfect  allison reiner was a consummate professional  she was highly communicative  a quick and efficient responder  and went above and beyond to manage my expectations on every detail of the car  in our first conversation she assured me that goldies would guarantee my happiness    and she delivered  dont be afraid to buy remotely  they stand by their product and promise 
nternet sitesinde calma saatleri 4 pm   4 am yaziyor 30 miles yol yapip gittikten sonra kapal olmas tam bir hayal krkl acilen saatlerini web sitenizden duzeltmelisiniz     dont open this restaurant night time  
i loved their dinner box and the pizza was amazing  a really good place to get chicken and pizza from
take out order     1  steak well done instead of medium well 2  lettuce seemed to chunks of a wedge  even for the cobb salad  3  chicken for cobb extremely salty
one of the better ethiopian restaurants in the country  i loved it  ive been going to ethiopian restaurants for the last 30 years   all over the country  this was a great find  its not far from the strip  you can walk   or a short cab or uber ride  definitely worth the trip  if you are into ethiopian food  service was friendly and the injera was delicious     
service ok    pizza was very average   not bad for late night pizza delivery  will probably use them again for late delivery 
omg i am obsessed with my sisters closet  how do you guys think its over priced  ive gotten so many amazing deals here i couldnt believe it  i go once every two weeks and i always find something  the shoe selection at this location is to die for  i got some great channel sneakers for  100  ive been shopping at msc since i was 14 with my mom i am now 24 and im still shopping here  i also love the fact that they donate to one of my favorite foundations  womens fresh start foundation  their attic store also sells great furniture  only thing i can say is some of the staff is rude  i asked one employee to help me zip up a dress i was looking to buy and she made an ugly face and said she didnt want to to touch me and walked away  however i will not let her snotty attitude stop me from shopping there because i wont find these amazing deals anywhere else  and most of the other staff is kind to me  plus im also saving to buy a herve leger dress from them since my closet is clearly in need of one 
avoid this taco bell at all cost  do not give this place any business whatsoever  they have some of the worst customer service ive ever dealt with  there is one worker in particular his name is sean  he is rude and doesnt care about making the customer happy  very unprofessional  i was going to spend a decent amount of money there by buying all my co workers food mind you i have 15 co workers  and thanks to mr  sean i didnt spend one penny nor do i plan to ever again  ive been going to taco bell for many years now and i never have i got treated the way i did at this one  i guess home is where the heart is because at my local taco bell on 30th st and thomas i always get the best service  its a shame that the employees at this bell location have no idea what they are doing  even as i spoke to the manager he wasnt of any help  he didnt care to take care of the situation and ignored me  its okay though i rather go give my business to filibertos who serve actual mexican food 
i been here before about a year ago  havent stopped by since then  i decided to go last week and boy was i pleased  im so mad that i didnt come earlier  they have so much great items at amazing low prices  all their stuff is of great quality  you can also find cute handmade items from locals  its great how they display new amazing items on instagram and facebook and the best thing is that you can place items on hold  still havent checked out their other store and i need to immediately  i need to keep checking back once a week cause their inventory changes fast  they got a faithful customer for life     
whats good   atmosphere  price  tri tip is excellent   chocolate soufle is moist  whats bad   2 hour wait  wednesday night   this place may be a personal stopping point when entering or leaving vegas  im not a huge fan of buffets  but this is my favorite so far 
love getting my tire inspection for free here  awesome and knowledgeable employees  which makes me feel comfortable when leaving my car with them     keep up the fine work 
i went to honda west dealership to get a replacement key for my broken honda pilot remote key    the staff was very friendly and directed me to parts  they told me that instead of making a whole new key  i could just replace the out shell for alot less money   they did that for me and the key works better than before      thank you honda west and staff 
i agree with chris s 11  29 review that the service is very slow   we arrived at  6 on a saturday and was told that it would be 1 1  2 to 2 hour wait   the wait was about 1 1  4 hours  and could have been quicker  but the staff was very slow at seating people as tables became available   we had the blackened chicken and moms meatloaf sandwiches  both of which were very good   we never had grilled sandwiches like this before with the thick bread and  the amount of cheese   the fries and cole slaw were good  too   although we really enjoyed the meal  it was far too much food   i was surprised that we had to ask them to change channels on one of the tvs so that we could watch the cavs game   we will definitely go back next time we are in the cleveland area 
so happy that there is self checkout now at target it was so frustrating checking out before there was only ever one or two cashiers open with long lines and never on the side of the store you wanted it to be  love self checkout
great breakfast  i lived near by for many years and recently tried this spot it is a hidden treasure  must try  will go regularly  yummy 
martinique is awesome  she did my eyebrows great go see her at the benefit brow bar at macys arrowhead town center  she took her time  shaped my eyebrows perfect  the wax she used was painless  seriously  i have thick eyebrows and i dont trust too many people  but she did a fabulous job 
stopped in for a drink after a concert   there were a few homeless people in the parking lot and in the store  half of the drinks were unavailable  one was broken with a steady stream of liquid coming out  very dirty store  would go to another nearby convenience store next time 
saw some soul food and had to give it a try     ambience  4  5   open restaurant with just a few booths and tables  nothing special decor wise  but very clean   service  5  5   friendly cashier and workers  checked up on me during the meal and also wanted to talk and find out what brought me to try their place out   food  4 5  5   i ordered the two catfish fillets dinner for  12 99 which came with two sides  i chose greens and mac   cheese  i also added a chicken tender for  1  the catfish was delicious  i do not like heavy battered fried food  this was light and crispy with corn meal  the greens was best part  had little bits of ham in it too  the mac   cheese was okay  it didnt stand out but it was not bad  i seasoned it with some hot sauce  next time ill try a different side  the chicken tender was a little rubbery but tasted good  had a nice seasoning on it  be aware it took about 15 minutes to get my food  but i would rather wait and know its fresh   overall i would come back but try some other things  the yams looked good 
this place sucks  their craps crew doesnt know what they are doing  i played at one table where one dealer had trouble counting  more than once the stickman had to tell her how much to pay people on their winning bets   so i moved to the other table where i got ripped off for over  30 when the dealer there never paid my winning come bet  i had a come bet on the 6  while everyone else at my end had placed on 6  when it was rolled  she never paid me  she insisted she had  she said someone else must have taken my winnings and i wasnt paying attention  i told her my bet wasnt a place bet but a come bet  and the reason i know she didnt pay me was because my come and odds were still sitting on the 6    anyone who knows craps will know that on a come bet the wager is handed back along with the payout  since my wager was still sitting there  she either failed to pay it or she paid it incorrectly  either occurrence is inexcusable   to make matters worse  as i was trying to point out that my come bet was still sitting there  the shooter tossed a 7 and they cleared the table  removing any evidence of her mistake   this place blows and im never setting foot in there again  if you play craps  avoid this place 
i really like this place  the food and drink is super affordable  usually id get the b combo set that has the fried noodle and soy milk for  3   but today i just got the fried noodle for  2 50 and it was good enough to fill me up  its a small plate of food but thats what i like because then i can have room to eat or drink other stuff  i really like their soy milk and my relatives really like their soy bean  tofu pudding  service   a little rude today  long story short  we received one wrong item  told waitress  waitress looked upset  waitress walked away and told cook something along the lines of  ugh forget it  make them the other thing   ill give food 5  5  service 3  5  recommendation  soy milk  soy bean pudding  and affordable  2 50 fried noodles xd
i never leave yelp reviews but had such a wonderful experience at beaver choice  i had to leave a review right away  the food was delicious  the swedish meatballs and hunter schnitzel in particular  definitely stay and make room for the crepes  hannah the owner was incredibly friendly  sweet  and even with a packed house for a wednesday night  was attentive and made the experience all the better  highly highly highly recommend 
awful hotel  lots of time share sellers in the atrium that try luring newbies with cheap shows tickets  rooms look old and not up to par with rest of the strip  definitely keep away from here  
as an avid bikram yoga practitioner  bikram yoga toronto east is a great option in the east side  this studio has less classes available than other studios with typically three classes a day and two classes on friday and saturday during winter and spring    pro    under capacity   clean studio   great instructor    attention to details  hair ties  shower gel    spacious change room    water filter available   con    expensive   carpet in the studio    communal shower    long yoga room   overall  it is better than some of the other studios in the area  i love the cathartic feeling at the end of each class 
while i appreciate the idea of a high end bubble store  i did not enjoy the original brew hojicha bubble tea at nohohon tea   4 25     the tapioca lacks the resistance i come to love with typical bubble tea  the tea flavour is not pronounced  unfortunately  it tasted watered down to me  in my  potentially bias  opinion  steeped tea used for milk tea should be over steeped slightly  the bitterness and acidity from over steeped tea will be subdued by the addition of milk and add depth to the drink  i also did not enjoy tea cookies at nohohon  it was not enjoyable     the only item i enjoyed  from nohohon tea is the tokyo fog   3 95   matcha  vanilla  and froth milk  it is a drink i welcome on a cold night   all in all  i dont see myself visiting nohohon tea again unless i am in desperate need of bubble tea and the rest of toronto ran out of tapioca  it cost more than an average bubble tea and quality of the flavour is inferior 
do not walk into thai fantasy expecting authentic thai  you will be thoroughly disappointed  expect friendly service  belly warming food  attentive staff and genuine owner    my companion and i shared two dishes   green curry with chicken   11 95  and pad see ew   11 95   the food was delicious  our bellies were content with the flavours and amount of food    overall  come by thai fantasy for inauthentic joy molecules inducing food 
great food     ordered on yelp and was here in no time     will definitely eat here more often  i come from mississippi so its hard to beat good home cooking out here  i highly recommend this place if u love great bbq
cool atmosphere  craft cocktails  old school arcade games  board games  pool tables   3 cover when i went on a friday night
great place  good food and fun atmosphere but the wait staff is eager to up charge your bill so make sure you ask about prices   we went for dinner and the waiter was eager to suggest drinks and appetizers that were on the higher end and when i asked for salmon on my salad i didnt find out until the bill came that the roasted salmon was  8 instead of the  5 as the menu stated   when we asked he said that the smoked salmon was  5 not the roasted but he didnt bother to tell me that when i ordered   he also pushed a dessert  the bourbon pie that was very lame   just question everything they suggest 
doodad was far more better than i imagined  not only did he do a bunch of tricks but he was pretty funny  he was so funny all of the kids and adults were laughing  we had about 20 kids under 4 and he did a great job at keeping them entertained focused on the show  he was very helpful and answered all of my questions prior  sent reminders and was on time  thank you so much for coming out   
unf  their hot mocha is a delicious punch in the stomach  and so ludicrously reasonably priced that i had a hard time cutting myself off  ive found myself daydreaming about their steamed milk  i also had the banana   nutella crepes   pretty good  though it felt like it couldve used a little somethin somethin to ramp it up  a tiny sprinkling of cinnamon  maybe    so good  though  so good 
yes  delicious  their papaya salad is fantastic  i am often disappointed by this dish  but lordy it was perfect  my go to of tom kha was pretty decent  though it could have used more mushrooms  we must have come at a strange time of day  week   somehow the entire eating section was staffed by 2 women  they did an excellent job of keeping up with all the tables  despite the shortage of help 
ive been here twice  and had a pleasant time on both occasions  mochas are good and not too sweet  and the various pastries  pumpkin bread and some sort of scone  hit the spot  the building is lovely and usually quiet  with nice outdoor seating 
i finally made it here  after it being on my  to breakfast  list for months  a mocha was quite nice  and the chorizo biscuits   gravy were out of this world  the layout was a bit baffling for a n00b  and im thankful i had a veteran luxer there to guide me through the food and drink ordering 
very pleasantly surprised  my boyfriend   i ended up here after getting stuck in traffic in the strip and not having more than 30 minutes before our show started  we initially planned on going to wolfgang pucks spot so i was disappointed this was going to be a huge step down  we got seated right away and entertained by a hilarious mariachi band playing pop songs  our waitress was adorable  so friendly   accommodating  she overheard us talking about the show and promised to make sure wed be out in time  i ordered a chopped salad and my boyfriend got steak quesadillas and we were both so pleasantly surprised  my salad was fresh and delicious  only complaint is the dressing was strangely salty  but not so much that i didnt clean the plate  his quesadillas were also delicious  my main complaint was the original margarita i got was no good   oddly strong   had a funky sour  salty taste even though it was not made with sour mix  supposedly only lime agave syrup   tequila   our server brought us our bill immediately after we ordered so we could eat and run to the show  wed definitely recommend this place if youre looking for a fast no frills affordable yummy meal  atmosphere is a bar so be aware of that too 
candice is the best   i truly will not trust anyone else to wax me  i always thought waxing was a painful  almost unbearable thing   until candice  its not only practically painless  she is always so warm and welcoming  i would recommend her to anyone and everyone 
ok so i have to admit that when i first walk into an asian restaurant and there are no asians i get worried   we enters in to the restaurant entrance where there was a little bdsm feel with the hanging chains and then took an elevator up to the dining area   the first thing i noticed is that the restaurant is pristine with  clean lines and very white    there were white flowers all over the place and that made me feel even more worried that the food might not appeal to an asian palate since white flowers symbolize death     the wait staff is very attentive but they are little pushy with the liquor     i had the crab chicken corn soup    i thought 14 50 is pricey for 1 small bowl of soup but it is delicious   the taste is delicate yet delicious and you can taste each ingredient that melts in your mouth   i also had the the box dumplings which was pork wrapped in a pastry   a bit too doughy for me but it reminded me of something you would get in france   the gamers duck was crispy yet juicy and succulent   the lily bulb with yam was gentle yet again the flavor bits all meld together and the mushrooms are a must have   the sauce they are cooked in is delicious    got the blood orange and lychee for desert   lychees were not special but the blood orange is soaked in gran marnier and it is so sweet and tasty   it is expensive it so worth it    only complaint is that the hostess should learn to host and not argue with a guest    we had made a reservation with the hostess downstairs   when we went upstairs to the second hostess and told her we had a reservation she kept telling us that it wasnt a real reservation   wtf 
we came with a large group and service was sloooow  the highlight for me was definitely the vegetarian appetizer plate   an assortment of flavorful fried bites that were worth coming back for   dinner course was just okay   it seemed like almost everyone at the table felt that their dishes were mostly sauce with very little  stuff  in them  kind of made us feel like we werent getting much for our money  also   medium  spicy was not spicy at all   very nice atmosphere and decor 
we arrived at 5 30 today  saturday   there was not one car outside and we thought it was closed   we sat in the car deliberating   my husband said that we should try it and if we didnt like the looks when we got inside  we could leave   i am so glad that we stayed   first  the place is spotless   we were greeted immediately   yes  we were the only ones there  but the waitress was sweet and helpful   my husband ordered iced tea which was very good and fresh brewed   we asked questions of the menu and they were pleasantly answered   after we ordered  we were brought steaming bowls of miso soup that was very good   my husband ordered the shrimp tempura   it was a huge plate   there were some onion rings and sweet potatoes in the tempura batter   the batter was very light and not overly done   his came with a salad  very fresh and crispy  and rice   i ordered a meal that came in a stone bowl and was sizzling throughout my meal   i know that rice was on the bottom  that got crunchy  yum  from the hot stone bowl   zucchini  carrots  sprouts  meat  and a fried egg on top   oh my   delicious       we also got kimchee  sprouts  zucchini rounds made like the kimchee   when i asked for a box  i told her how delicious the zucchini was and she brought me a little container to bring home    both bathrooms were spotless  my husband said that he found his new favorite place    i imagine that around lunchtime they are much busier since they are adjacent to luke afb 
unfortunately  i cannot review the food   my review is based on calling to get a reservation  i called to make a reservation and brianna answered the phone   she was extremely rude from the get go   she said that she couldnt help me then  but she would be calling me back before 9 pm   9 came and went   i called at 9 15 and she answered the phone again   why i didnt just forget about it with the first call is beyond me   anyway  if you think she was rude the first time  the second time made the first call look like an angel had answered the first time   she was even ruder   i wanted a reservation for 5 pm on the 19th   well  her response was that there was no room for us even at that early time   thanks to her  this review reflects that call   i know that no one in our group will never attempt to go again 
pumpkin spice latte is made of real pumpkin  considering that balzac is one of the first cafes to use real pumpkin in pumpkin latter   ahem  starbucks   it is definitely one of the best place to get this specialty drink    their baked goods on the other hand  are not as great as their drinks  its likely sourced at a great place  however  i felt the croissant and scone can be fresher  my companion and i both agreed it may have sat there for more than a day  regardless  it was a positive experience  the rustic decor  multiple charger and large tables make it a great spot to recharge your phone  work and meet up with a friend 
adorable parisian bakery  the decor is beautiful  maman is vintage  quaint  and picture perfect    my colleague and i shared the plain croissant   2 75  and pistachio cake   3 50   not the best croissant i have ever eaten   flaky but very oily  the oil soaked through the bag  the pistachio cake was slightly too sweet for our tastes  the batter mix seemed uneven  the cake lacked balance    i really wanted to love maman  it seems to lack substances based on our order  perhaps i will come back to try other menu items if i am in the area 
nguyen huong food is known for extremely affordable banh mi for  2 50 each    if you look beyond the banh mi with pate  mystery meat  lettuces  pickled carrots  cilantro  grain  you will find a selection of meals to go  my favorite non banh mi on the go meal is the shrimp and sausage rice roll with a sweet and savory hoisin plum sauce hot sauce tamarind dipping sauce for  3 50  its the perfect meal for a hot summer day   if you are feeling adventurous  complete your meal with a traditional vietnamese dessert  the selection is endless  be sure to ask the staff for their favorite    
i had an short fling with a korean named kevin  if he made as good taiyaki as kevins taiyaki  then we would have potentially lasted  he didnt  so we didnt    jokes aside  kevins taiyaki is a little store within a korean supermarket   he serves the best taiyaki in town  crisp exterior with oosey gooey centre  your choice of centers  red bean  black bean  green bean or custard   no fish was harmed in the making of these taiyaki 
belmonte raw is a organic   high end  raw food store  it offers a variety of unpasteurized cold pressed juice  smoothies  raw desserts and raw meals    i wanted to love belmonte raw  unfortunately  i did not  i ordered the raw taco   9 00   jicama  tossed in a fragrant cashew sauce and wrapper inside collard greens  the flavours were good  however  liquid was coming out of the bottom of the wrap  the sauce was slightly watered down because of that  it was also messy to eat  it got on my work dress  in the future  i will spend my lunch money elsewhere 
i absolutely loved eating at ruddos  i came here for an italian dinner with my family and it was excellent  my mom had the lasagna and it had tons of cheese and meat and was awesome  my dad had the chicken parmesan and it had tons of sauce and cheese and was great  i had the linguini and sausage and the sausage was cooked perfectly and the linguini was topped with tons of sauce  the salad was great too  the bread was awesome  they have a good variety of beer at a very reasonable price  overall if you love italian food please come and try russos you will not regret it 
poke heaven very friendly service fast simple clean healthy and 0n0 thank you judith thank you uilani appreciate the aloha shown to us when we come in    if you havent already ate here come on what you waiting for   
the service needs major work  from what my sister and friends said but the last two times i went i had fun    they even gave me a free try of this pink drink that was in their fish bowl drink for the day   so maybe it depends on the night    i did notice though their bars are stocked differently so our bartender   poor guy  would have to run around to differs stands to get the material they wanted  also dont order here the girls are dancing you wouldnt get any help there    which makes sense as a guest to avoid
good music  good atmosphere  however  they should stop creating pressure on the people for buying food and coffee  people will of course do purchases  no need to do announcements every 5 minutes 
in am from wisconsin and wanted to love this place  maybe theyre bad in the salad department  for  12 95   i didnt expect a pile of wilted lettuce with a chunk of dried up  rock solid beef from some elses dinner in it  very disgusting 
last weekend my family and i went to bigs   as we made the final deal they said everything in our order would be delivered by the end of the week  it is now saturday  a full week later  no furniture     i called the store and was told that the furniture is not in  they have no idea when it will be in and there is no manager or anyone that can help me  the best they can do is have someone call me next week and maybe get the furniture delivered by next friday   do not shop here  they obviously lie about what is in stock and when they can get it to you  customer service is horrible and they dont have any managers working on the weekend  so if you have a problem  youre just out of luck   stay away 
the first time i came here the food was great and the service was awesome  second time  yesterday  our server was incredibly slow and kept forgetting us  i normally dont knock a review for slow service  but there was a hair in my sons pizza  i told the waitress and she asked if i wanted it to be made again  normally when this happens in a decent restaurant the manager comes over or theres some sort of apology    at lazy dog the waitress acted like it wasnt a bid deal and didnt offer an apology or anything  we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my son to get his food  not fun for a 4 year old  overall i feel like it should have been handled much better 
i am in love with this hotel   its so gorgeous and sumptuous that i feel like im stepping into a whole other world whenever i walk in   theres something to stare and gawk at it every way you turn   we had a great room with comfortable beds and a nice view of the strip   the shops are spectacular with lots of designer clothes  jewelry  etc   you can take a short gondola ride in a built in river in the shopping area which is a lot of fun   ive only stayed at the venetian on one occasion but it is by far the most beautiful hotel ive stayed in 
outstanding every time   lunch special can not be beat   worth a trip from anywhere   great menu   great food   great wok 
shout out to danielle and carla from bell transportation   i booked a private suv service to and from the airport to excalibur   upon arrival and departure  i received an informative email stating drivers name and contact info   both drivers were waiting on us  friendly  loaded and unloaded luggage and conversed with the group to and from the airport   i would highly recommend bell trans private shuttle service  i will pay the extra money for the convince of not having to wait on a cramped shuttle bus and stop at every hotel  money well spent   thank you danielle and carla for getting my group safely to and from the airport 
not sure what the hypes all about   food was ok   service was not good   they make you wait for a long time with bunch of open tables   finally sat  they ran out of bean sprouts salad   ok   fine   we asked for more corn  no response   granted it was day after christmas  they seemed under staffed and my server was over 4 tables   i finally got impatient with my toddler wanting to leave  started to cook my own meat because he was not paying any attention to our table   dont waste your time here and just go to hobak right down the street 
great place for great food at a great value   waiters are all very nice   fast service   two issues  first  the smoke panel up top   part of it fell twice while dining and they dont really do anything about it   secondly is the small lady thats in charge   either owner or the manager   rude 
i want to update my review  going from a 3 to a 4 star  the cleanliness of this gym is great  has no  gym smell  to it  the saunas a great  btw  they dont allow shoes to be worn in there  and i apologize to the manager for being rude to for being asked not to wear my gym shoes  i have been more then satisufied with the amount cardio machines and the vast amount of weights and weight machines      this is my first visit  therefore only a 3 star   my first impression as i walked in was the amount of cardio machines  there was staff cleaning  followed my a variety of weight machines and typical wall of free weights   i also noticed as i walked around that i did not see any  out of order  signs on any equipment   locker room seemed clean with no odor   sauna was clean with no foul stench   hopefully this standard continues  because it will become my home gym for the future 
very friendly and inviting environment  staff was friendly  tacos were great   will definitely be back 
yep    a 5 star restaurant in a shopping mall     do not be deceived  the interior is industrial  super clean and a friendly waiter  he was the only one we saw   we ate early on our way into vegas for a show   glad we found them on yelp  i ordered the bleu cheese  mushroom burger and sweet potato puffs  this alone made me curious  the presentation was excellent and those puffs  phenomenal     my hubby had the shrimp dinner  no complaints there either   our   new  favorite place to eat in henderson  just so we can try everything on that extensive menu  thanks for a great dining experience      5star for that attentive waiter     as we left patrons were filling it up    
my waiter just use his hand to show me there are two patties in my bacon cheese burger  nice    
this rating is solely based on the service provided at the restaurant   the food is great   i mean crave in the middle of the night great   however  they always seem overwhelmed and understaffed   the staff does a good job of greeting you once you arrive but that does nothing for your hunger pains   the bartender male  appears very dismissive and doesnt embody the welcomed face or culture you would expect   im sure this is caused by a lack of team atmosphere and basic customer service skills or he could just hate life         with all that being said the food is amazing but the service makes you want to find another amazing place   empty or full confusion exist   come hungry and patient 
heres yet another establishment that thinks its better than its customers  first  i was expecting a more relaxed  bohemian coffeehouse atmosphere  instead  it was a restaurant where a pretentious waiter  complete with an attitude  wanted to tell me where to sit   really   theres only one table occupied   there was a small area with two sofas for the chill crowd  both sofas were occupied and i didnt want to sit in an uptight table alone  so  i sat outside on the patio   the food was good  but it was expensive for the portion you get  the coffee was luke warm   too expensive and no communal feel   im still waiting for a cool coffeehouse to make its way downtown   the beat it still the best going and publicus loves itself more that this place does 
if you read my other three reviews of coffee houses in the downtown area you will understand why i was dubious trying the new vesta coffee house  well  they got everything right    the atmosphere is unpretentious and modern  the staff is pleasant and happy  the prices are fair  the food i had was yummy  the coffee is very good  and  yes  believe it of not  they allow you to add the sweetener yourself   there was none of that  we can do it better than you  attitude like at publicus or that  we tell you where to sit  shtick you get at makers and finders    there are two things that would make vesta even better  a social loungy area and evening hours 
kind of place where you get food to go  and once you get home  you realize its trash  and now youre starving with nothing else to eat  disappointed
just had to add that we picked up a tray of their tiramisu     holy  cow   pure heaven   honestly  we ended up licking the tray    
i was amazed by ranch market   the produce selection was picture worthy and the prices were really  really cheap   the every day price for mangos  2   1  persimmons   5   1   etc   the meat department has every possible cut of meat and the prices were  sale  priced   the marinated beef chuck was crazy good   while youre there   before you shop  you need to stop by the agua fresca bar  about 8 diff flavors  and the restaurant indoors has some of the best carnitas i have had in a long time   my 16yo son actually filmed the place to send out to some of his friends 
 this review is for the browns peak   my husband and i are pretty experienced hikers and we loved this hike  i think this might even fall into the  2 spot  1st being s  kaibab  bright angel  3rd being flat iron   half of the hike is a gradual incline and easy to do  the other half is a mixture of boulder  rock scrabbling and rock climbing  using hand  foot holds   the temps were about 15 20 degrees cooler than the valley  some things to know before you go  1  the dirt road to the trailhead took us about 45 min in an off road vehicle 2  take a screen shot of a hiking blogs route   there were areas where we werent sure which way to go and had no cell service 3  the scree shoot is much more intense than flat iron or picket post  doable for those that are athletic and have some scrabbling  climbing experience  4  at the top  keep track of where you came up  we encountered two hikers who were completely lost  had tried hiking down but went the wrong way and were seriously considering the need for a rescue 5  bees  there were lots of bees  if you have an allergy  i would not hike this trail  about 30  of the time your shoulders are rubbing bushes on the sides of the trail that are covered with bees  they were plentiful in the am  less so in the pm  6  dont hike to the amethyst mine  there is nothing to see and the trail is really overgrown  lots of scrapes  cuts on legs and arms  
i had the pleasure of having a custom sign fabricated by royal signs  wow  let me tell you  what a vip experience  i have had some pretty lousy experiences with other sign companies in the past and dane was top notch from start to finish  if anyone in the phonic area is considering signage  look no further  im not sure whats more important  product  or customer service  let me assure you it doesnt matter because both a  with royal signs  i couldnt be happier with the finished product   thanks dane and the rest of the royal sign family 
stopped in after reading the other yelp reviews  nice easy location with lots of parking  it was around 8 30 on a friday night  they let us pick a seat and got our drink order right away  we ordered the pesto pasta and baked eggplant parmigiana  they brought us out some rolls that were ok  and when our food arrived and i asked for parmesan i was shocked that he turned around to the table behind us and grabbed a bottle of parmesan  like you would see at a pizza joint  i would have expected an italian restaurant owned by italians they would have fresh grated parmesan   the portions were nice  the food was hot  my eggplant was extremely soggy and mushy with way to much mozzarella cheese so i did not eat much  the side of pasta was good and my husbands pesto pasta was good  the service was good  but could have been better 
one of the cleanest  most friendliest mcdonalds i have ever visited  wish they could all be this nice  food was hot and fresh 
we visited for an early lunch  service and food was delicious  portions are just right  its a bit overpriced but i would definitely keep this one my list of italian places i would visit again 
 30 for 2 wontons  shrimp and scallops and their hand pull noodles  flavorless and not worth it at all  i also try their tan tan noodle and it has the most weirdest after taste  the whole bowl of noodle was cover in chili oil  which i expect already since its tan tan noodle but the meat was little to none  the noodle was suppose to be their hand pull noodle as well but i would rather they serve us the generic one for half the cost  overall its pricy not worth it  i could have spend less at mcdonalds and actually gotten full 
i literally have to utilize all self control each time i drive by fiesta  definitely one of my favorite spots to drive through and get lunch during a busy day  i get a  2 and a bean and cheese burrito and obviously extra sides of the red sauce  so good 
absolutely love this spot amazing food specialties and drinks ive never tried before the oyster selection was great  the french toast and caviar with cream sauce was beyond my expectations and the fried oysters on deviled eggs i couldnt be happier with this place  one of my favorite vegas spots
normally when i am in vegas  steak house isnt something thats normally on the menu  its always buffet  buffet  buffet  but my most recent vegas trip was just different then usual routine    this place was suggested to us by a friends former coworker  and i would like to thank him  i love this place now  friendly staff greeted at the door  after being seated  warm bread is served in a pan  so cute    the beau and i wasnt all that hungry  so we decided to get 1 appetizer and main course to share  always a good idea to share when you are not all that hungry  we dont want any good steak to go to waste    for appetizer we had truffles mac and cheese  omg  it was delicious  thank you fellow yelper for the awesome suggestion  none of it went to waste  every little bit of it was taken care of by my tummy   as for the main course  we shared wollensky steak  very yum  it came with 6 pieces of thickly sliced steak with a little sauce on the side  crab  big pieces of crab meat  salad served on a sea shell  and some steam veggies lined up in the center  very yum  and just enough for 2 people who are not so hungry to share   customer service was a plus  very nice and knowledgeable staff  had a lot of suggestions for us  since it was our first time there    for those who ate steak during the meal  they actually bring out a different type of knife for you to use  it was nice and shiny  and for sure very sharp  i need one of those at home  ha ha    i will most definitely go back and dine there again  hopefully soon    
i worked at starbucks for 4 years so its needless to say im a little picky     but i always get literal perfect service here i love the staff   
great people   awesome hospital   state of the art medical care   the facility is top notch 
just stopped by this place today after working out this morning  decided on a whim to get a pedicure and i was pleasantly surprised   this place is clean and they got me in pretty quick  my pedicure ended up costing  37  before tip  and included a very through leg massage  callus removal  sugar scrub and neck massage   very swanky   for what i paid  i feel like i got more than what you normally get at a nail salon 
i heard about this medical practice because its right by my work and its where my father goes  ive been here twice now and i love my doctor  shes very kind and professional and walks you through the exams so you dont feel uncomfortable  theyre very good about getting you in same day in case you need an appt asap  their entire staff is friendly  i would recommend this practice to any and all my friends  the only thing is that they charge a  60 administrative fee that theyre very clear about on their website and up front on your first visit  this fee accounts for paperwork and the convenience of being able to schedule same day appointments  several people from my work also go to this practice and have nothing but nice things to say about it  dont let  60 dissuade you from amazing health care 
so you think you can dance     topless edition       wouldnt recommend this to my worse enemy      minimal acrobatics  loud fake orgasms  and tacky male glitter g strings     im still trying to figure out what the purpose of that goat man was     there was no central theme or story line      snoozefest the only saving grace was the flying midget
great breakfast  the tiramisu pancakes were life changing  cute retro decor  the root vegetables hash was also delicious  a cheery way to start the morning  
wow  i cant believe they deleted my review  i think they dont want people to know how disgusting this place is  trust me people  they come off as nice but when you sign that lease and start living there  they pretty much dont care for you afterwards  i remember their were so many people who put there complaints and now they are no longer on here  its your choice people  they would show you a model home first  but they would not show the actual unit  roaches everywhere  cracks everywhere  most appliances broken  black mold in the shower room growing  had a hole in my ceiling for almost two weeks because of a water damage from up stairs  to much problems 
the cheesecake factory was very overpriced for what i is served   it was a disappointment but i guess you cant expect much out of a big chain corp 
excellent pho    wish they had some shrimp springroll with the rice paper   but everything said amazing pho i was really suprised by the food quality  meat was good   i recommend  
a cool place to get a beer  right on the lake   the food is marginal at best   drink specials daily   as of recently they have added a lot of microbrews to their selection   may make it a 4 star  but not convinced yet 
genius   the perfect restaurant for the area   great quick food at reasonable prices   i love the fact that they have avocado quinoa bowls now too  a great way to put something healthy on your stomach before i night out drinking   im not gonna lie  i havnt been a fan of cabo fish taco for quite some time   the quality has fallen off a little  while wait is longer and longer   so having another spot to get tacos is more than welcome   dont get me wrong  i will still go to jack beagles for a wrap or mac and cheese  ill still go to growlers for some apps  and ill still go to boudreauxs or the public house for a more sit down experience   but all that said  this place serves a niche that has been needed to be filled for quite some time   i guess i should talk more about the food and booze   i started writing this assuming everyone had been to the other location   this restaurant is part of the 3 amigos and salud beer shop family   anybody looking for basic mexican food should be able to find something to make their heart content  but there is so much more   think more central and south american street food   arepas  gorditas  empanadas  as well as your basic tacos and burritos   everything is good and reasonably priced   on top of all this  they have a great beer selection   i mean really great  like probably better than any other mexican restaurant in nc   stone  ballast point  and tons of local beers   ill be back  many times over and over 
so i got lucky enough to try out their new veggie  locally sourced  healthy eating  save the world  menu  simply amazing  it felt so good to actually have eaten a true vegetarian meal  everything they offered was flavorful  but i find myself still dreaming about the carrot salad  it was lightly seasoned with  maybe  cinnamon or cardamom  the cucumber dill salad and the bulgar wheat lentil loaf were yummy too  the catch  right now they only offer two or three of the 10 12 items for lunch  so the offerings change daily  check their facebook page for the days plate   and  wrapping this up in grand fashion  the veggie plate of the day costs  5 6  sustainable for the planet and your wallet 
awesome bbq     loved their smoked sausage   didnt like their chicken   their pork is amazing   just stay away from the chicken 
the gobernator is the best fish taco ive ever eaten   dont get just one  youll be back in line for more 
the duck poutine is amazing   excellent beer selection too   unfortunately service is  just okay   staff seem friendly but distracted  dont know their menu well enough to give advice on gluten free options  but decent advice for beer selections  we had to wait quite a while for service when we went with a group  of 6  sitting at a table  got much better service when i we went as a couple and sat at the bar  even though it was busier and during a jays game 
we were on our way from md to hilton head  i have made it a point to visit bbq on road trips  the reason we chose billss was because it all homemade and the unique yellow slaw  mustard   vinegar base   for us  to experience authentic nc pulled pork bbq  they cook the whole pig   with the yellow slaw combo was the best part  followed by the amazing banana pudding  which is a must  bills is as close to walking back in time as anyone can hope for  expect fast pace  plastic cups and lots of napkins 
service was slow and the workers had no enthusiasm  me and my mom stood in line behind a huge family that took at least 10 15 minutes and the manager saw us and didnt even say we will be right with you or anything  he wasnt even saying anything to his crew  im a manager at a restaurant and ive worked at an ice cream shop and theres always communication or acknowledgment to the guests  the cashier said maybe one word and i dont even know what she said  its sad thats the only creamistry near me and i live in mesa  i go back to california a few times a year and theres one in palms springs and that is the best location  id rather wait till i go to california then just drive 30 minutes for that awesome ice cream  horrible workers but the best dang ice cream ever made  i wont be going back to that location  there needs to be more locations in gilbert  chandler  mesa or even tempe  and only hire people that are super bubbly 
go for the kitsch factor  take a coat  pay the cheapest entry price  have one drink and jet  they dont let you take your cell phones in to take pics but paying for the professional photo option isnt worth it 
a disappointment  the other reviews led me to set my expectations higher than i normally would for a buffet   bad move  this is a step above golden corral but not worth the price  just go to a real restaurant 
excellent place for breakfast in phoenix  located on a farm  complete with farmers market  animals  scenery   you can walk around while you wait for breakfast    start with a bloody mary they make great ones here   seating is outside and so refreshing  opted for huevos rancheros here and it was great   ambiance and change of scenery is the best part about this place 
great no frills sushi place with friendly staff 
i looooooove this place    it has the most unique flavors and the best toppings  love the    boba  
i would eat here for breakfast every day if i could afford it  fresh ingredients  creative recipes  and great service  we have been waiting 20 years for a breakfast place like this in south chandler  so happy that first watch is here 
stopped in for the first time today and really enjoyed my salmon and brown rice bowl  the portions were decent and everything seemed very fresh  they did not have shrimp yet  which would have been my first choice  but im looking forward to trying it another time   i work in that center and the price  base of  9 95  is too steep to go for lunch often  but its nice to have another option around 
worst customer service ever  we waited 20 minutes  watching 3 stylists play on their phones while another stylist worked on the only other customer there  i get it  we were a walkin and youre waiting for appointments  but when a half hour passed and we were still watching you play on your phones  it got a little uncomfortable  its a shame  because im a really good tipper  well stick with going to taylor at the ray rd  location 
i first went to chatime late summer  early fall when it was brand new and not fully set up yet  it was a sweltering day and unbearably warm inside  frankly  it didnt look all that impressive   the bubble tea definitely changed my mind though  i love their selection of flavours  good old classics along with more interesting varieties we dont normally get in toronto tea shops   im tired of endless lists of fruity bubble teas where you really dont taste the tea   i like that you can really customise your drink  i often opt for less sugar and less ice  ive since been back several times  and their finished interior is quite nice as well  you would never know it was once in the unfinished state i saw it in  this is definitely one of the best bubble tea places downtown  in my opinion 
the only reason top sushi really prospers is for the same reason many of the eating places around college and st  george prosper  students on a schedule and on a budget   i admit i fully contribute to this and have been here several times  just like other restaurants in the area  this isnt the kind of place you go to for a nice dinner with friends  their food is standard mediocre toronto sushi restaurant quality    theyve got your basic sushi and most of it is     all right  their soup udon dishes are comparable to what i make at home  except the udon noodles arent chewy enough   service is similarly bland  i dont have high expectations of these kinds of sushi restaurants in the first place  but it always irks me when paying by debit or credit card requires you to go up to the front and pay  especially around the lunch hour when there are a lot of students ordering take out  it crowds the cash register area   good for an hours lunch break for a busy student  not for much else 
i am writing this 2nd review because i am so disappointed with one nevada mortgage center   i received a loan doc to review and sign   if my calculations are correct  i am being overcharge for approximately  4 000 in closing for  130 000 loan with 0 points   my closing costs  loan costs and other costs  came to  5 905 69   there were charge for home warranty which i already paid for   transaction fee of  3 500   there was an agreement with my realtor that my realtor has agreed to pay for buyer transaction fee of  775   i am putting over 50  down payment   one nevada credit union still required appraisal  which other loan companies dont require   if you are going to get a loan from one nevada mortgage center  be very careful   they should pay me back on some of the loan origination fee for the quality their work   i should not have to spend so much time reviewing all the detailed cost items    since my 1st review from 10  11  2016 was removed  i am including the review below   worst home loan experience   i could not get a commitment on loan closure date   they claim a large volume of loans for excuse   they were very poor in responding to e mails or phone messages   i had to write to the management  never got response from management   my realtor had to extend my escrow closure date   i had multiple home purchase and refinance loans   the worst experience 
subsequently spoke with another manager who professionally and kindly resolved the issue  we took her invitation to return         and we did    a   the level of professional service from javed and nazmul was subtle and sublime  all courses  especially the corn and tomato gazpacho  duck confit and cod three ways were perfectly prepared   needless to say  the 360 views on a crystal clear day were spectacular 
what a gem  everything we ate was fresh  flavorful and reasonably priced   our server was personable without being invasive or interrupting the meal   highly recommend the red pepper and walnut dip as well as the tabbouleh  great for a date or a night out with friends  would highly recommend if you are in the area 
i came here for a summerlicious lunch this year  and i have to say that i was pretty disappointed  both my friend and i ordered the cucumber gazpacho to start  which she aptly described as  a facial in a bowl   it had this strange   unique   flavour which wasnt necessarily bad   but it wasnt good  either  the strange gazpacho was followed by a mushroom papardelle which was actually quite good   i would say it was the highlight of my meal  with a creamy  flavourful sauce and fresh ribbons of delicious pasta  for dessert i had the  bld bread pudding   which turned out to be not like authentic bread pudding at all and more like two slices of dry bread sitting on top of a puddle of creme anglaise    service was quite brusque  and there were obvious dirty fingerprints all over my plates   mysteriously  it was only after i whipped out my credit card to pay for lunch that our server suddenly became all amicable  this might be sad to say  but for  20 i would have rather had a burrito and a beer for lunch 
ive been here twice now  and i have to say that ive been pretty content both times  in yelp terminology   a ok   although  i must admit that one of the selling points of this place is its prime location    the first time i was here was for a birthday gathering with a handful of close friends  i ordered the  wise resolution  cocktail and the butternut squash ravioli  service was friendly but pretty slow  and the food wasnt that memorable  i should mention  however  that i brought in cupcakes and they were really great about bringing out plates and cutlery so we could eat them    more recently  i was here was for a work dinner with my team  we requested a private table and ended up sitting in this long booth behind the host area  its an interesting concept  but we had to keep passing things down the table which was a bit annoying  to start  we ordered some bruschetta  spring rolls  and shrimp for the table  i had the margharita pizza as my main  once again  the food was fine  but nothing blew me away  drinks were good   i had a regular manhattan in lieu of the o b version  the combination of vanilla and liquor makes me want to gag   as well as a glass of wine  j  lohr  and some custom made pineapple cocktail  our server was friendly and a strong upseller  always making suggestions  but not extremely attentive  which i think could be partly attributed to how busy this place is   all the time  reservations are strongly recommended   the space is modern and clean  but it can get really loud  which makes intimate conversations difficult  i would say its a decent choice for groups  because the menu has such a wide variety of options  ranging from curry to pizza to steak  that theres likely to be something for everybody 
i came to bakerbots with my boyfriend a few weekends ago specifically to get a sweet treat to enjoy with our coffees  walking in  i was immediately enchanted by the sweet displays of cakes and cookies  unfortunately  i completely agree with amy d s review    we werent greeted very warmly  and although it was obvious we were first time customers  there were no real offers of assistance   suddenly uncomfortable and consumed with a desire to get out of there as quickly as possible  i ended up hastily choosing a  rococo  cookie    a chocolate cookie with a hint of sea salt  at least  thats what im assuming it was  as the owner didnt bother to explain what any of the cookies were   the cookie itself was fine  it tasted as i would like a chocolate cookie to taste  but it wasnt really worth going out of the way for  my boyfriend had some sort of croissant sandwich and a slice of apple pie  which i personally didnt enjoy    just as we were about to leave  another customer walked in    a regular or a family friend  im assuming    and rosannes demeanour changed immediately  giving him a warm smile and telling him that he could pay later if he didnt have cash on him  i was actually kind of shocked   it was like witnessing dr  jekyll and mr  hyde  reading through others reviews  its obvious that  some  people do get this kind treatment  however i would hope that all paying customers are considered equally as important  and treated as such   also  avoid the rude  literally  a cold  cash only    awakening a customer in front of me had and come prepared to pay cash only 
ive lowered my rating because this place has jacked their prices way up  its now too expensive to take our family here for sunday brunch as my daughter is now considered an adult with the adult prices being raised and the kids price has also gone way up  what used to cost us around  80 for the four of us would now be about  140  thats quite a price increase  combined with the age changes  which we werent aware of until we paid one day and found our bill much higher   this place probably makes a killing on taking desperate peoples money out in the casino  why the need to gouge at the buffet   it used to be a good value  but i cant say it is any longer at these prices  why is an 11 year old an adult now      sad probably wont be back anytime soon unless some rich relative we dont know dies and leaves us money in their will 
since my original review  i have eaten at pita cafe several more times  i must say  im not as impressed as i used to be  i feel like their gyros have changed   less meat  shredded iceberg lettuce  lower quality overall  ive also tried several more things on the menu and have not been impressed  i dont like their rice at all  their menu is quite limited  no salmon   and when i ordered the vegetable platter  it was mostly dolmathes  weve grown tired of pita cafe already  but its still a good deal for their  5 gyros  i didnt like the chicken gyro at all  though  super dry and tasteless 
what can i say except these guys are the best  i emailed ivan on a tues i believe   he provided a timely quote for a setup of 3 items  bed frame  tv stand and night stand   the assembler nikolai came on time that same saturday and worked late into the evening setting everything up without complaint  he was extremely polite and helpful  packed up all the discarded cardboard in an easy to dispose of manner   clean and just did an amazing job  i will use these guys all day every day 
amazing team    great hair by demi and anthony    i would highly recommend for great color and cut   
love this place  i have not had one thing that i didnt like  favorites are the cauliflower gratinata  beet salad  pesto chiatarra  service is great and they can usually get you in and out for a quick weekday lunch 
i really dont want anyone to know about this gem in the southwest area   seriously thought  this sushi is amazing   the happy hour prices cant be beaten   everyone here is super friendly  too 
wonderful dining experience  meat cooked to perfection  and loved the french bread  will definitely be going back 
great service   sal did a very professional job on a small problem i had with my sprinkler system   i got a return call from him in less than an hour and he fixed the problem the next day as he had to get a part   will give them a call the next time i need repair work done at my home 
great food  great people  i think i will bring the family here  servers are very courteous
lian pu is decently priced yummy chinese  some people are fans and others are skeptical  well it is a popular place for many chinese students and has sizeable portions at decent prices    now quality of  food is standard quality but that more greasy goodness we all need occasionally  however  some of their dishes can be lighter and boast some of those home comfort feels  like their chicken and egg noodle soup    its also great if you want to get more traditional chinese dishes  such as beef intestine  yes  they have that  but if you want to get the more popular chinese dishes they have that too  mabo tofu is really good  nice and spicy yet light tofu  new favorite may be the beef ho fun which is so nice for the fried noodle cravings    also  they serve bubble tea  the bubble tea is yummy  downstairs they have hot pot and little grills if anyone is thinking of a more all you can eat type experience 
i needed a makeup artist and hairstylist for my upcoming wedding this november and was so glad my friend recommended courtney  she was reasonably priced and was eager to share albums of hair styles and makeup she did on previous clients  i was so happy to schedule my trial run and in the end  she did an amazing job  courtney listened to what i wanted and it all turned out perfect  i cant wait for the big day 
i thought we could move our piano ourself  but found out late saturday afternoon that we could not   with everywhere closed sunday  and having to be out of the house by midnight on monday  i began to feel extremely stressed   that is  until i spoke to jim with max piano moving   within 3 hours he was at my door in north phoenix picking up my piano   and he was affordable     although i had gotten myself into a mess  jim didnt take advantage of the situation  he had my piano in his truck in a few minutes and delivered shortly thereafter   i hope everyone uses this company   they are the best   
great little place   lived here my whole life and have never been   love the food 
i was referred to this law firm because of a motor vehicle accident i was in  when i called the lady who answered was so rude  after talking to her for a while  giving her my details i scheduled an appointment  once i got off the phone i realized when you retain a lawyer you generally work with their office staff and paralegals more than the actual lawyer and she was so rude i would rather not have to deal with her  i called back and cancelled because i cant believe anyone would allow someone to be so disrespectful  its a shame i was hoping since he came from another lawyers referral it would be a good experience 
great korean food  brings back great memories of my time in korea  the tofu soup is so good with plenty of vegetables and tofu  the bibimbap is great too  all with fresh veggies  we ordered the regular spicy which to me is equal to mild  medium  so if you like it hot make sure you try the one above it   service was great and prices made us smile  this place rocks  will definitely come back again 
i used to love this place but since the new comp system my gold card is absolutely useless  i asked for a  15 comp to get my best friend a birthday round but was told no  the host was not interested at all in being friendly and i talked to myself the whole time  he never gave a peep  player rewards girl was very rude  the only good service ive had is the bartenders and floor servers  they keep the place going  ill be taking my business elsewhere  my dollars obviously mean nothing to this place 
showstoppers is a fantastic show  we enjoyed every minute of it  the music  the dancing and the actors are all wonderful  the only negative point is that the seats are very small  we are not big people but we were really squished together  the stage and theater are so beautiful but its a shame the seats are tiny  there is not a bad view in the theater except maybe the back 5 rows  the middle section of the theater was completely full but the organizers could make their guests much more comfortable if they would have spread us out   they actually moved people to the middle section from the sides    the show itself is exceptional  there are 6 lead singers who carry the show with a huge group of backup singers and dancers helping out  you really feel like you went to a broadway show  the costumes and sets are beautiful 
perhaps the most striking thing about this partcular centrally located bar is its decor  scattered with wall art and sculpture  and with a fresh funky lighting set up  its no surprise that oddfellows is one of the most up and coming bars to start a night out  i have been on two occasions  once when it was quite and you could meander around the nassive wooden beer hall style tables to either of the two ground floor bars  and once when it was packed out  but with its fun music and reasonably priced drinks  it is definately worth checking out  take note of the incredible horse light 
went in to get my car serviced   save your time and never go there   i was told it would take 2 hrs and the work took over 3 hrs   nothing additional was performed   just slow service     more importantly i was treated terribly   the service tech had no customer service skills and was rude and not knowledgeable throughout the process     the day after i took my vehicle to rohrich a light came on in my car due to not having enough air in the tires   i expect the service department to check the pressure in my tires during a 3 hours oil change appointment   dont go there for service
if youre a vegetarian do not eat here  this place really is not worth the money at all  the sushi bar is really misleading  literally only offers 3 options  mac   cheese  puhleassee thats melted cheese on pasta   skip this place and eat mcdonalds
caitlin the bartender was amazing  i had to keep ordering milkshakes from her togo and she was absolutely wonderful making them with a smile  her service was wonderful  and she smiled and helped me the whole time she is an asset to your bar     will be back soon 
the dj  my review is about the dj  he played a mix of everything  old school soul  and new day rap  the music kept the crowd going and ppl dancing and or singing along  i didnt order an alcoholic beverage or a hookah and still enjoyed my time because the music had me on my feet of reliving memories through song 
i have been craving jamaican food for about 4 months     being a native new yorker  i knew i wasnt going to eating the best jamaican food  at this restaurant  but iam optimistic and id thought i would give tasty island a try      i ordered  a small curry goat which comes with rice and peas   cabbage and a plantain  i also ordered a side order of jerk chicken  to  satisfy my long yearning for jamaican food      at first glance the jerk chicken didnt look appealing and my first bite confirmed that  is wasnt good    the jerk chicken is soft and moist but the seasoning isnt there  it taste as if the chef bought a bottle of jerk marinade they sell at vons  heated up some chicken and threw it on top  the curry chicken looked good but once again no flavor   not seasoned well definitely not what i was expecting i closed my bag as soon as i tasted the food      the woman at the counter had a bit of an attitude but that is a right of passage when going to a jamaican restaurant  
i walk in to get seated  and it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to get our drink order   i ordered chicken wings   an hour later  no joke  literally an hour   the wings came out and i ate 4 of them  my friend told me to look down on my plate  as i look down  it looked like the chicken had been murdered  yes  they were bloody and raw  im not saying i wasnt a dumb    for not looking at chicken while i eat it  but damn  i told the waitress and she took them off the bill  a small compensation for what ensued later that night  about 5 hours later  i get home from work  and i start crapping and puking simultaneiously  this went on for 8 hours  i called the doctor to see if im going to die  he said possibly    and to keep slamming water  so i did  i kept myself awake out of fear of death in my sleep by dehydration  so all in all  if youre looking to lose some lbs by crapping out your intestines and other non important organs  turf is the place to be 
highway robbery  i called them out for a leaky kitchen sink  nearly  400 and they did nothing  the sink still leaks  they wanted  1400 to replace a  150 garbage disposal and swap  12 sink pipes  do not use them they are rip off artists  they sent a  melvin  
great location and the staff had been pleasant  there was a convention that booked a fair number of rooms and i knew of this ahead of time  so i understand that they were a little pressed all around   only complaint was a security deposit that i wasnt informed of anywhere prior to arrival  i received several emails for check in  total fees  etc  not a single line anywhere about a mandatory security deposit  i have stayed in several hilton hotels in the states without any security deposit  or when there was one from other hotels  i was given advance notice  so to be met with a fee i couldnt necessarily cover in a different country was frightening    is it really that difficult to mention it ahead of time so your guests can plan around it 
kyras amazing  my eye lashes look fabulous  what a difference it makes in my eyes  i had next to no eye lashes and kyra did a full set  amazingly beautiful   thank you kyra      bonnie
as usual  steve wynn delivers  our room was gorgeous  the staff was incredibly helpful and the casino is as good as it gets  id give it 6 stars if i could  as a side note for the alcoholics among us  the free drinks were plentiful and they were with top shelf booze 
this preschool feels like a diamond in the world of pebbles   i am not sure where to begin    i love that my daughter is known by many people in the school  not just her teacher   staff know her by name  greet her and show genuine care for her   her teacher is easy to talk to and keeps me informed about how she is doing and any concerns she sees    a huge perk is that i get a discounted tuition by aiding in any classroom twice a month   if i aide more than twice i am able to save even more on tuition   i like being on campus to know what is happening in my daughters school   and  the preschool has daycare on site in case we decide to have more children   along with the teacher  each classroom has two parent aides  so the kids get an abundance of attention   in case youre wondering  all parent aides have to be fingerprinted  go through a brief training  and have a background check before aiding   im pretty particular about details and want to know who is working with my child     i know this might sound crazy  but i really like the gate the school has around their entire campus   kids are not able to open the gates without help from adults   my kid is pretty darn crafty and those gates make me feel more secure  i feel pretty darn lucky to have found this school in my own area of phoenix   i recommend you go to the school for a tour to see the school in action 
we spent an unexpected night in charlotte and had to walk here from the embassy suites to pick up some toiletries because the embassy suites store sucked   i guess that should probably be mentioned on another review   well aside from the fact that there are apparently no sidewalks in charlotte  this cvs is well stocked with your standard drugstore stuff   their travel size department was a bit lacking  and the checkout was slow  but all in all if you need toothpaste  or a pair of cheap sandals these guys have it 
i had a decent breakfast burrito here very late night   the service was kind of slow  but it hit the spot 
i went there recently for my birthday  best sushi ive had in las vegas by far  ive traveled to japan many times  mostly the tokyo and yokohama areas  and ive eaten sushi at some of the best restuarants there  i have to say  without a doubt  that this is as close to authentic sushi as i have found  and  as it turns out  the sushi master is from japan  the service was excellent as well  i never had to call for service  as the waitress was very attentive  they also have the american style rolls as well  it was the best birthday ive had in my 53 years 
one of my favorite steakhouses in scottsdale   world class salad bar  plethora of wine options   meats perfectly cooked to my preference   attentive staff  multiple points of contact throughout my dining experience   chocolate molten cake with ice cream  was the cherry on top 
paid  20 for lunch today   the food was horrid    meat was dry as a bone  corn tortilla was hard and old   i dont generally complain or return food  so it was immediately discarded   instead had chinese food nearby  wich explains the  20 lunch bill 
tried their mac and cheese at the arizona freestyle festival   i could tell it would have been good had the pasta not been overcooked   the real problem was the beans and rice with chicken and sausage my sister ordered  two pieces of sausage and no chicken   the person behind the window was rude when questioned     im pretty sure they were overwhelmed with the amount of people  maybe even trying to stretch the food out by skimping on portions  the concert obviously didnt book enough food vendors  buzznbeez eventually ran out of several items an supplies    there was 4 of us  only 1 of the four of was happy with our meals   that person was really happy with the fish sandwich and made several comments about how good it was  considering how rude the woman at the window was to my sister i wouldnt have enjoyed anything from this truck   would i ever eat at this truck again  absolutely not 
i ate here for the second time in the past year  i had fried tofu and asparagus rolls the first time  it was fine  the tofu was battered then fired  i preferred it without the batter  second visit i had a salmon skin roll  omg so yummy  i also had mozzarella and jalapeno wrapped in seaweed and deep fried in tempura    i wasnt sure of the seaweed and cheese combo  it was very tasty   ive already decide on my next meal there  im having the salmon skin roll with miso soup and salad  my niece had a combo plate  she was happy with her meal as well  it was a lot of food  another great thing about this eatery they dont use styrofoam takeout containers 
well     ive returned twice since my previous review and both times were pretty terrible  i cant be sure whether my original experience or the last two were flooks  on my second visit  they were  out  of many food choices  forgivable but still pretty strange for a professional restraunt  what wasnt forgivable was both the coffee and food i ordered was cold when it got to the table  when it came back  it was hot  but so burningly so i figured they must use a microwave which explained why my food was tough in the center       our waitress was still very nice but i  and other members of my party  only got 1 refill of coffee during our entire visit and that was only because we asked  on the third  and most likely final  try their internet was down  cash only  not a huge deal  and definitely not their fault  but the hostess seemed annoyed when i asked if they take checks and pretty rudely just pointed to the bank across the street  our experience was bad enough the second time that we agreed not to bother and went to t c  eggintons instead  our breakfast there was delicious 
sullivan was the first place i went to shop for a jeep wrangler  it was also the place i ended up back at to purchase my first jeep  these guys are car guys  they know their vehicles inside and out and had an outstanding selection of new and used wranglers  they have jeep specific techs and are able to modify jeeps on their lot to meet your needs  i enjoyed working with my salesman  doug  doug is a really nice guy  very genuine  and was never  pushy   i would recommend working with him to anyone shopping for a car  the sales managers were professional  and again  are not just business  sales guys  but also car guys  i have a few minor details with my jeep to take back in and work out  that is the only reason it is a 4 star review  and not a 5  thanks for a great car buying experience sullivan motor company 
just left snooze  gilbert  after a brunch with the fam  whether your looking for a family breakfast  brunch  lunch or trying to cure a hangover  snooze aces it  the portions always satisfy  but arent so big that they weigh you down  breakfast tacos with bacon hit the spot today  all menu items i have had in the past are flavorful and well prepared  the peanut butter cup pancake is insane  counting calories aside  stuck with coffee today  but next time i need to continue to work my way through the am cocktail menu  always a good idea to hit snooze 
great 1st experience and coffee at black rock yesterday  my wife and i both had a skinny  caramal blondie chiller  hit the spot on another hot a   day in the valley  service at the counter was very friendly and fast  they had a bunch of people working which i imagine gives them some quality customer service and order times  we had our 1 5 year old with us and didnt feel too intrusive or loud  it is a nice  open space that is family friendly  i would say we were outnumbered though  as the crowd was mostly business  laptop savvy  it is great to have another solid coffee shop on the east side  oh  and they have a drive thru  huge bonus 
first of all  incredible name for a brewery   sweetheart  honey  i was just doing some research   the location is both good and bad  right off the 60 in a busy area  great  tucked into a strip with little signage  not so good  i guess in some ways this could be seen as a good thing though  more importantly  the beer is really good and the service is very friendly and on time  the bartenders are always willing to take the time to answer any questions you may have and carry on a conversation  all while making sure no one is going thirsty  i had a few ipas  the intergalactic and 480g  the 480g will be a go to on my next trip for sure  the best part of the visit may have been the meat candy  the menu is not extensive  but i get the impression what they do  they do well  this candied bacon was delicious on its own  and i believe can be served on a blt as well   
such a cool spot in old town  and one of the best burger experiences i have had  we waited about 40 minutes during prime time on a saturday night  we ended up sitting on the patio  table of 7  during an awesome az winter night  it is not a huge place  so i am guessing a wait is pretty common  i like the semi tiki theme and am kicking myself for not trying a mai tai or one of their cocktails  i went with a bottle of red stripe from there decent beer menu  my 5 star rating is all about the food  there were at least 8 10 burgers i considered ordering  i went with the spicy mac and cheese burger  mac  bacon  jalepenos  whats not to love  it was everything i thought it could be and more  everyone at the table had a burger  many varieties  and they were all a hit  big flavor  quality toppings  and solid fries on the side as well  when i get that burger craving  the hangover burger is the next one i am crossing off the list  thanks for the rehab 
i was spending 3500 a month getting my cars repaired and painted here   i had been doing business here for over 5 years until new ownership has taken over   now i feel like im always lied to about the correct pricing  the vehicles are never finished when promised and just overall bad customer service defitantly not near what it was with previous owner  i hate to give anyone a 2 star review but you guys deserve it 
this review is long over due  i was there months ago but i just made my yelp account and this is my very first review  i clicked on cowfish to review it months after being there  went out of my way  that alone speaks volumes  so let us rewind to december of 2012 when my boyfriend got a really fantastic job offer in charlotte  nc that would force us to relocate from massachusetts  after a lot of soul searching  i gave in to this venture and came to charlotte the weekend before christmas for a house hunting trip  i was prepared to hate it  i anticipated hating it  before we left  my boyfriend let me plan us our first date in charlotte so i made us reservations at cowfish  the menu was fantastic  not only was our food delicious  and beautiful to look at  but it was reasonably priced and there was so much to choose from  you cant make a mistake but there are pages and pages of really exciting food options  moreover the restaurant itself is really gorgeous and clean and such an appeasing atmosphere and their staff are all really nice and accommodating  usually there is always one drawback to a cool restaurant with good food but theyve really got it all going on  they really made charlotte look good to me  im glad that was my first impression  cowfish is now one of our more sentimental special occasion restaurants  we were back a few weeks ago to celebrate my boyfriends birthday  fried pickles and coconut batter onion rings  hello  lover 
for the amount of time it took to get our food  you would have thought everything would be super fresh and delicious  unfortunately  not the case  had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 40 minutes for our food  then 15 more minutes at the end of the meal to get our waiters attention so we could pay  probably could have walked out without them noticing  the food was average  and had it been quick and with great service might have warranted a better rating  but unfortunately nothing was stellar about this restaurant  i would not recommend 
this company is a joke  do not use bfs home warranty   my water heater is not producing hot water so i had a tech come out to try to fix it  they gave me an afternoon time window of when the technician should arrive  which ended up being 4 30 and the tech leaving at 6 which is way later than what i expected  the tech took two parts off and put two old and used parts onto my water heater and that still didnt make the water hot  the tech said they would have to come back another day with new parts so i would be without hot water   i was displeased with the incompetent workmanship and called to cancel my membership  the manager called me back and pretty much told me that i was wrong and that his tech only put one old temporary part until the new one arrive and said the other part was new  wrong    it was old and your tech said so  the manager  owner of the company was a dick and is clearly not a professional and doesnt care about customer service  oh and cancellation is a  50 fee  stay away from bfs   you have been warned 
the fish was tiny and i am not sure if it even was fish  they bulk up on fries and the service sucks 
this place is glorious as far as im concerned  they offer threading  waxing  facials  haircuts and a few other beauty treatments   ive been coming here for a couple years now  its a walk in joint and there are always several ladies working  so you rarely have to wait  i come here mostly to get my eyebrows threaded  for  3    but ive also gotten some waxing done and had a good experience   its cheap  the ladies know what theyre doing  and you get some cheesy bollywood tunage to ease the pain of threading  waxing  triple win 
oh ma gaw  just had one of the best meals ive ever had at mamakas   full disclosure  i didnt pay for anything  dont even know how much our meal cost  so this review is strictly about food and service    which were so flawless that beyonce would have to change her song to  somewhat flawed  actually    our server recommended the fix hellas for me  as i like lighter beers  and it was perfect  my family raved about their cocktails   my family and i had a six  course prix fixe meal   1  pita   four dips 2  cured swordfish   spanakopita 3  tomato  feta  cucumber salad 4  grilled lambchops with couscous salad   garlic fries 5  grilled octopus over a fava bean sauce 6  baklava   ice cream  the lamb was so goddamn juicy and delicious  the tomato  feta  cucumber salad was another favourite  there was enough food to feed a tdsb classroom  but we managed to finish most of it   service was really good    our server was knowledgeable  charming  and generally on point  there was also what sounded like greek house music playing in the restaurant  which made for good  but loud ish  vibes  walls are all white  giving it that santorini feel   so  so good though 
despite the fact that the name of this place means  underpants  in my fathertongue  i decided to check this place out   i saw a sign for the lunch specials and couldnt resist   for a sweet  6 95  i got the beef bulgogi lunch special  which includes  in addition to the beef bulgogi  salad  miso soup  four california rolls  noodles  rice and herbal tea  it was all delicious  except for the salad which was made up of soggy lettuce   i got curious about the noodles because they had a unique texture  so i asked the friendly waiter if they were made from wheat  rice or something else  he was utterly perplexed by the word  wheat   he came back a couple minutes later to tell me that they were made from potatoes  im not sure if thats accurate  but they were damn good  so i didnt really care  i just wouldnt recommend this place to anyone with dietary restrictions or allergies   otherwise  the tv was tuned into some weird korean reality show  and duran duran and other cheesy 80s music served as background music to a lovely meal  i dug it 
this place has so much potential to be a 4  star joint  but service and management have been so poor the couple times ive been here  that i feel generous even giving them a 3   last time  my aunt made a reservation for 8 of us  i got there early and no one seemed to know anything about it  they quickly threw a few tables together inside  when my aunt arrived  she reminded them that her reservation was for the patio  so again they sloppily threw some  dirty  tables together   anyway  we started off with some beers  sangria  and bruschetta  all of which were delish  our initial server seemed clueless  and then another server took over who was better    but there was little to no communication between the two of them  the second server took our dinner orders   luckily my family is awesome  so we managed to entertain ourselves for the 40  minutes that it took for our food to come out  another family  who had arrived at the same time as us  apologized to us on behalf of the restaurant  lol   as they had finished and paid for their meal while we were still waiting on ours   food finally came  and was delicious  i got the veal  vitello carciofo     it was cooked to perfection in a yummy sauce  everyone else enjoyed their meal as well   i wouldnt recommend coming here in a group larger than four  because it seems like theyre too disorganized for that  the food is really good    service and management are not 
four stars for what the place is   a walk in  fast food shawarma joint  im sure there is better middle eastern food out there in this lovely city  but i was pretty happy with the falafel wrap that i got  i walked out happier because the guy making our food was super nice  funny and charming  even the dude i was with said so   overall  i had a yummy  filling and affordable dinner thanks to ali babas  big up 
delicious flavours  filling portions  friendly service  and super reasonable prices here  theres not much to critique here   i came here for dinner in a group  and my colleagues really enjoyed their meals   from curry puffs  to massamun curry  to peanut stir fry  i ordered two appetizers  vegetarian fresh rolls and shrimp chips  and was really pleased with both as well  with a  non alcoholic  drink  my bill came to under  20    for a lovely  sit down dinner  how is that even possible   they also get bonus points for serving my ginger tea in a super cute elephant teapot that we all gushed over 
a colorful yet refined interior that is conveniently located in the lobby of aria  its my third time coming to julian serrano and even though there are a great amount of choices and restaurants to explore in las vegas  i always make this restaurant my must goto  wonderful selection of tapas that are delicious  the more people you go with the better it is as you can order varieties of tapas to try over a course of time with some sangria and finish the meal off with one of the best paella you will ever have  please keep in mind that the paella takes anywhere from 45 60min so please make sure its the first thing you order  i always go with the mixed paella which is my personal favorite with everything from seafood to chicken and spanish chorizo in it  the minimum order is two but might be a bit much for two if you have some tapas  the staff will tell you exactly how much you will need to order according to your number of parties and amount of tapas you order   service is top notch  the servers are very helpful and the managers were nice enough to take off the paella this time due to a 15minute delay which we really didnt mind 
the community is very big  the staff is always welcoming and nice  i do pay online and submit my request for work orders online and they always come as soon as they are available  ive had live here for the past 9 months and it is very comfy  of course crime has no boundaries and there is situations out of hand  but that happens everywhere   i am giving 5 stars for customer service  staff   maintenance   for community appearance  and for amenities 
being mid summers day  of course it was raining hard so i dripped into cafe andaluz for some reviving tapas  decor is great   loads of wonderful wrought iron  beautiful tiling and lovely ceramics  from the any 3 tapas menu i picked albondigas  pork meatballs in a spicy sauce  yum   pollo marinado  pieces of marinaded chicken with a chilli yogurt  also yum  and patatas bravas which were lovely and spicy if a little less crisp that i would have liked  my small glass of house wine was satisfyingly large and came with a glass of iced water  i will be back for a mid morning coffee sometime as the surroundings beat the nearby starbucks hands down   thoroughly recommend it 
hmm  i had heard that this place had good fish and chips so we went a few days ago  have to say we were disappointed  the chips were soggy and the fish not in the slightest crisp   not a patch on the tailend on leith walk   you cant beat proper fish and chips if well done but this didnt come close 
horrible  loud unruly guests  walls so thin you hear the obnoxious music they pipe in 24  7  no coffee maker in the room for 300 a night    really    had to go to the lobby to buy a 3 00 cup of coffee in the coffee shop where the line was 10 minutes   extra long lines to get into the elevators making for a 20 minute delay getting upstairs   unapologetic staff  pool party for opening night lasted til 4 am blasting music through the entire hotel    if you like guantanamo bay as a place to relax   this is your hotel   otherwise   stay far far away    oh  i was overcharged for a room and it took me 3 weeks to get to speak to someone to adjust the bill    on the plus side the staff is very nice 
my new favorite place  loved the sandwiches and you must try the pasta salad  loved my root beer float 
after popping in on three other nail salons  this one was able to accommodate walk ins  two of us at that   julia did a great job on my pedicure and the hot stone massage was worth the price  she also did a shellac manicure  both the manicure and the pedicure lasted for over two weeks   no chipping  no peeling  very impressive 
went here before mls cup 2010 at bmo  first off  the nachos are not big enough to feed 4 people and a small child  second  the food is small for the price no matter what you order  the place was packed with tfc and fc dallas supporters and our waitress did a good job on coming back to us  id go back again  if im in to and im headed to bmo 
this is our 4th year in a row coming to vegas for edc week in june  ive stayed at a few different hotels ranging from a suite at the formerly known ph towers  south point hotel  suite at treasure island  stratosphere and now mirage  id have to say that without a doubt the best overall experience ive had was at the mirage  i do think their rooms are a tiny bit over priced for the week we were there however  the hotel itself has nice amenities and we loved the pool  the do need more servers at the pools however   we tried most of the restaurants inside and the only one we did not like was the carnegie deli  the carnegie deli is a huge blemish on this hotel  they are very disorganized  slow and the foot options just dont all really make a lot of sense  we tried it last year and gave it another go this year and had almost identical bad experiences  as for the rest of the hotel the rest of the staff was always friendly and we had no problems    the beds in this hotel are down right amazing  i think we are going to order one of their pillow and comforter sets they sell in the hotel shop    our biggest complaint would be the night club  each night we returned to our hotel there were always some very unsavory individuals lurking about that had just left the club  one night a man was making very inappropriate gestures at my girlfriend making her very uncomfortable  other nights there were just people being really loud and obnoxious coming from there  making her and i both a bit uneasy  we would love to see a dance music based night club in there    great job mirage  i think we will be back 
first time staying here for lib was fantastic  jp at the front desk was wonderful    took really good care of me and my boyfriend  would stay here again specifically because of the wonderful service he provided us  thank you jp you were awesome   
great staff  i had some lower back pain and they did well listening and addressing the area of pain  i would go back 
what fantastic service   i was a little apprehensive about having someone else pick my groceries for me but the grocery guru did a fantastic job   everything was exactly what i would have chosen and better  highly recommend 
lemon and illumilatte macaroons were just ok  the cinnamon  rolls were more like a muffin and not worth it   unfortunately the coffee was very bitter and not prepared as ordered  the decor was the bright spot 
wifi has been much better   it is still very busy during the lunch hour  so i plan my lunches a little later  after 1pm  so ill miss the crowds 
this was our first time here  we missed out by not going there sooner  i love the great eclectic ambiance  the food was perfect  i really enjoyed their  living room  style dining chairs  so comfortable 
disappointed with the service  we came in  5 employees ignored us to seat us down  asked for soy sauce she said yaa we have  never got it  asked another lady and she ignored us  i was like what is going on here     wanted to leave right away but i couldnt cause she took for ever to get me the bill   wow   i usually  when i got the bill i got charged for two ice teas two thai ice teas one soft drink extra  all we ordered and got was ice teas wow keeps getting worst by the minute  i will never ever come back   im pissed  i
beware   you get what you pay for   i have ordered cables from them   a coaxle cable for my sub and 2 hdmi 3d cables for my projector and receiver that i installed behind the wall   the pin on the coaxle cable broke the first time i put in into my sub and i had to delicately drill it out and go down the street to radio shack and picked up one that wouldnt break   i bought a hi definition 3d projector for my basement theatre put them behind the drywall   i put in two in case one ever went bad    both cables are garbage   when i hooked the first one up the picture was terrible  letters were pixelated  and the it definitely wasnt the 1080 it was supposed to be   i contacted customer service and they told me they couldnt send me new cables since they were behind the wall and i couldnt get them out   these two cables cost a total of  38 and they cant send me new ones   terrible products terrible service  stay away 
exceptional service i came to the wrong goodyear service and they actually accepted the coupon from thanks
i really enjoyed my meal at sidecar  from the bread basket with housemade whipped butter to my main  everything was wonderful  i cant remember exactly what i ordered  i think it was some sort of gnocchi dish   but i remember asking if it could be made meatless and my request was accommodated graciously  the food came out hot and delicious and the serving size was just right  the service was impeccable   water glasses continuously topped up  more bread offered when our basket was done  quick  kind and completely courteous  the space inside was dimly lit and quite romantic  a lovely spot for a date  i would most definitely return and pay full price  but am completely tempted by the  25 prix fixe dinner option   plus  as an added bonus  i love the ease of being able to make a reservation online 
i was introduced to uber a few weeks ago  and was intrigued by its service offerings  a taxi at your door with the touch of a button  with no need to deal with the fare and tip at the end of your ride  a black car service whenever you want it  without a reservation  as someone who is terrified of driving around the city  and pretty terrible at hailing taxis off the street  these words were like music to my ears   on the evening of a brutal ice storm  which happened to coincide with my birthday dinner  i decided i would give uber a whirl and use the app to hail a taxi to the restaurant  i punched in the information in advance and the app gave me an estimated arrival time of approximately 10 minutes   great   i thought to myself   plenty of time   when i was ready to hail the taxi  i eagerly gave the app the green light   and was notified that there werent any taxis available  and to try again later  or to get a black car  so i waited a few minutes and tried again  and again  and again  to no avail  no taxis were coming my way  as the clock continued ticking  and my panic at being late for my reservation grew  i decided to try the black car service instead  somehow the markedly more expensive black car service worked  and i received a text message letting me know that my driver was en route and would be arriving in 9 minutes  so i went downstairs to wait  and received a text 10 minutes later than my driver was  arriving   no sign of a car anywhere  after waiting 5 more minutes  i ended up frantically running outside to hail a taxi off the road  after which i received a text from the driver saying he was lost and asking for directions   overall  the ordeal turned out to be more of an inconvenience than just hailing a taxi myself to begin with  the price estimate for a taxi on the app ended up being several dollars more than what i ended up paying  even with a generous tip  i dont understand why i got a text saying the driver was arriving when he was lost and didnt even know where he was going  i wish there were more taxis available  although given the weather  i suppose its understandable that it would be a busy night  not sure that i would trust this service again    its promised ease and reliability really failed to deliver 
hold the presses    triple chocolate brownie    this thing is a sight to behold  each portion is huge  rich  fudgy and amazing  topped with creamy chocolate ganache and speckled with crunchy bits of chocolate throughout  yes  it is every bit as good as it sounds    unfortunately  i also tried a chocolate croissant here which was terrible  the croissant had little of the butteriness or flakiness that makes croissants worth every calorie  i had two bites and didnt even want any more  dont be like me  skip the croissant and get two brownies instead    another small downside of this place is that   although their baked goods were fairly reasonable   some of their other items seem awfully pricy  i noticed a bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice selling for like   8 75  dont waste your money on orange juice  get three brownies instead 
the only times ive come here is usually before the drive back to la on sunday morning after you have checked out of your hotel which means you make it on time for their special  5 99 steak and eggs  place is usually busy during these times but its well worth waiting for the steak and eggs special  you can just go play  5 blackjack tables or watch sunday football during the nfl season if you need to wait  you get your steak which is decent and of course not the best but it will do  also comes with your choice of eggs  toast and potatoes  good combination and food for just  5 99  just typing this makes me hungry and craving for this the next time im in vegas 
i did order delivery   the delivery time was 20 min earlier than expected which was great   i was also very surprised by the fact that i was able to place the order within the yelp app   aside from those two facts  the food was delicious  the white rice was so aromatic  sticky and well cooked  the only thing that had me mark this place 4 instead of 5 stars was the sauce the dumplings came with  it did not agree with the flavor of the dumplings  the dumplings were soft  crispy and full of their own flavor  so they were enjoyable on their own  the curry was amazing  the consistency was perfect  no flavor overpowered any other flavor  i am very satisfied with the food  and i shall return once im done trying all the cuisine in the area 
first time to vegas and our friends  vegas residents   took us here after midnight and a night in the strip for their steak and eggs special  fabulous  huge portions and the steaks and eggs are cooked to order  and all for  4 95 a plate    unheard of in hawaii  yes  the restaurant was busy but our server was on it  bus persons kept soft drink and water glasses refilled without asking  one weird note  the menu says the special is only for those over 21  huh  my daughters 17 and taller than me  and  yes  she had the steak and eggs special  no problem 
confusing  is it rokerij  richardsons  or both  menus shared several dishes  came here at the recommendation of an arizonan primarily because i wanted to experience a prickly pear margarita before going back to hawaii  they had it but not blended  when i ordered it blended with salt  our server said  and this is a direct quote   we dont have a blender   seriously  had it on the rocks and it was just okay  not  10 okay  the food was eclectic and delicious  be aware when your server asks if she can start you with chips and salsa  and guacamole  one would think its a free standard at mexican restaurants  even fusion ones  nope  showed up as a  13 charge for a large guacamole    and the guacamole was awful  too salty  very little of it was eaten  the half price wine sundays and mondays advertised on their specials wall  not  at least not by the glass  showed up on the bill full price  i didnt dispute that or the chips  guacamole because a   it was our last night in arizona and b   my entree  the chimayo chicken  was fabulous  i liked the ambience of the place even though it was much darker than im accustomed to  my husband enjoyed his relleno platter and my daughter liked  not loved her  3 pizza 
five stars   more is what this office deserves  unbelievably amazing   there is not a single negative thing that comes to mind when i think of the visits made to dr  roles office   the care provided is excellent  he definetely knows what he is doing   what is best for each and every case that comes thru  since the first call i made to set up a consultation  ive been more than happy and thankful to each part of his team  great vibes  they make you feel like more than just another patient walking through the door  not only did dr  roles improve my back pain tremendously  he also guided me thru a better lifestyle nutrition wise  flipped my world upside right with all his help  thank you dr  roles  shanice  kyle    susie for everything  also has great masseur  carwin is great 
duh   amazing show  go see this legend before he is gone  tickets can get pricey for good seats   my advice is to check craigslist the day of or day before the show  good times   enjoy   
out of the gate i called for a reservation  they said no need   just come on in  so i was upset to find a 30 min wait for a table  they told me they dont take reservations  it vegas    sat night    you guys should take reservations  just my opinion   menu is small    food is over the top    truffle fries were incredible   everything else was good   not great   but good  i had good company which made the meal fun  so all in all we had a good time there  its a pretty good place  i guess i would return under the right circumstances    but wouldnt run back there on my own   
im a triathlete and ive tried many different sport massages  by far  katie gives the best massages  she is very aware of what areas need to be worked on and listens to what pressure you prefer  i did a full ironman three days ago and got a massage from her last night  today i wasnt sore or tight  which is amazing since i could barely walk yesterday before the massage  i cant recommend her enough  worth every penny 
the food was okay  good and service was great   the service made our okay meal a better experience  when my bf and i were first seated  we were asked if we were celebrating anything  we told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse bouche and sorbet dessert at the end   yay   truffle parmesan potato chips  freshly made and amazing in flavor  you can taste all the elements of this working well together  i thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated parmesan  the chips were thin  crispy and airy  i almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself    other   ribeye steak special  the special of the day was a petite rib eye with foie gras  the steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the foie gras  it was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference    ribeye  my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet  it was slightly seasoned more than mine  however when we reheated the leftover steaks  mine held up better and the foie gras melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one    mashed potatoes  just regular  nothing fancy 
a beautiful  sexy little place  i cant believe this little restaurant across from a frys shopping center looks like this    the food is decent but you can tell they try to be creative with it  they were a bit understaffed the two times we did go there    my only issue is that we were given a dining credit from our hotel and the waiter tried to tell us it was only good for  20 00 even though it was worth much more  i felt like i was in a bait and switch and had to go back and forth with him before he finally brought the chef  and owner im assuming   out to adjust it    i would go back again  just without any credits 
nice atmosphere  especially outside on a sunny afternoon  had the iced latte   tasted good  not a high quality roast though  and was larger than i expected which was a happy surprise  the wraps are fresh and nicely toasted once ordered  staff could use some training in how to be more personable  other than that  service was quick and would go back if in the area again 
made us wait even though there were empty tables  then asked us to squeeze a third party into our table  we had asked to be seated at the biergarten  less noisy and less crowded  but they ignored it  when asked about why we were not seated there even though more than half the biergarten was empty  the waitress blamed it on the hostess  and hostess vice versa  the food was ok  mediocre  not bad 
totally mediocre at best  we have tried it twice and its dry and laking in flavor  maybe if your order the vegan option  its ok but if you want big  bold flavor   try elsewhere  in a pizza town like this  we wont go back 
the perfect afterwork drink spot  the decor needs some refreshing and the menu wasnt particularly exciting  but thats not their area of expertise  the beer  im not even a beer drinker and i got excited by all the selection  the fries are a must  when in beerbistro     the service was really friendly and the atmosphere is casual  its a departure from the standard toronto financial district afterwork bar  and thank god for that 
eh  its okay  i was excited to hear about a new thai restaurant  hoping that i could get in before the 2 hour lines started  the service is good enough  the decor was acceptable  the food is fine  ill admit that the tum yum soup was quite tasty  but it wasnt so delicious that i have to go back again as soon as possible or ever again  if you get an opportunity to try it out  try it  if they tell you that theres a wait longer than your appetite can stand  go elsewhere  you wont be missing out on any musts 
one of the worst experiences at a restaurant  had a reservation for 10  however when we arrived  early  we were notified it would be some time as they just sat a table for 10  after a 30 min wait  why have a reservation if you are going to wait   we finally sat down  upon receiving our food  an hour later  all but one dish was completely cold   needless to say we will never be back to this location 
in n out is the best place to get a burger   the food is always great and the staff is friendly and nice to deal with   this is how fast food is meant to be done   best place to go every time 
this will be a short post  we went there for lunch  it was not busy  we were quickly seated  we sat outside at the table for 10 minutes watch the wait staff pass by but never talking to us  no one spoke to us  no water  nothing  we decided to leave  as we walked out the hostess that seated us 10 minutes earlier thanks us for coming  she did not remember seating us minutes earlier  it all turned out great because the second place we went to turned out to be awesome  i dont know how the food is at bq but the service is nonexistent 
dr  michael was able to see me the same day and provided excellent service  he did picture of my eye nerve and assured me everything is good with my eyes 
well below average with our order   hummus was pasty and the side of veggies were nasty   the mini carrots looked like the ones that fall in the bottom of my fridge 
one star because we cant give zero weve been in our room for over an hour with ac on at full blast and it must be 95 degrees at 2am   pool is oddly closed temporarily even though all looks fine  smells like stale smoke building is sadly outdated  dont fall for the low price tag this place is a dive very scary out front at night where local zombies walk up and down the boulder strip chanting brains  must get brains  if you have any brains you will spend more money elsewhere and  avoid this place like its the plague 
i started looking for mexican food restaurants in my new neighborhood and found what looked like a good bet   one that has a cozy dining room  friendly staff and great food   i tried the stack  with a house margarita   the margarita had to be really good for me to order a second one   the stack is on the happy hour menu with a whole lot of other tasty offerings   chips and salsa was fresh and great with the drink while waiting a short time for the stack to be cooked to order   everything is cooked from scratch  which is what i look for   looking over the reviews beforehand  i felt it would be a great choice because new owners came in and worked hard to turn secreto around  nearly all the not so great reviews were pretty much coming from the previous owner who must have lost heart in making it be the best it could be   theres a great difference in quality when the whole staff has their heart into it  doing everything they can to earn repeat business   im certainly going to be a repeat customer as the variety  cleanliness  cheerfulness makes secreto very special   now to catch as many of their specialties i can   enjoy 
over several years  i keep coming back to a1 studios because no matter how different the projects are  the results have always produced the intended results   one thing is having all the best equipment and talent which cliff has plenty of both   the deeper talent is in the editing process that produces a finished video that gets results   highly  highly recommend 
the jambalaya is incredible  very good taste  not very spicy if that is your thing you can kick it up with hot sauce  good local beer on tap and a friendly staff 
id like to point out that i am an ichiza fan  however  recently they have been declining in quality   i would also like to point out that recently  ichiza has a c rating on their cleanliness  their ratings are hidden behind the cash register  and it is a wonder why i did not enjoy their sushi so much 
the spa would not run after filling   i called to let them know   they told me i should call the manufacturer tech support as they would not be able to get the repairman back until the following week   i spent a half hour on the phone with tech support and ended up getting the spa running   the repairman failed to flip a switch on the circuit board   i am still struggling to get the front panel back on the spa and am very frustrated   when i called to report that i had to complete the repair there was no concern that the repair was sub standard in the first place   i was reminded that they warranty all their work   i would never do business with this company again 
this is our weekend breakfast spot  we have ordered many different menu items and they have all been good  fast friendly service too 
this is such a great family place   super kid friendly and sports on tv for the hubby   the pizzas are great and the staff are friendly   my son helped me write this review 
hotel is ok  though they ended up charging the company credit card and my credit card for the same room  ugh  this is such a hassle  are they hurting for   that much   the ac units are about 50 years old and yes  that noisy  even though the rest of the room seemed sort of updated 
steve and his team are professional and they do great work  they explain everything  review the repairs and ask questions to help you make an informed decision  the are very friendly and i trust them  that they have my best interest  with his lifetime warranty it removes all the risk  good old fashion service  integrity and personal touch  they also have the uhauls to rent    i highly recommend them
first  the only complaint our table had was that the waitress brought us an extra tea cup and she reached over the food of us   it would have been preferred that she went around to the guy who asked for the tea cup  other than that  this would be considered one of the best chinese places in henderson to me   they are open until 9   i got the pork fried rice and it was only 5 50  it does come with bean sprouts and onions so if you dont like that just say none please   there was enough left over for lunch the next day   they have tons of different dinner specials that were no more than 10 bucks a plate  and it came with the main entree  tea  soup  rice and egg roll   that was tons of food   my table had the garlic beef  egg foo young  sweet   sour chicken and ribs  everyone enjoyed the food and said it was much better than the strip mall chinese food 
this review is specific to this location   we have been to many chuck es in the vegas location  with our usual being in henderson   this was our first time here  and maybe because it was a saturday night it was insane   this place was packed  tons and tons of kids   several games did not work or stole our tokens  but we were very happy with the different selection of games that we have not seen at the other chuck es   also  there seemed to be a divide of toddler appropriate games on one side and games more skill orienated on the the other side   when we were able to locate a worker to tell them that a certain machine ate our token  they would give us a few extra  maybe because they secretly knew we would lose many tokens in machines that night    the tricky part of the token stealing machines is that they would take your token once and let you play  then when you decide i want to play again  it would steal that token   we did not stand in line for the prizes because there were just too many people   the soda machine was out of ice  but the all you can eat salad bar was usually always freshly stocked and there was usually someone there to give you a new plate  which used to be required by law  but i have noticed the sign about the health department requirement has been removed from all the chuck e salad bars i have been too    as for the gate check guy  he had just left when we arrived to leave and we had to wait about 2 minutes but he was very apologetic   there was a fight in the parking lot from some individuals who had just left a childs birthday party   it was rather scary in that some of the individuals in the argument were in cars and there are obviously small children running in the parking lot     i would probably try this location again  but will not do it on a saturday night 
my favorite burger place of all   really good especially the raspberry drink  the fries are even better  very full after finished all the fries  they have unlimited refill for raspberry tea
great park with lots of open spaces and amenities  plus it has an amazing view  being that it is in a residential area you really get a feel of safety and community unlike some of the other larger parks in town   theres enough space to spread out from the rest of the people enjoying the day which is nice  i am not a fan of going to the park and feeling like i am spending time with a bunch of strangers   i also like that the park is kind of sunken down into the ground so on those windy days it kind of just blows over the fields 
brittany is the best  i have been slightly uncomfortable with other stylists in the past but going to brittany is like being with a friend  i highly recommend seeing her for color  cut or styling  i trust her with it all  she has never disappointed 
we have had two deliveries and both were perfect  this is now who we call for chinese food  very easy to order online 
if you are someone who enjoys coffee but isnt a big fan of coffee flavor  this is probably the place for you  im a huge iced vanilla latte  coffee fan and ive been searching for a place who can whip up the perfect one without having me add extra pumps or shots of this and that and ive finally found it  ive tried coffee bean  cowgirl espresso  starbucks  dutch bros   etc  and have yet to have an iced vanilla latte as good as madhouse coffee  it was the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess  they are a little pricey  but with food and coffee as good as theirs  its completely worth it 
one of my favorite places to eat in vegas  the wait sucks but the food makes it worth it  the palace pan roast is my absolute fav   shrimp  crab  chicken  and andouille sausage in a creamy tomato sauce with a scoop of rice  im drooling as i type  lol large portions too  def enough for two people
dug it  been here before  i brought my parents since we were in the neighborhood  had some shrimp potstickers and tonkotsu ramen  my parents enjoyed it  they like their ramen and have tried a few ramen places in the valley  but they especially liked this one    and theyre asain  so thats worth something  the broth is not too rich with just the right amount of saltiness  the sauce for the potstickers was great too  not a quick and easy soy  it had a good viscosity and mild sweetness  i like that they offer a whiskey ramen pairing  its a great way to try different japanese whiskeys  if you happen to be downtown  check it out 
food very good  small unassuming atmosphere with great seafood  the clam chowder is very peppery so not for the weak at heart 
first time here but  not the last  this is a hidden gem of las vegas  everything was fresh and well presented   carder will take care of you so well  you will think you are family 
i hadnt ate here in a few years  from what i had remembered  sharpys made delicious tuna melts   so of course  i ordered a cheeseburger sub  foregoing the delicious memory of the tuna melt   maybe i shouldnt have chased waterfalls  perhaps i should have stuck to the rivers and the lakes that i was used to  huh   something tasted burnt  despite me not seeing any char  the bread at the ends were hard  there was quite a bit of cheese oozing out of my sub that looked like velveeta  i hate velveeta   i wasnt impressed  i could hardly taste the meat as the taste of burnt was a bit overpowering and velveeta was everywhere  bummer   the waffle fries were crunchy  not the yummy kind of crunchy  oh no  more like the   oh man  i forgot about the fries in the oven   kind of crunchy    no bueno  i was disappointed  i probably wont be back 
positives  sure  the apartments are adorable and in a great location  the kitchens have a nice backsplash  and thats about it     negatives  everyone parks a block or two from their apartment  the new management company just blames the old one and doesnt try sorting it out  thats ok  you can just park in an uncovered spot nearby if you have a lot of groceries  right  wrong  this management company is so focused on their bottom line that they sold half of the unreserved uncovered spots in the complex when availability of parking was already a problem    just this month they are repaving the parking lot one section at a time so residents have no place to park at their own home  we received a notice that wed be towed if our car was left in our assigned space after five am on the first day of paving  multiple neighbors have been towed  this is not luxury apartment home living    if you live alone and have a significant other who will be visiting they will have literally no place to park    and thats not it  there are major issues with the old pipe system and bugs and flies crawling up through them  expect your toilet to clog and overflow a lot  expect your sinks to smell strange  expect your neighbors to be an exciting mix of pot smokers and chain smokers    conclusion  dont move here  just dont 
stopped in for some dessert after a great dinner down the street at verses  it was half an hour before closing so the cupcake selection was a bit thin  good thing i was in the mood for ice cream   i was still full from dinner so wanted it to go  unfortunately  they dont serve ice cream to go here  hard to believe  but i was the first to ask for this from the person working  understandably  since this is a major tourist area  everyone  except me  just eats their ice cream immediately  they were as accommodating as they could be putting one container on top of another and it made it back to my hotel room in solid form  very happy it did because this was among the best mint chip ice creams ive ever had 
pretty good restaurant   service average   had the chicken lemon which was very tasty  price seemed reasonable  
a bit difficult to find  ended up at silver city initially but after finding the mandarin just down the street it was smooth sailing  the theatre had a nostalgic feeling and yes it may be a bit  rundown  but it all felt part of an experience  the theatre was clean and well maintained  the only problem id say is the screens were a tad bit small but its not a theatre for action epics or 3d films  it was for those art or drama films where after 10 minutes you forget youre watching on a smaller screen 
without a doubt the biggest up and comer of 2014  and is sure to be growing into multiple locations in 2015   i really really like their chicken and waffles called the chix waffadopolis  they also have other healthy choices that are tasty as well   in case youre not aware skinny fats has a secret menu  ask for the one eyed monster and see what you get  the result will surprise you 
i ordered the cinnamon biscuits and the strawberries were still frozen in the center and the berries were soggy  my husband ordered the shrimp poboy and it was nothing special  pretty bland  we liked the atmosphere  so gave it three stars 
stopped in here for lunch while in vegas  checked in with the yelp app and got a 2 for 1 drink special so that was cool  prices are reasonable for vegas  you can get chips and salsa for  4  good sized portion but nothing special  salsa sort of tasted like spaghetti sauce  ordered the combo fajitas for one  kind of a small portion compared to other mexican restaurants  they dont come with any rice or beans but they were cooked good and flavorful  overall the food was okay but likely would not go back with all the other awesome restaurants in vegas 
so delicious you dont even miss the meat   seriously  the tvp is like a magical bizarro rendition of beef and the yuba bean curd was tasty and filling   the condiments are spot on  so make sure you spring for that guac and try some of the hot sauce   prices are decent for vegan cuisine  and portions are really large   if you arent super hungry you might want to share  sitting area is tiny  hot and somewhat awkward  so i would recommend getting take out and eating in the park if its nice 
as a huge fan of the old sausage king and their amazing pepperettes  i was a little dubious of a new owner coming in  but once i found out that newbie was olliffe butcher   well it was like winning the meat superbowl    the pepperettes arent just as good as the former kings  they are better  spicier and slightly more cured than their predecessor  they are an explosion of awesome in your mouth    and dont let me forget about the sandwiches   having worked in the st  lawrence market area for some time   im not such a huge fan of the lunch time offerings available there   but now that there is a new kid on the block ive stopped making faces when my colleagues suggest the market  ive had the porchetta all dressed w   crackling  and before yall get up in arms yes they do have crackling  but since it takes 40hrs to make  you have to know when to go  wednesdays  thursdays   and it was super tasty   bbq beef brisket was also good  but almost just a little too much for one human to nosh without consequence  but the shining star for me is the deli sandwich  specifically the bierschinken   a german mortadella style cold cut   sausage king by olliffe also has nitrate free hot dogs and their famous sausage available during lunch as well as a whole plethora of meaty goodness you can take home and cook yourself 
terrible employees  they mumble inaudibly when speaking  dont listen to your order and are all around unfriendly  i have never felt to uncomfortable while ordering food 
my mouth is full  full of compliments  excellent  excellent  excellent   staff food  price wife is happy im happy   thank you
i love the henry    i usually go for brunch but went with a girlfriend for friday night dinner and drinks  everything was great  seth our waiter was amazing  so friendly  attentive and we were never without anything  i tried his signature dish  the bolognese with the braised short rib on top      to die for    thanks seth      erin
very good  not the typical thai  great addition to the hood  love that the have hitachino beer   nice touch 
this place did the job  it provided edible food in a clean environment at a somewhat decent price at 11pm on a saturday night   however  to say it left something to be desired would be accurate  perhaps it was due to the time of day  but the menu offerings were pretty slim  i seriously flipped through it three times  thinking surely id missed something  i ended up ordering their two egg plate that came with hash browns and toast  the bf got an angel hair pasta dish w   tomatoes and an olive oil sauce  the food was just okay  our waitress was very friendly  attentive  and kept the cocktails coming    however  id venture to say that unless i really didnt have any other option and didnt feel like walking anywhere else  id probably pass on eating here again 
the bf and i were at the venetian for a convention  we decided to take a break and headed over to the shops to sit down and take a break  we just happened to walk by zeffrino  and headed to the bar  the decor is pretty nice in here  large bar area and some comfy lounge chairs too in a dimly lit environment  which can be useful in vegas for several reasons    i want to say it was 2 00 or 3 00pm on sunday  but the bartender said it was happy hour    if you say so  i got my standard cosmo  the bf a bloody mary  tasty and generous w   the vodka     they also offer little bowls of mini pretzels  an unexpected bonus  we sat there  relaxed  watched some pre season football on their tvs and enjoyed  very reasonably priced  i think w   my bfs second round  the bill came out to be less than  25    i didnt try the food  but after receiving great service here  ill definitely come back for lunch or dinner next time im in vegas 
i take my son every couple weeks  we never have to wait long and the service is top notch  a true kut above the rest  everytime you walk in they great you like theyve known you forever  they keep my little dude looking fly 
ive been a goodlife member for 5 years  i love goodlife and their facilities  ive been here twice and its the worst gym ive ever been to  its absolutely disgusting  the change rooms are nasty  washroom floors are covered in urine  counters are soaked with water and soap   hair everywhere  the gym area is filled with posers on the phone or just hanging out  socializing and taking selfies  weight racks are empty because the floor is littered with dumbells and plates  there is absolutely no gym etiquette in this place  both times have been the same  they have 3 4 staff members at the front desk just chatting away  they should either enforce the rules or do some work and clean this place up  this is a brand new facility and should not be in this state  shame on you goodlife for letting it get so bad  someone from head office should take a drive one night and see for themselves 
this place is very good  i want to give five star  but i cannot  a server  yamada  is the only obstacle for this restaurant  we asked take out for rice balls  omelet  and fried chicken and make it like a bento box  she said there is no way that she can make it like that without asking to her manager  we called them up about an hour later whether they can make it  if not  we can do by ourselves  it was not a big deal  but her attitude was rude  i know it takes time a bit  so she does not wanna do it  but she could ask her manager and give me an answer  she was just stubborn  thats all  who does want to pay tip to her  the answer is simple  nobody   when we pick up our order  their manager was there and said they can accommodate the order like bento box anytime  what a f   ck    i hope the manager teaches yamada how to talk  behave  and deal with customers   overall  it is a good place  but you should go there when she does not work  if she works at there  you should try somewhere else unless you really need 
we went on a referral from the hotel we were staying at and boy what a gem  luckily a reservation a had cancelled so we were lucky and were seated right away  reservations recommended   the staff was so helpful as we had our 1 year old with us  just go they are great and food was awesome you wont be disappointed  we are making this a regular spot for our italian 
nadias hair studio is absolutely the greatest hair salon in the local phoenix area  i got a same day appointment and she sat me down listened to my style concerns and created the greatest haircut i have ever got in 47 years  barry scheurweghs
greatest company i ever had pleasure of working with     they treated my mom   dad like family   i will never forget that      they got a great trade in value and an awesome 2015 pre owned motorhome   call me anytime for any questions   barry scheurweghs 480 360 1864
i came in limping  can barely walk  the rt named jeffrey let me limp right by a wheelchair not in use  i said   a wheelchair would be nice  he ignored me  asked me where the pain was  i told him where it had been   then stood up to check and it moved so i showed him now where it was   i got a snarly   oh  so now its over there  like i am an idiot or a liar  hopefully the dr will treat me better   not the first time i have disliked the way this guy talked to me   girl at the front desk recognized me  apparently i come in here too much   she was awesome and brought me the paperwork so i didnt have to get up    this pa i got was fantastic  very skilled in muscle issues  quite friendly and knowledgeable  she kicks it up to 4 stars 
fried chicken salad was really good  good service  only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth  i said no  a table  arrived on time and it was packed   and they had saved us a booth   kind of pricey  though  unless you get the happy hour specials  and there were families with kids in there  little kids  so its ok to bring your family 
this review is for the pharmacy only   i get to the counter and there is another customer staring at me  so i try to discreetly say my name and i am here for my rx   because who needs this other busybody with nothing to do hearing my business   the surly white haired man in the blue costco jacket named russ whose title says  cashier  stares at me and barks  somber faced  i cant hear you   last name  then proceeds to tell me that there are 500 rxs being processed and mine will be a while   i called 1  2 h ago    so they did get it ready   but he again reprimanded me because i wanted to use their discount program  as my insurance doesnt allow me to use costco  i asked him  why do you need to redo paperwork    did the dr put my insurance info on the e rx  i have no clue  more barking   i made note that they are right next to the hearing aid counter as i sat down to wait   todd the pharmacist was happy and kind  he is the only reason i bumped them from 1 star to 2  russ  buddy  time to retire and get that hearing aid rx filled right there at your local costco 
old world bakery for sure  fresh  delicious danish   but  watch out for the witchy clerk behind the counter  you wont be coming back on account of her non affable style 
great visit on a friday afternoon   this was my first visit here   food was great   love how it was made fresh   plenty of staff on a busy day   the place looked clean and presented very well     i will certainly be back   i really enjoyed that my wife and i were able to eat for less than twenty bucks 
one of the reasons i was so excited for my trip to vegas was also for my trip to the abc store in vegas  its a chain in hawaii  so i go there pretty often when im back home   i was so happy when i got to this location and saw it was just like home   just with vegas souvenirs of course   so excited to stock up on mauna loa treats  island girl cosmetics  nail polish too wooooo  and other things you can find back home   the pricing was a lot cheaper than other convenience stores ive seen around the strip   we got our vegas souvenirs here and were shocked at how low cost they were  they also sell liquor here   i love you  abc store 
i literally had one of the funnest nights ever here at tao  ive been wanting to check out the place forever  so when we planned our recent trip to las vegas  i knew it was going to be a must do  we went through a promoter  who was so awesome  he got the 6 of us comp entry and told us the best time to arrive so the girls could take advantage of the open bar  getting in was a breeze  the place is beautiful  extremely well kept  it was sooo packed  but understandably  it was a saturday night  the bartenders were nice  which ive never ever experienced in a club before  lol  the dj was phenomenal  kept us dancing all night  the bathrooms werent so clean  but i guess its hard to keep it clean with drunkards everywhere  there was an awesome photo booth for free pics  the balcony had a great view  literally everything about this place blew me away  exceeded my expectations for sure  
no no no  this place was so bad  we had been talking about this hookah  bar for days  so we were excited to check it out on our last night   so  we arrive about 10 30pm and every table was filled so we are told itd be about a 30 minute wait   while we are discussing our plan of action  the hostess comes and tells us there is a party leaving and she can seat us now   yay  turns out  that was a bad thing   the seating area is gorgeous  couches are huge and comfy and the strip views are awesome  we even had a view of the mirage volcano   the server comes up right away and takes our drink order while we are looking over the menu   i kid you not  35 40 minutes go by and the woman has not even so much as looked our direction   after all 6 of us give her the stare down  she comes and asks us if she can get us anything   we inform her we never got the drinks we ordered  her response   i know   what  she goes on to say that her bartender sucks  ummm    then we ask her about the hookah   she tells us that you need to go in the back to order the hookah  what the heck  no sign  nobody even told us   how were we supposed to know we had to get up and go order the hookah elsewhere   the server finally brings us our drinks and they are horrible  watered down  just absolute garbage   i told her i didnt want mine and she kind of gave me some attitude publicly     then apologized to me privately  saying she was mad at the bartender and didnt mean to take it out on me  unbelievable   the hookah was kinda lame   we tried like 5 different flavors   all weak   the only good flavor was the blueberry     places like this are why yelp needs a zero star option 
jean mark has transformed my hair  the color and cut are amazing i would highly recommend him  thank you
i wish i could give this buffet 3 5 stars  but i cant   we were super hungry  so are expectations were low  the wynns lunch buffet was pretty much the same price as the mandalay bay one  and that one looked like a sizzler  the eating room was extremely nice looking  and the staff was quick and friendly  there was a ton of different food to choose from  those are the pluses   the minuses  well  the food wasnt that great  the sushi was terrible  the pasta was mediocre  the meats were mostly good  but not great  there were a lot of interesting ceviches to try  that was a plus  basically  there were 75 different dishes i sampled small bites of  and only two or three warranted another taste  one of those was the pizza  which was surprisingly good  but not exactly what i came for  the other was as asian inspired dish  though most of the asian stuff was bland  with green beans and really yummy bits of steak   i just missed breakfast  and wasnt there for the dinner ive read about  so maybe i just hit it at a bad time   as for the dessert  man  was it pretty  but thats about it  the girlfriend really dug the candied apple  granted  i wasnt very hungry at that point  but i didnt think any of the many colorful deserts were all that great 
miley is the best  i come from california to have my nails done with her  always nice  sweet and efficient   
their food quality top notch  typical japanese izakaya that does not stop introducing new fusion style food such as japa  mini  burgers  fried pork belly and their oyster is great as well  i really liked their atmosphere
the concept of hk egg waffles and ice cream lately has been way popular and i am enjoying it   we dropped by woofles   cream around 7 10pm on a saturday to find that they were temporarily closed as they ran out of woofles  and would reopen at 8pm   we decided to stick around   they reopened slightly shy of 8pm and there had been a line of at least 10 people  good thing we hopped in line when it started to form  there was about a 5 minute wait after we ordered our woofles  which isnt bad as there was no prior bottleneck of orders   i got the cookies   cream woofle with twist ice cream and it was delicious  this treat is a little on the pricey side    8  but i wouldnt mind coming again if there was no lineup 
amazing service and efficiency at this location  this is one of the quickest booster juice locations ive been to  the other ones always seem to have long lines not because of many customers   just because there is usually one staff there   my fav smoothie from here is the strawberry storm    
ew  just straight ew  im sorry this place stinks  maybe it is the best charlotte has to offer  but it is just gross in there   no drinks for brunch  you have to have a drink menu if you are going to call yourself a brunch spot   also  fruit was blah and the hamburger was the nastiest thing i have ever eaten  fail
my wife and i ate here for lunch   overall we enjoyed our visit   the place is a new renovation of what used to be an old market   its nice inside  nothing incredible  basically what youd expect from a brew pub  but it was clean and tastefully decorated   there are logos from local breweries painted on the wall  and some fat heads artwork around along with some of their beer awards to round on the decor   our only complaint was that the high ceilings and large amount of hard surfaces made it kinda noisy inside   it wasnt bad during lunch when the place wasnt crowded  but with more people it might have been bothersome   as for the food  i ordered a club sandwich and my wife ordered a burger   both were good and portion sizes were very  very  large   i felt like i definitely got my moneys worth   there were also some homages to cleveland on the menu with dishes featuring brats and pierogi   everything tends towards the large size though  even advertising some of the sandwiches on the menu as  as big as your head    so if thats what youre looking for  then youll love it  but if you like smaller portions you might struggle to find something order   my advice is just get a takeout box   now we come to the real reason we went to fat heads  the beer   fat heads own brews are award winning stuff   their own head hunter ipa has won many awards and is considered the best ipa in the country right now    they also have many high quality micro brews from other breweries  bells  bear republic  great divide  founders  etc   on tap   if you love good beer and are in the area you owe it to yourself to stop by   all in all we like out visit and will probably go back when were in town 
we were looking for something quick and inexpensive  and weve been wanting to try jjs for a while  for about  6 50 i got a coney chili cheese dog with onion rings and a drink  when the food was ready  i was actually surprised by how much i got for the price  the hotdog was good and the onion rings were very good  my wife got the fries which were not bad either  its not every day that im in the mood for a hotdog  but next time i am  well be back at jjs 
ive been a clint here since i was in high school  no complains   always clean  price is good  will continuing to come  
the ultimate post beach snack  a must if you have spent the day soaking up the sun at mentor headlands  serving sizes are huge and great price  ive supported this local business for 10  years  wonderful establishment 
i love this location  crew is very friendly and polite  besides amazing yogurt  they keep the store clean  water is also available in a cool container with a little fountain  this is weird  but their bathroom is one of the best bathrooms ive ever used  its clean and has an awesome design  great location 
waitresss service was not good  dishers left some green stuff at the bottom  inside  of my cup  and i noticed this towards my last sips  also  the waitress did not bring my friends change  it was not much  but who does that  we waited a while and then decided to leave  on the other side  the food was satisfying  3 stars overall 
lovely mom   pop feel  vendors of all different types of foods from meats to pastries  cheese  spices  pasta  fruits  veggies  great prices  we love walking around discovering new things and getting inspiration for our meals at home 
a colossal disappointment  these cupcakes are huge  but lacking in quality   flavor  just my opinion  everything looks cute though  including the decor 
best ever   i have suffered migraines forever and she was able to make them almost non existant   it took 12 sessions  but she has a very affordable treatment plan   well worth it  
best meal bucket for sure  im a tourist in toronto and this place is totally walkable from the rom  university of toronto  its a must do   dont miss it and trade in an amazing food journey at rasa for a tourist trap advertised by a hotel concierge    this is the place to go  and my kids loved it too   i have no food pictures because we inhaled it all while giving each other meaningful looks   enjoy
